# Tucker: This should make you nervous
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's Unhappy Monday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=0.0s)]
*  Things are changing fast, as you know, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  and you can tell how fast they're changing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=4.26s)]
*  by the way that people talk about politics. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Language reflects feelings and thoughts. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=8.08s)]
*  When your views change, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=10.72s)]
*  so does the way you talk about them. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=11.56s)]
*  And that's especially true of liberals [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=12.6s)]
*  who have very deep feelings. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=13.92s)]
*  And their main feeling, this has always been true, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=15.32s)]
*  is contempt for you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  If you ever listened to NPR, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=20.16s)]
*  you know exactly how much contempt liberals have for you [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=21.28s)]
*  and you get to pay for it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=24.8s)]
*  NPR takes your tax dollars [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=25.64s)]
*  and then lectures you about how immoral you are. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=27.6s)]
*  That is liberalism distilled. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=29.86s)]
*  It's been going on a long time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=31.38s)]
*  NPR has been running its particular scam since 1971, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  but the sneering tone you hear on NPR [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=37.06s)]
*  has been the hallmark of liberals for nearly a century. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=39.3s)]
*  Liberals have contempt for Dwight Eisenhower [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=42.5s)]
*  and for Barry Goldwater and for Richard Nixon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=44.66s)]
*  Boy, did they, and for Gerald Ford even. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=46.66s)]
*  If you're old enough to remember Ronald Reagan, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  you will recall vividly how liberals felt about him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Reagan was an idiot, they told you, a mouth breather. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=54.22s)]
*  And so was anybody who would vote for him [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=56.86s)]
*  very much including you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=58.78s)]
*  In the words of Al Gore, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=60.7s)]
*  Republicans were the quote, extra chromosome right wing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=61.94s)]
*  So they were literally genetically defective. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=65.58s)]
*  That's how liberals actually talk. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=69.0s)]
*  Wherever two or more liberals are gathered, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=71.12s)]
*  you will find sanctimony. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=73.1s)]
*  But there's a new inflection. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=76.1s)]
*  You may have noticed it recently. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=77.86s)]
*  The pivot, and it was a pivot, came six years ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=79.16s)]
*  It was during the 2016 presidential campaign. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  Liberals seemed to lose any remaining sense of humor [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=84.54s)]
*  the moment Donald Trump arrived. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=87.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  Well, because he called their bluff. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=90.56s)]
*  Looking back, it's obvious what happened. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=91.82s)]
*  By 2016, no one could argue that liberal programs [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=93.84s)]
*  or many programs, the various fads and metaphorical wars, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=98.24s)]
*  we are waging on this or that bad thing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=101.61999999999999s)]
*  There was no evidence that any of it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  had done anything to improve American life. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  Liberals promised you they would make everything great, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=109.38s)]
*  but they didn't. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=111.78s)]
*  In fact, every single liberal enthusiasm failed, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  from radical feminism to urban renewal, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  from outsourcing to the so-called sharing economy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=119.78s)]
*  All of them, each and every one, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=122.92s)]
*  turned out to be a complete disaster. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=124.64s)]
*  The reason 2016 was significant is that's the year [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=127.5s)]
*  liberals could no longer deny this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=131.24s)]
*  They couldn't say, give us another 50 years [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=132.76s)]
*  and we'll turn Baltimore into Geneva. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=134.36s)]
*  They couldn't say that because no one would believe it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=137.36s)]
*  Not even their own voters would believe that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=139.10000000000002s)]
*  So for liberals, 2016 was a profoundly humiliating moment [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=142.36s)]
*  and those can be good. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, adjusted adults learn from humiliating moments, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=148.10000000000002s)]
*  but that's not what liberals did. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=150.68s)]
*  They turned their rage outward and they focused that rage [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=152.4s)]
*  on the people they had failed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  You always hate the ones you betray. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=158.02s)]
*  So liberals decided they hated the American middle class. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  In 2016, Democrats stopped making arguments [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=164.52s)]
*  in favor of their own policies, whatever those might be, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=166.94000000000003s)]
*  and instead reoriented the entire party [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=170.24s)]
*  around attacking the very people [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=172.52s)]
*  that historically they had represented. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=174.28s)]
*  Again, America's middle class. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=176.4s)]
*  Now they hated them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=178.36s)]
*  At a fundraiser she thought was off the record, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=180.36s)]
*  Hillary Clinton summed up the contempt all of them felt. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=185.74s)]
*  You could put half of Trump supporters [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=186.68s)]
*  into what I call the basket of deplorables. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Islamophobic, you name it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=196.24s)]
*  A gaffe. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=200.4s)]
*  Yeah, in the sense she was telling you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  exactly what she really thinks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=203.4s)]
*  She meant every word of that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  and the applause that she received was heartfelt too. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=207.44s)]
*  They all felt that way. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=210.36s)]
*  And that's why 2016 was the year that you [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=212.28s)]
*  and everybody else became a racist. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=215.52s)]
*  It was the worst slur they could think of. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=218.10000000000002s)]
*  They used it every day of the 2016 campaign. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  Racist, racist, racist. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, in the end, and they hated this above all, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=224.58s)]
*  Donald Trump won more non-white votes [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=226.44s)]
*  than any Republican presidential candidate ever, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=228.88s)]
*  but they didn't stop. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=230.96s)]
*  No, they just increased the volume. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=232.92s)]
*  And by 2020, a lot of Americans were just exhausted. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=235.76s)]
*  Fine, we'll vote for a mannequin. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=239.4s)]
*  If only you will calm down. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=241.44s)]
*  That was the unspoken yet very clear deal [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  that liberals made with the country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=246.6s)]
*  If you ditch the orange man, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=248.04s)]
*  we will stop screaming and burning your cities [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=249.76s)]
*  and we can be all Americans again. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=251.76s)]
*  So people voted for Biden. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=254.28s)]
*  Maybe not 81 million, but some people did. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  But Democrats didn't mean it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=258.56s)]
*  By January of last year, the Democratic Party [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=260.56s)]
*  had more power than at any time since FDR was president. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=262.56s)]
*  But the telling point, the tip off, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=266.1s)]
*  was they didn't seem happy about it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=269.2s)]
*  If anything, they seemed angrier than ever. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=270.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=273.08s)]
*  Because they had lost faith in their own program. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=274.42s)]
*  They controlled everything, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=278.04s)]
*  but they had no interest in making things better. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=279.4s)]
*  They were no longer interested at all in social improvement. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=283.36s)]
*  Social security, they bragged about that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=287.0s)]
*  for almost a hundred years. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=288.72s)]
*  They stopped talking about it head start, remember that? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=289.72s)]
*  Improving public schools. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=292.08s)]
*  These were all liberal enthusiasms. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=293.72s)]
*  They tried them all and none of them worked. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=296.0s)]
*  So they moved in the other direction. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=298.52s)]
*  Instead of trying to fix the country, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=300.12s)]
*  they decided to destroy the country and just start over. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=301.64s)]
*  If you were watching from outside, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=304.64s)]
*  it looked like they were having a fit. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=306.24s)]
*  They erupted into uncontrollable nihilistic rage. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=308.2s)]
*  They swept the plates off the table, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=311.52s)]
*  punched a hole in the drywall, threw a vase to the TV. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=312.84s)]
*  Burn it down, let's start over. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  They called this the equity agenda. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  And you should have been nervous [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=322.24s)]
*  when you listened to them talk about it, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=323.36s)]
*  because every time they talked about the equity agenda, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=324.56s)]
*  they scowled. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=327.16s)]
*  Joe Biden looked angry at his own inauguration. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=329.16s)]
*  He had promised hope, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=331.64s)]
*  but in the end he delivered division and rage. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=333.5s)]
*  This is Biden on the day he became president. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  And now, a rise of political extremism, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=340.52s)]
*  white supremacy, domestic terrorism [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=344.52s)]
*  that we must confront and we will defeat. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  Our history has been a constant struggle [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=351.64s)]
*  between the American ideal that we're all are created equal [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=354.76s)]
*  and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=359.24s)]
*  nativism, fear, demonization [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=363.28s)]
*  have long torn us apart. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=367.68s)]
*  The battle is perennial. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=371.2s)]
*  Huh, what was that? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=373.44s)]
*  That wasn't the deal. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  We got rid of the orange man [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=376.52s)]
*  and you're still calling me racist? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=377.88s)]
*  Why are you doing that? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=380.38s)]
*  Why aren't you trying to unite the country? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Why don't you win over the people who didn't vote for you? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=383.44s)]
*  They didn't spend one day doing that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=387.06s)]
*  Instead, they moved in the opposite direction at high speed. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=390.22s)]
*  They all of a sudden declared that trespassing was a felony [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=394.02s)]
*  and through Trump voters in prison, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=397.06s)]
*  a lot of them are still there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  They said about politicizing [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=401.78s)]
*  the most heavily armed federal agencies [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=403.14s)]
*  from the FBI to DHS to the Pentagon. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=405.38s)]
*  That should make you nervous. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  And they did it for a reason [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=409.17999999999995s)]
*  because they believed their political opponents [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=410.41999999999996s)]
*  were criminals. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=411.94s)]
*  And you know that because they said so. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=413.06s)]
*  They called them Nazis and white supremacists. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=414.41999999999996s)]
*  You, you're not a Nazi or white supremacist. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=416.02s)]
*  Why are they calling you that? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=418.58s)]
*  Why are they denouncing you as a seditionist, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  an enemy of the state? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=421.98s)]
*  Why are they demanding the government censor [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=424.78s)]
*  and disarm you because they think you're a terrorist? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=426.62s)]
*  They deployed thousands of national guard troops [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=429.78s)]
*  to your Capitol and kept them there for months. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=435.1s)]
*  Against Americans? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=435.94s)]
*  We weren't being invaded. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=436.96s)]
*  Those were Trump voters they claimed to be afraid of. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=438.38s)]
*  They began using language [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=441.5s)]
*  that even the most radical Democrat in Congress [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=443.18s)]
*  just six years ago would have thought was way too extreme. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=445.62s)]
*  And it was just a few of them who did this. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=449.02s)]
*  Virtually all of them did it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=450.64s)]
*  Certain dates echo throughout history. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=454.0s)]
*  December 7th, 1941, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  September 11th, 2001, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=460.4s)]
*  and January 6th, 2021. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=464.18s)]
*  Similar to Pearl Harbor and 9-11. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=466.88s)]
*  We can now add January 6th, 2021 [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  to that very short list of dates in American history [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=474.8s)]
*  that will live forever in infamy. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=478.62s)]
*  The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=481.58s)]
*  The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=485.06s)]
*  And this was the worst attack on our democracy [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=489.46s)]
*  since the Civil War. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=491.9s)]
*  The worst single act of political violence [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=493.58s)]
*  since the Civil War. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=495.34000000000003s)]
*  The worst attack on American democracy, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  arguably, probably since the Civil War. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=498.66s)]
*  The one six attacks are likely to kill a lot more Americans [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=501.06s)]
*  than were killed on the 9-11 attacks. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=505.06s)]
*  January 6th was worse than 9-11. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=507.22s)]
*  Why are they talking like that? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=510.58000000000004s)]
*  It's so obviously untrue, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=511.86s)]
*  and yet they're all reading from the same script. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=513.82s)]
*  There has to be a purpose here. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=516.5s)]
*  They're not doing this accidentally. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=518.2s)]
*  People don't use identical chunks of language [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=519.5400000000001s)]
*  on the same day by accident. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=522.14s)]
*  They thought this through. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=524.7s)]
*  And then they began putting people on television [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=526.38s)]
*  whose only qualification was their willingness [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=528.14s)]
*  to say things that, again, three years ago [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=532.22s)]
*  would have been considered beyond the pale. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=534.1800000000001s)]
*  And that's just a few of them, a lot of them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=537.38s)]
*  Here's a former Trump administration lackey [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=539.3000000000001s)]
*  telling you with a straight face [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=541.14s)]
*  that the Republican Party is a bigger threat to this nation [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=542.4200000000001s)]
*  than Al-Qaeda or ISIS. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=545.5400000000001s)]
*  Radicalized elements of the Republican Party [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=548.34s)]
*  now represent a bigger threat to our democracy [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=550.98s)]
*  than organizations like Al-Qaeda or ISIS ever did. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=554.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, not necessarily to human lives, not necessarily, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=558.26s)]
*  but a bigger threat to our democracy [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=561.4200000000001s)]
*  than those terrorist groups ever did. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=563.26s)]
*  So why are they talking this way? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=566.06s)]
*  Well, what else are they gonna talk about? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  Their record in Detroit for the last 60 years? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=569.6199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=571.9399999999999s)]
*  The Democratic Party decided the only way [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=572.88s)]
*  it could maintain power when the next election [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=575.4599999999999s)]
*  is to convince you, the voter, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=578.3399999999999s)]
*  that the other side is dangerous, literally dangerous, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  not metaphorically dangerous, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=585.04s)]
*  actually dangerous to your life. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=586.0999999999999s)]
*  The problem is you have to up the ante in every election. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=589.38s)]
*  If they're white supremacists this election, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=592.5799999999999s)]
*  what are they next election? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=594.34s)]
*  Nazis and then what? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=595.46s)]
*  John Brennan, the former CIA director said [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=597.74s)]
*  he looked forward to an authoritarian crackdown. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=599.86s)]
*  You'll notice he lumps in libertarians [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=602.94s)]
*  with fascist bigots and racists, watch this. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=606.7s)]
*  Looking forward that the members of the Biden team [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=610.0600000000001s)]
*  who have been nominated or have been appointed [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=613.34s)]
*  are now moving in laser-like fashion [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=616.86s)]
*  to try to uncover as much as they can [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=619.4000000000001s)]
*  about what looks very similar to insurgency movements [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=621.42s)]
*  that we've seen overseas, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=625.0999999999999s)]
*  where they germinate in different parts of the country [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=626.78s)]
*  and they gain strength [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=629.26s)]
*  and it brings together an unholy alliance frequently [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=630.6999999999999s)]
*  of religious extremists, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=633.9s)]
*  so authoritarians, fascists, bigots, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=636.14s)]
*  racists, nativists, even libertarians. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=639.14s)]
*  That was the month that Joe Biden was inaugurated, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=644.18s)]
*  the month you'd think liberals like John Brennan [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=647.9399999999999s)]
*  would be celebrating Trump's departure, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=650.62s)]
*  but again, they were angrier than ever [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=652.86s)]
*  and they've gotten angrier since that day. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=654.82s)]
*  So where's this going? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=656.66s)]
*  Well, it's going the only place it ever could go. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=657.78s)]
*  Democrats have reached the logical end of name-calling. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=661.1s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=664.34s)]
*  Because they've run out of epithets. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=665.18s)]
*  Once you've accused your political opponents [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=666.5s)]
*  of being Nazis, white supremacists, and then of treason, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=668.26s)]
*  you have reached the limits of language. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=672.02s)]
*  When you're dealing with someone who's committed treason, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=674.98s)]
*  it is now a law enforcement matter. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=677.14s)]
*  People are gonna have to be physically punished. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=679.8199999999999s)]
*  So not surprisingly, that is what they are now calling for. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=682.42s)]
*  Arrest them! [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=685.38s)]
*  All of a sudden you're hearing a lot of liberals say that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=687.06s)]
*  Not just the crazies, but the mainstream people. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=690.74s)]
*  Willard Mitt Romney, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=693.74s)]
*  a man who's probably never used the F-word [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=694.9s)]
*  in his entire life, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=697.18s)]
*  is suddenly accusing Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=698.74s)]
*  one of the most reasonable people ever to serve in the body, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=702.02s)]
*  of treason. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=704.62s)]
*  Not accusing her of being mistaken or wrong, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=706.1s)]
*  but accusing her of betraying her country, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=708.78s)]
*  even as she serves it in uniform. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=711.26s)]
*  What's the penalty for that? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=713.74s)]
*  Well, it's prison, at least. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=715.6999999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=717.66s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is being accused [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=719.18s)]
*  of spreading Russian false flag propaganda. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=721.38s)]
*  And I think DOJ, in the same way that it is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=724.6999999999999s)]
*  setting up a task force to investigate oligarchs, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=728.14s)]
*  should look into people who are Russian propagandists [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=730.74s)]
*  and shilling for Putin. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=733.98s)]
*  They used to arrest people for doing stuff like this. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=735.18s)]
*  If they thought you were colluding with a Russian agent, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=738.34s)]
*  if they thought you were putting out information [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=742.9s)]
*  or taking information and handing over to Russia. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=745.0600000000001s)]
*  They used to actually investigate stuff like this. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=748.14s)]
*  And I guess now, you know, there seems to be no bars. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=750.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's the view, they're harpies, they're ridiculous, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=756.02s)]
*  they're stupid, all true. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=758.7800000000001s)]
*  But what was so surprising [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=760.6600000000001s)]
*  is that that wasn't even considered much of a news story. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=762.3000000000001s)]
*  It's that common. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=764.7s)]
*  A liberal fundraising group called Call to Action [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=767.14s)]
*  is now demanding the arrest of Clarence Thomas's wife, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=769.62s)]
*  Ginny Thomas, someone who, as far as we know, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=773.06s)]
*  hasn't done anything wrong apart from marrying a man [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=775.3s)]
*  that liberals don't like. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=777.9s)]
*  So even five years ago, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=779.62s)]
*  if some liberal group was raising money on the idea [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=780.98s)]
*  Ginny Thomas should be arrested [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=783.02s)]
*  because she's married to Clarence Thomas, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=784.62s)]
*  that would have seemed demented. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=786.42s)]
*  Now it's just another cable news segment. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=788.06s)]
*  A lot of them are like that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=789.78s)]
*  Here's former Fox reporter, Carl Cameron, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=791.14s)]
*  on CNN this weekend, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=792.74s)]
*  calling for us, this show, to be sent to prison [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=793.9s)]
*  because that's now the fair penalty [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=796.4599999999999s)]
*  for disagreeing with Joe Biden. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=798.54s)]
*  Jail time. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=799.6999999999999s)]
*  And the host of the show on CNN seems to think [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=800.78s)]
*  that sounds about right. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=803.22s)]
*  In this particular case, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=805.22s)]
*  Tucker has been screaming fire [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=807.22s)]
*  in a crowded movie house for years. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=809.62s)]
*  And that cliche really comes to the matter [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=811.9399999999999s)]
*  of what is free speech. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=816.06s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=818.66s)]
*  if you disturb the peace by starting a riot [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=819.74s)]
*  in a movie theater, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=821.6999999999999s)]
*  cops are going to arrest you [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=822.78s)]
*  and you might end up in jail, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=823.86s)]
*  or you might end up into something worse. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=824.9399999999999s)]
*  And that kind of stuff absolutely has to stop. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=827.9s)]
*  Whether it's the antitrust bill to take down [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=831.5799999999999s)]
*  and deplatform people who lie [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=835.3s)]
*  and put out falsehoods that cause damage [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=837.4599999999999s)]
*  and violent, violent hate, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=840.62s)]
*  there ought to be something done about it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=844.42s)]
*  And the administration is beginning [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=846.42s)]
*  to actually make a move on that. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=849.74s)]
*  And it's been way overdue. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=852.1s)]
*  Administration is beginning to make a move on that, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=855.1800000000001s)]
*  says the journalist. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=857.62s)]
*  Maybe wind up in jail or maybe something worse, quote. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=860.26s)]
*  Well, what's something worse? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=863.86s)]
*  Well, we're not sure what something worse is, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=865.4200000000001s)]
*  but it certainly feels like we're moving toward it [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=867.46s)]
*  at very high speed at this point. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=869.0600000000001s)]
*  That's the end point to talk like that, something worse. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=870.78s)]
*  Because rhetoric has its own internal logic. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=875.86s)]
*  You've experienced it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=878.5s)]
*  You can talk yourself into things. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=879.32s)]
*  We've all done that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=881.54s)]
*  Democrats are doing it right now. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=883.14s)]
*  And what they're talking themselves into right now [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=885.4599999999999s)]
*  is, quote, something worse. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=887.66s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=889.2199999999999s)]
*  It is time to pull back. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=890.54s)]
*  It is time to deescalate. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=892.9s)]
*  Otherwise, this is going to get really ugly really soon. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT9ETXMCf8&t=895.54s)]
