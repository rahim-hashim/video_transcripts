# Ex-Capitol police officer tells Tucker he was never called by Jan. 6 committee
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc)
*  Tariq Johnson spent 22 years as a Capitol Police officer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=0.0s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=4.24s)]
*  He says he was in charge of securing the certification [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=5.28s)]
*  of the presidential election. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=8.52s)]
*  So he was right in the middle of it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=9.76s)]
*  If anyone was, Tariq Johnson was. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=11.36s)]
*  Here's more of our sit down interview with him. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=13.96s)]
*  Mr. Johnson, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=17.76s)]
*  And thank you for having me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=19.2s)]
*  So from the outside, here's how it looked. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  We now know that huge parts of the federal government [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=22.0s)]
*  were aware that there was gonna be something big [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=25.48s)]
*  happening at the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=27.36s)]
*  They knew there were gonna be big demonstrations there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=29.32s)]
*  And they prepared for that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=31.96s)]
*  But the Capitol Police, on which you served for 22 years, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=33.44s)]
*  did not seem prepared at all. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  And of course, that would be the front line in preparedness. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Was the Capitol Police prepared for that day? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=42.64s)]
*  The front line officers and supervisors [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=44.8s)]
*  were not prepared for that at all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=48.32s)]
*  When you say that, so you had no idea it was coming? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=51.16s)]
*  We knew that there was gonna be a demonstration that day, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=54.24s)]
*  but we had no idea that we were gonna be facing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=56.84s)]
*  what we faced on that actual day. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=59.92s)]
*  So things start to fall apart. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  People stream in the building. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=63.24s)]
*  You call upwards in the command chain. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=64.48s)]
*  Help me, you don't get a response. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  What do you do next? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  So around two o'clock, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  it may have been a little bit after two o'clock, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=73.4s)]
*  I hear a officer say that the Capitol was breached. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=76.12s)]
*  So I ran inside of the building, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  I ran to assist. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=82.28s)]
*  I knew that that location of where the first breach occurred [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=84.72s)]
*  was near where the members of Congress would be locked in. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  We initiated a lockdown, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=93.2s)]
*  so that means the chamber doors on the Senate side [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=94.56s)]
*  and the House side were locked. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=96.92s)]
*  So that means the members of Congress would be safe [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=98.2s)]
*  inside those locked rooms. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=100.16s)]
*  So I ran over to the House side first [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=102.08s)]
*  to make sure that those doors were locked, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=105.64s)]
*  then I ran over to the Senate side [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=107.2s)]
*  to make sure those doors were locked. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=108.4s)]
*  So I asked over the radio, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=109.72s)]
*  and I say something to the effect [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=111.2s)]
*  that we need direction, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=112.88s)]
*  we have hundreds of people inside of the building. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=115.52s)]
*  What do you want us to do? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=118.88s)]
*  We need some direction. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=119.96s)]
*  I got, I heard no response. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=121.32s)]
*  No response. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=124.24s)]
*  So, you know, at that particular time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=125.08s)]
*  How could nobody respond? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=128.32s)]
*  Nobody responded. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=129.8s)]
*  At some point you put on a MAGA hat. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=131.0s)]
*  Yes, now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=134.24s)]
*  I think we have it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  I think we have the actual MAGA hat. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=137.0s)]
*  Yes, we actually do have the MAGA hat. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=138.04s)]
*  I have it here in plastic, so here it is. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  J6 it says. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=142.52s)]
*  I labeled it J6. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=144.12s)]
*  So tell us why you put the hat on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=145.16s)]
*  and how that was related to your suspension. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what got me national attention [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  was the wearing of the MAGA hat. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=152.24s)]
*  They were officers, we had a distress call [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=153.72s)]
*  that they were approximately 10 or 11 officers, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  I can't remember the exact number, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=159.0s)]
*  were trapped at the top of the Rotunda steps. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=160.12s)]
*  So I elicited the help of some CDU officers [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=162.16s)]
*  to help me go up the steps. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=165.76s)]
*  And I kept yelling that all the way up the steps, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=167.16s)]
*  giving people high fives, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=169.68s)]
*  trying to make it up the steps to get to the guys. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=170.72s)]
*  And as I was going down, there was a demonstrator on, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=172.96s)]
*  I believe he was on my right side of me, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=177.24s)]
*  so he reached over, I didn't know what he was doing, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  I didn't know if he was gonna hit me, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=180.72s)]
*  and he put the MAGA hat on my head. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  So as I was still trying to walk down the steps, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=185.0s)]
*  then he asked for the hat back. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=187.4s)]
*  And I said, well, I would like to keep it [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=188.72s)]
*  because the hat's gonna help me. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=190.8s)]
*  It's your passport through the crowd. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=193.4s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=195.08s)]
*  So the Capitol Police is by definition nonpartisan, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=196.28s)]
*  it serves both parties in the Congress, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  it protects members of both parties. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=201.32s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  And it has to be that way. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=204.48s)]
*  In the wake of January 6th, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=206.16s)]
*  you saw what looked like partisanship at the Capitol Police. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=208.64s)]
*  Did you perceive that? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=214.44s)]
*  I'm still shocked because as a Capitol Police officer, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=216.2s)]
*  we even had our Chief of Police at the time, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  his name was, well, Steven Son. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=224.0s)]
*  And he called for all the officers [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=226.2s)]
*  who was at work that day, he called for everybody to come in, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=229.84s)]
*  and we all went to Emancipation Hall in the CVC. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=232.2s)]
*  And this was during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=237.0s)]
*  And he told us that as Capitol Police officers, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=241.12s)]
*  we need to stay neutral. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=243.56s)]
*  We need to stay neutral, period. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  So we were like, okay, that's what we do [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=246.88s)]
*  because we protect Democrats, we protect Republicans, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=251.24s)]
*  we protect everybody. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=255.36s)]
*  So we need to stay neutral. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=257.2s)]
*  So then after January 6th, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=258.44s)]
*  you had some police officers who wasn't neutral. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=261.24s)]
*  It didn't seem neutral. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=266.12s)]
*  At all? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=267.16s)]
*  Yeah, and that was an issue, yes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=268.0s)]
*  So, I mean, that devalues the credibility [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=270.32s)]
*  of Capitol Police, doesn't it? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=272.32s)]
*  If they're allowed to be partisan in public. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=273.48s)]
*  They're supposed to be neutral, period. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=275.76s)]
*  Since you were there on January 6th, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=278.0s)]
*  what did you think of the job of the January 6th committee? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=280.88s)]
*  Do you think that they were honest [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=284.0s)]
*  in the way they approached it? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=286.4s)]
*  Do you think they got to the truth? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=287.32s)]
*  I prayed almost daily that they would get to me. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  I was never asked to testify. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  And if you listen to the radio- [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=295.56s)]
*  You were never asked by the January 6th committee? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=297.28s)]
*  I was never asked by anybody connected [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  to the January 6th committee to testify. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=301.67999999999995s)]
*  I asked myself why every day. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=305.56s)]
*  And every day, I might have a different answer, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=308.2s)]
*  but I looked at what pretty much, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duplQw7XCoc&t=310.24s)]
