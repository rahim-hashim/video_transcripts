# Tucker Carlson: These politicians are mimicking civil rights leaders
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. Once you decide that human beings are gods [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=0.0s)]
*  with the power to rewrite history, biology, and nature, the power to shape reality itself, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=5.84s)]
*  once you decide that, there's no reason to stop at sex changes. Transgenderism is certainly [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=10.72s)]
*  faddish at the moment, none of us can stop talking about it, but men magically morphing into women is [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=15.6s)]
*  not the final stage of anything. Instead, it's the first of many similar movements that are on the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=20.96s)]
*  way inevitably. And the few visionaries who have grasped this obvious truth weirdly have not been [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=26.88s)]
*  welcomed by blue America. They have been mocked and derided as prophets always are. A few years [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=32.64s)]
*  ago, for example, a blue-eyed blonde woman from Montana called Rachel Dozal declared that she was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=38.96s)]
*  black because she decided that she was black. Blackness was Rachel Dozal's lived experience. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=43.44s)]
*  But she was not greeted as a liberator, she was almost immediately booed off the stage and then [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=50.16s)]
*  she disappeared. And yet, tellingly, none of the people yelling at Rachel Dozal ever explained why [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=53.84s)]
*  she couldn't be black. Why not? In this country, you can change your sex, but not your race? Really? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  How does that work? What species of science are we talking about here? It was not a defensible [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=66.08s)]
*  argument. And so over time, like all indefensible arguments, it will collapse. Someday, the New [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=71.68s)]
*  York Times will give Rachel Dozal its coveted glass ceiling award for her courage in the face [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=77.2s)]
*  of prejudice. That will happen. But before it does, we'd like to highlight some of the early [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=81.76s)]
*  adopters of our new civic religion, where each of us is God of the universe with utter dominion over [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  nature. These are the trailblazers, the pathfinders, the Daniel Boones of progressive identity politics. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=92.0s)]
*  One of them is a man called Justin Pearson. Pearson has been in the news recently for helping [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  to facilitate an insurrection at the Tennessee State House. You may have seen him. But you may [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  not know what Justin Pearson was like before his transition. Back in 2016, Justin Pearson was an [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=109.52s)]
*  earnest young student at Bowdoin, the whitest college in the whitest state in America, a place [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  that cost 60 grand a year for no obvious reason. A rich kid's school. Here's what Justin Pearson [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=121.52s)]
*  looked like then as he ran for president of student government. I'm Justin J. Pearson, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=128.16s)]
*  and I'm running for president of BSG. There are a few reasons that we're running this campaign this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=134.48s)]
*  year. One has to do with representation. How can we represent all voices in a conversation? I want [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=138.96s)]
*  to bring together different voices, dissenting voices, voices that may be more liberal or more [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=144.8s)]
*  conservative, in order that we can reach a point of sort of the radical middle where conversation [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=149.44s)]
*  and dialogue happens and growth happens. Join the People's Pearson Campaign and let's chart ourselves [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=154.96s)]
*  to a better future. I want to bring everyone together, said Justin Pearson, in a voice that if [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=160.88s)]
*  you closed your eyes, you could easily imagine coming from a suburban orthodontist. Justin Pearson [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=168.32s)]
*  wasn't white, that's probably how we got into Bowdoin in the first place, but he did a fantastic [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=174.16s)]
*  impression of it. What a nice young man. Has he considered the apprenticeship program at Citibank? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=178.48s)]
*  That was the old Justin Pearson before his transition. Here he is now on the floor of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=183.6s)]
*  the Tennessee State House. All hope seemed to be lost. Representatives were thrown out of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=189.04s)]
*  state house. Democracy seemed to be at its end. Seemed like the NRA and gun lobbyists might win. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=196.4s)]
*  But all that was good news for us. I don't know how long this Saturday in the state of Tennessee [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=204.48s)]
*  might last, but oh we have good news folks. We've got good news that Sunday always comes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=211.28s)]
*  Justin Pearson has a dream that one day on the Red Hills of Georgia, everyone will do exactly what [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=219.04s)]
*  he wants or else face indictment by the Department of Justice. Justin Pearson has changed quite [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  dramatically as you can see. He transitioned from a crypto white kid into the modern incarnation of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=229.2s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr. himself. It's remarkable, really, but he's not alone in that. You see this [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=235.28s)]
*  all the time. Everybody in the Democratic Party wants to be Martin Luther King at this point. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=240.32s)]
*  Even Joe Biden, who during the famous march on Washington was enjoying the many benefits of life [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=245.52s)]
*  as a college student in a racially segregated state. Now he's MLK, they all are, but you gotta [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=250.0s)]
*  ask yourself, as long as we're mimicking civil rights leaders who died almost 60 years ago, why [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=255.84s)]
*  not some variety? You never see politicians transition into say Malcolm X. Why is that? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=260.0s)]
*  Maybe because Malcolm X didn't talk like a sharecropper. He spoke dignified standard English. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=266.88s)]
*  He wasn't running a shakedown racket to fleece guilty white liberals. Malcolm X had self-respect, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  so he despised guilty white liberals and he said so. He believed in self-improvement. He knew who [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  the enemy was. So maybe it's not surprising that Malcolm X is not a popular transition choice in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=281.44s)]
*  2023. Al Sharpton, by contrast, is increasingly popular, especially now that he's skinny and has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=287.2s)]
*  a paying job. Sandy Cortez of Westchester recently pulled off a new campaign called the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=294.0s)]
*  Sandy Cortez of Westchester recently pulled off a double transition. Not only did she change sexes, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=298.96s)]
*  Al Sharpton identifies as a man, but races as well. Here she is unveiling her new self [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  in front of Sharpton's own national action network. I'm proud to be a bartender. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  Ain't nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with working retail folding clothes for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  other people to buy. There is nothing wrong with preparing the food that your neighbors will eat. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=325.12s)]
*  There is nothing wrong with driving the buses that take your family to work. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=333.6s)]
*  Ain't nothing wrong with that. In other words, yo my brother, sup. That's not bad for a girl who grew [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=340.32s)]
*  up in an all-white suburb in leafy Westchester county as the daughter of the president of an [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=346.88s)]
*  architectural firm. But don't mention any of that. That's dead naming. These days she'd like a gin [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=351.76s)]
*  and juice with salsa and frijoles because Sandy Cortez doesn't just transition once, she keeps [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=358.08s)]
*  transitioning. She's a cutting-edge shape-shifter who cleps identities the way Amel De Marcos did [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=364.4s)]
*  shoes. So she started life as a privileged white girl, then became a middle-aged black man engaged [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=370.8s)]
*  in the civil rights movement, and then in October she transformed effortlessly into a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=377.36s)]
*  Latinx cartoon character. Watch this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay, I got you. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  You may call that fraudulent, she calls it transitioning. They don't talk like that in Westchester [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=403.92s)]
*  county, but she learned this from the very best. Barack Obama paved the way. Obama grew up with his [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=408.08s)]
*  white mother and white grandparents from Kansas in an apartment in Honolulu, a city that has [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=413.92s)]
*  approximately zero black people. Then he moved to Indonesia, then California and New York. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=419.12s)]
*  But at some point Barack Obama decided he didn't want to be any of the things he actually was, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=424.08s)]
*  so he transitioned. He became, because you can do this now, an African-American Baptist pastor from [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  Chicago with deep roots in Mississippi. Here's Barack Obama post-transition in December. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  The sting of discrimination, the smack of belly clubs weren't tired. If the folks who had to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=460.24s)]
*  fight those early fights, those were the tough fights for union rights and voting rights and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=470.0s)]
*  gay rights and women's rights. If they didn't get tired, you can't be tired. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=477.36s)]
*  Barack Obama is sick and tired of being sick and tired. It was the smack of the belly clubs in [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=482.8s)]
*  Honolulu that did it. It was the fire hoses and snarling German shepherds at Harvard Law School. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  At some point Obama crossed the Edmund Pettus bridge of his mind and transitioned into Ralph [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=493.92s)]
*  Abernathy, except an atheist and much thinner. But Hillary Clinton was there first. She transitioned [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=499.6s)]
*  when he didn't even know what the word meant, and in some ways Hillary made an even longer journey. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  She was identified by an obstetrician at birth as the daughter of an executive from the suburban [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=510.64s)]
*  Midwest, but inside she always knew she was very different from that. She was trapped inside a body [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=516.56s)]
*  that wasn't hers. But it wasn't until 2007 that Hillary Clinton finally mustered the courage to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=521.92s)]
*  identify as what she was all along, a politically aware gospel singer from the segregated South. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=528.48s)]
*  Here she is on the Chitlin circuit in Alabama. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=535.04s)]
*  I don't feel no ways tired. I come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me that the road would be easy. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=537.68s)]
*  Performing tonight, ladies and gentlemen, at Constitution Hall. Joe Biden actually was born [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=551.5999999999999s)]
*  in a slave state and as we mentioned for the first nearly 30 years of his life enjoyed all the many [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=557.3599999999999s)]
*  perks of living in a Jim Crow city. But that's not a story that audiences are interested in hearing a lot about at this point. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  So Joe Biden did what we are all now allowed to do in modern America. He erased his former identity. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=573.36s)]
*  You saw this recently with the trans admiral. He declared it never happened. You can't know what happened. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=579.2s)]
*  It's a dead name. And he transitioned into something else. So Joe Biden still grew up in a segregated [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=584.08s)]
*  state, but now he was the one at the back of the bus filling the thump of the billy club. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=589.76s)]
*  The sting of the fire hose. Joe Biden is now black. Watch. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=598.08s)]
*  A senator from Florida going after Medicare and Social Security? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=603.92s)]
*  I tell you what, I don't know where, as they say in Southern, doesn't know where you all been. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=609.36s)]
*  Hot damn, boy. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=613.36s)]
*  Hot damn. Hot damn. And at no time in his life did Joe Biden ever support segregated schools in [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=615.9200000000001s)]
*  Delaware, contrary to what Kamala Harris told us during the Democratic debates last time. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=624.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris has forgotten all about that because it never happened. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=630.24s)]
*  And in Kamala Harris's case, there's a whole palette of identities to choose from. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  So here you have someone who is the daughter, technically or was, was identified at birth [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=638.24s)]
*  as the daughter of a Jamaican college professor and an Indian college professor who grew up [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se5T_X49EQA&t=643.1999999999999s)]
