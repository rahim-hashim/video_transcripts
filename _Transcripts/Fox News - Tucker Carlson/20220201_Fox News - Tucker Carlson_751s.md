# Tucker: Every powerful person in America is talking about this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's something we've noticed. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=3.24s)]
*  You may have noticed it too. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=4.24s)]
*  All of a sudden, pretty much every powerful person in the country is talking about something [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=5.96s)]
*  called democracy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=10.24s)]
*  Democracy! [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=11.48s)]
*  Our sacred democracy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=12.56s)]
*  You hear that word everywhere from the Atlantic to NPR to the New Yorker magazine and NBC [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=14.84s)]
*  News in between. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=19.64s)]
*  Democracy defines the year 2022 the way that Groovy defined 1968. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=21.92s)]
*  All the cool kids are saying it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=27.1s)]
*  Liz Cheney has decided her life's mission is now to defend democracy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=28.88s)]
*  Jim Acosta has a new CNN show in which he uses the word democracy the way some people [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=32.96s)]
*  use prepositions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=36.44s)]
*  In every sentence. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=37.72s)]
*  Tomorrow at 2pm eastern there's a Zoom webinar on democracy which you're welcome to attend [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=39.4s)]
*  in case you haven't heard enough about it already. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Every left of center midwit on Twitter will be there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  All of them will be fretting about the future of democracy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=49.04s)]
*  Pretty amusing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  It's easy to make fun of an event like that and of course you have a moral obligation [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  to. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=57.64s)]
*  Some blooviates about democracy and cert joke here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=58.64s)]
*  But actually if we're being honest about it you should be a little worried about the state [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=62.4s)]
*  of our democracy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=65.2s)]
*  How is our democracy doing? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=66.2s)]
*  Well let's see. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=68.76s)]
*  Another way to describe democracy is popular representation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=69.76s)]
*  That's a synonym. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=72.8s)]
*  When the government does what citizens want it to do you have a democracy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=74.16s)]
*  And when it doesn't you don't. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=78.56s)]
*  You no longer have a free country that is ruled by its people. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=80.4s)]
*  So what kind of system do we have? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=84.2s)]
*  You find out what citizens care about and then you compare those concerns to what the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=87.04s)]
*  people who run the government say they care about. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=90.56s)]
*  If you've got a functioning democracy there should be a fairly precise overlap. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  In a democratic system leaders try very hard to speak for their voters. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  That's the whole point of the government. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=101.56s)]
*  So let's apply that test to the United States of America. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  What do our leaders care about? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=107.2s)]
*  We know the answer because they tell us constantly. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=109.04s)]
*  Our leaders care about equity and climate change. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  They care about trans rights, police brutality, the deadly insurrection of January 6th, mandatory [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=113.46s)]
*  vaccinations, more H-1B visas for Indian tech workers, and above all at the moment defending [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=119.05999999999999s)]
*  our closest ally Ukraine from Russian aggression. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  And of course they care about third wave academic feminism. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=128.18s)]
*  That's deeply important to them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=131.18s)]
*  Watch is the most famous Democrat in Congress gives us an impromptu tutorial on Instagram [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=133.42s)]
*  about the connection between cosmetics and the patriarchy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=138.1s)]
*  There are studies that show that women who wear makeup or regularly wear like a decent [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=142.34s)]
*  amount of makeup kind of show up to the office in glam also make more money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=148.34s)]
*  And so at that point it stops being these calculations and decisions stop being about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  choice and they start being about patriarchy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=160.26s)]
*  We live in systems that were largely built for the convenience of men and oftentimes [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=165.86s)]
*  were designed with the subjugation of women and queer people in mind. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  Give that lady an MSNBC show. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=180.78s)]
*  Sorry, Mika. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  I wear makeup because I'm oppressed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  Me me me me me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=188.22000000000003s)]
*  Now the shorthand description of that is narcissism, which in the end is the defining concern of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=190.10000000000002s)]
*  our leaders. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=194.58s)]
*  Of all they're interested in themselves. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=195.78s)]
*  If you work in the media or have multiple college degrees, chances are you're pretty [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=198.18s)]
*  good at making it all about you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=201.82s)]
*  You is what you care about most. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=204.34s)]
*  What does the rest of America care about? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  Once again, we don't have to guess about that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=209.7s)]
*  We've got a huge amount of public opinion polling on that subject and you're seeing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=210.94s)]
*  the results right now from a recent Gallup survey on your screen. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=214.14s)]
*  At the top of that list, you'll see government incompetence, the economy, the cost of living [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=217.66s)]
*  and immigration. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=221.7s)]
*  Well, that's weird. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=222.7s)]
*  This looks completely different from the list that Joe Biden might have made. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=224.88s)]
*  Equity, climate change, transgenderism, mandatory vaxes, January 6th, Ukraine. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=229.28s)]
*  Those trends be pretty unimportant to most Americans. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=235.84s)]
*  In fact, some of those issues are at the very bottom of the list. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=238.44s)]
*  But how can that be? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=242.72s)]
*  If global climate change is the most imminent existential crisis of our time, then why don't [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=244.44s)]
*  voters seem concerned about it? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=249.32s)]
*  We don't know, but they're definitely not concerned about it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=252.4s)]
*  Instead, Americans are very worried about inflation and crime. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=255.44s)]
*  As it happens, and this tells you everything, those are the two topics the White House has [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  dismissed recently as irrelevant and dumb. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=263.2s)]
*  The White House isn't at all worried about inflation and crime. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=266.58s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=270.44s)]
*  That doesn't sound like democracy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=271.48s)]
*  Here's the White House press secretary taking some time off from her junior year at Oberlin [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=274.0s)]
*  to speak to her fellow undergrads at something called Pod Save America about how rising [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=278.24s)]
*  crime rates are actually an invention of those racists at Fox News. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=282.64s)]
*  Right now, just to give you a sense, so CNN, Pentagon, as many as 8,500 US troops on heightened [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=288.0s)]
*  alert, okay, true. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=293.12s)]
*  Same on MSNBC. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  CNBC is doing their own thing about the market. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  And then on Fox is Jeanine Pirro talking about soft on crime consequences. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=299.12s)]
*  I mean, what does that even mean, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=303.44s)]
*  So there's an alternate universe on some coverage. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=307.24s)]
*  What's scary about it is a lot of people watch that and they think that the president isn't [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=311.6s)]
*  doing anything to address people's safety. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=316.68s)]
*  So what are your kids getting shot have to do with Ukraine? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=320.88s)]
*  Nothing Dumbo. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=324.36s)]
*  You're living in an alternate universe. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=325.44s)]
*  That's Jen Psaki's position. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=328.44s)]
*  You'd have to be delusional to think crime was a problem in this country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=329.44s)]
*  Unless you happened to be in Georgetown last night around 6 45 p.m. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=332.96s)]
*  If you were there, you may have seen a man shot to death outside Georgetown cupcakes. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=336.23999999999995s)]
*  That's just off M Street. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=340.28s)]
*  And the funny thing is that's not too far from where Jen Psaki lives. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=341.82s)]
*  But did Jen Psaki acknowledge that happened? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=345.56s)]
*  Of course she didn't. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=347.68s)]
*  Noticing the collapse of your civilization is racist even when it's happening just down [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  the street. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  Look away, Jen Psaki, look away. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  And whatever you do, don't go to Baltimore. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=356.52s)]
*  Baltimore is a major American city. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=359.64s)]
*  It's only about 40 miles from where Jen Psaki lives. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=361.44s)]
*  It's one of the worst places in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=364.48s)]
*  It's a little bit of Haiti in the mid Atlantic. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Baltimore is exactly what happens when you apply Jen Psaki's ideas to governing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=369.56s)]
*  Baltimore is a city run by people who fervently believe in the equity agenda and consider [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=374.6s)]
*  gender studies a legitimate academic discipline. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=378.42s)]
*  In Baltimore, pretty much everyone in charge is black. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=381.68s)]
*  Yet it's a matter of religious faith that the main thing holding the city back is white [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=384.08s)]
*  racism. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=387.64s)]
*  In other words, everybody with power in Baltimore agrees with Jen Psaki. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=388.84s)]
*  So it's an entirely fair question to ask. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=393.96s)]
*  Hey, Jen Psaki, what do you think of Baltimore? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=395.88s)]
*  How did the city get that way? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=399.08s)]
*  You claim to care so deeply about African Americans, you never stop talking about that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=401.3s)]
*  And yet here is one of the biggest black majority cities in the United States. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=405.56s)]
*  Tens of thousands of black people who live in Baltimore are in misery because their kids [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=409.88s)]
*  keep getting murdered. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=414.14s)]
*  Last year, Baltimore's murder rate was higher than it is in El Salvador and Honduras. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=416.52s)]
*  Now, those are countries the State Department tells us to, quote, avoid due to crime. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=419.84s)]
*  So it's fair to say things are incredibly violent in Baltimore. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=425.4s)]
*  They have been for a long time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=427.76s)]
*  And yet under Joe Biden, somehow they've gotten even worse in Baltimore. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=429.86s)]
*  Here's a local news report from today. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=434.2s)]
*  The hugging and crying. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=437.12s)]
*  Thousands of sorrow, outpouring of emotions over the killing of a loved one. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=441.44s)]
*  Thirty-six homicides in the first month this year in Baltimore City, with only two arrests, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=446.0s)]
*  one for a deadly shooting, the other a stabbing death. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=452.44s)]
*  Thirty-six murders in 31 days. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=457.44s)]
*  That's the deadliest January in Baltimore in nearly 50 years. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=459.96s)]
*  And remember, 50 years ago, Baltimore was almost twice as big as it is now. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=463.92s)]
*  Half the city's left. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=468.6s)]
*  So Baltimore is far worse off than it has ever been in its history. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=470.0s)]
*  And it's not just murders. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=473.44s)]
*  Drug crimes are up dramatically. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=474.76s)]
*  You might not know that because they're not being prosecuted anymore. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=475.76s)]
*  Last spring, the local city attorney, a George Soros puppet called Marilyn Mosby, announced [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=479.64s)]
*  she would no longer prosecute low-level drug crimes. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=483.88s)]
*  So arrests plummeted. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=487.22s)]
*  But drug trafficking exploded. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=489.18s)]
*  Here's what it looks like. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=491.6s)]
*  Gar cameras caught what appears to be one of those open-air drug deals happening in [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=493.28s)]
*  near the Edmondson Village shopping center. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=498.72s)]
*  It's an issue we've been hearing about in neighborhoods citywide throughout the summer. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=500.76000000000005s)]
*  It comes after city state's attorney Marilyn Mosby stopped prosecuting certain drug crimes [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=506.16s)]
*  in the city, including drug possession. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=510.92s)]
*  Major policy shift that some believe have left the issue to only flourish. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=513.96s)]
*  Jen Psaki's for that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=521.0s)]
*  Black people don't want laws to be enforced. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=522.12s)]
*  That's her view. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=524.9200000000001s)]
*  That's the view of everyone she knows. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=526.16s)]
*  But what did policies like that do to Baltimore? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=528.36s)]
*  Well, they turned a once-beautiful city into a slum. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=530.5999999999999s)]
*  According to a report by Fox 45 in Baltimore, public school administrators have instructed [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=534.0s)]
*  the police to stop arresting students for committing crimes. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=538.14s)]
*  And that would include serious offenses from burglary to assault. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  So the cops did stop arresting kids. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  The number of students arrested in Baltimore schools has dropped by 98 percent in the last [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=546.8s)]
*  decade. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=551.76s)]
*  That's good on paper. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=552.76s)]
*  But it turns out ignoring crime is not the same as stopping crime. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=553.92s)]
*  Schools in Baltimore got so bad that kids stopped learning anything. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=558.16s)]
*  Watch this report and ask yourself, what is Baltimore going to look like in 20 years? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=562.64s)]
*  In reading, 628 Patterson High School students took the test. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=568.64s)]
*  484 of them, or 77 percent, tested at an elementary school reading level. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=573.8s)]
*  That includes 71 high school students who are reading at a kindergarten level and 88 [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=582.08s)]
*  students reading at a first grade level. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=589.84s)]
*  Another 45 are reading at a second grade level. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  Just 12 students tested at Patterson High School were reading at grade level. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=596.64s)]
*  That comes out to less than 2 percent. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=602.64s)]
*  So the kids can't read. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=607.7800000000001s)]
*  They're illiterate. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=609.0s)]
*  What does their future look like? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=610.08s)]
*  What does Baltimore's future look like? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=611.68s)]
*  What does the country's future look like? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=613.28s)]
*  How are they going to participate in our society? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=614.88s)]
*  You wouldn't know any of this was happening by looking at the official graduation numbers [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=617.88s)]
*  because last year Baltimore announced that students will graduate from high school even [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=620.88s)]
*  if they fail their courses. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=625.04s)]
*  Baltimore's so-called chief academic officer, that would be a Harvard educated bureaucrat [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=627.4s)]
*  called Joan Dabrowski, announced that this policy was designed to quote, avoid the punitive [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=631.4799999999999s)]
*  approach of failing students. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=636.56s)]
*  Okay, but somebody is failing students in Baltimore. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=639.12s)]
*  Somebody in fact is failing the entire city. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  And you have to ask yourself, who would that be? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=645.28s)]
*  You'd like to ask Jen Psaki, who do you blame for Baltimore? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=648.36s)]
*  Did white men do this to Baltimore? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=651.4s)]
*  Was it the patriarchy? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=653.26s)]
*  Was it structural racism that caused all those murders? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=654.88s)]
*  Do you agree with Pete Buttigieg that Klansmen urban planners put the highways in the wrong [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  place? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=662.88s)]
*  And that's the real problem, racist roads. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=663.88s)]
*  Or could it be that the real problem with Baltimore is something much more obvious? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=666.84s)]
*  Could it be that progressive policies designed to quote, lift up marginalized communities, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=671.4s)]
*  in the end, destroyed those communities? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=676.24s)]
*  What's the answer, Jen Psaki? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=678.6800000000001s)]
*  In a functioning democracy, people like Jen Psaki would have to tell us the answer. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=681.1600000000001s)]
*  They would be required to live in Baltimore until they learn something. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=685.44s)]
*  Just as the people who wrecked Afghanistan probably ought to explain what they've learned [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=689.6s)]
*  before they move on to Ukraine and Russia. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=693.12s)]
*  That ought to be a requirement. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=695.2s)]
*  And in fact, honestly, you'd think that people like this would welcome a chance to reflect [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=696.88s)]
*  on what they've done. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=700.4000000000001s)]
*  They have screwed up very badly. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  They've hurt the weakest among us. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=703.32s)]
*  For Christians, that's the greatest sin. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=705.1s)]
*  But these people aren't Christians. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  They worship only themselves. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=708.6s)]
*  So they turn away. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=710.4000000000001s)]
*  You can bet money that Jen Psaki rarely goes to Baltimore. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=712.1600000000001s)]
*  It's just too depressing and it raises too many questions. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  Instead, Jen Psaki and her friends are planning their fun little summer trips to Bozeman or [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=717.84s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard or East Hampton or some other remote and blindingly white outpost [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=722.1s)]
*  of privilege. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=726.5s)]
*  Funny how that works. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=727.74s)]
*  You wreck stuff and then you ignore it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=729.1800000000001s)]
*  This allows you to wreck more stuff without feeling guilty. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=731.88s)]
*  That's modern progressivism distilled to 18 words. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSk9BQ2IZGY&t=735.74s)]
