# 'Atheists love' this term: Kanye West
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0)
*  We told you at the top you'd be able to assess for yourself [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=0.0s)]
*  whether West is crazy, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  as virtually every single media outlet on planet Earth [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=5.24s)]
*  claims every day, all year long. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  Is he crazy? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=12.88s)]
*  As you try to assess that, ask, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=14.8s)]
*  is what you just heard over the past 40 minutes [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=16.76s)]
*  any crazier than what you see on television every day? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=20.44s)]
*  The lies, the lunacy presented to you with a straight face? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=24.52s)]
*  As reality? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=28.12s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=29.52s)]
*  It's not crazy at all. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  He's a big thinker though. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=31.84s)]
*  We asked him about 2024 and what he plans to do [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=32.78s)]
*  and also about Elon Musk. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=37.0s)]
*  People with power try to make other people feel [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=39.64s)]
*  like they don't have any. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=42.08s)]
*  My power is through God. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=45.52s)]
*  So if someone ever says anything like, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=48.1s)]
*  oh, you did a great job, it's praise God. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=49.96s)]
*  It's funny, atheists love the term narcissist [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=52.36s)]
*  when you believe in yourself. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=57.64s)]
*  They say that it's narcissistic. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=60.24s)]
*  I love the way, I love the dynamic of how you compare, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=64.84s)]
*  you show that there's still humanity [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=73.72s)]
*  even with the position that God has placed me in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=79.48s)]
*  Why did Moses smite the rock? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=83.4s)]
*  Why do you get that frustrated? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=86.24s)]
*  And just to be able to be gentle, to be more gentle. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=90.2s)]
*  God is alive. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Look at this right here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=100.94s)]
*  Look at how quiet it is right now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=102.68s)]
*  It's only God, God is of order. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=105.24s)]
*  The devil is of chaos. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=107.2s)]
*  That's true. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=109.4s)]
*  I wanna talk about my potential future. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=113.68s)]
*  I think that I'm gonna talk about my potential run [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=119.4s)]
*  for 2024 and Trump's potential run for 2024 [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  and the beloved DeSantis potential run for 2024 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=127.28s)]
*  and Mayor Suarez potential run for 2024. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=130.88s)]
*  And you know, I thought Trump was a joke. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=135.16s)]
*  For older white people, they're quick to classify [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=141.48s)]
*  by the fact that we're black. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=146.92s)]
*  Even Trump, a person that's, you know, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=148.98s)]
*  we'd consider to be a friend of mine. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  When I went to the White House, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=154.48s)]
*  I called him after that to get Asap Rocky out of jail. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=157.44s)]
*  And one of the things he said to me is, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=163.82s)]
*  you know, Kanye, you're my friend. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=166.2s)]
*  When you came to the White House, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=167.76s)]
*  my black approval rating went up 40%. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=169.44s)]
*  And for politicians, all black people are worth [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=174.16s)]
*  as an approval rating. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=182.84s)]
*  The Democrats feel that they don't owe us anything [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=186.68s)]
*  and Republicans feel that they don't owe us anything. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=191.72s)]
*  Blacks have never demanded something for our vote. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=197.22s)]
*  And that's something I talked to Ice Cube about. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=202.62s)]
*  What are we asking for? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=205.62s)]
*  How do we change our life? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=207.02s)]
*  If all of our organizations and all of our colleges [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=208.74s)]
*  and even our title as black was made by white people, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=212.24s)]
*  all of our, you know, all of our jobs [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=214.66s)]
*  and black Wall Street, Harlem after gentrification, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  there's never been a fully black-owned community [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=226.14s)]
*  where we have all the municipalities, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  things that Dr. Claude Anderson talks about. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=232.72s)]
*  We need that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=237.48s)]
*  It's like 90% of America is not even developed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=238.48s)]
*  I'm not one of the people that go up and say, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=244.0s)]
*  hey, I wanna stop anybody from making money. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=247.12s)]
*  The people that make money and the powers that be, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=249.84s)]
*  I am your true Nikolai Tesla. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=253.16s)]
*  And I'm not even a scientist. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=256.84s)]
*  What do you think of Elon Musk? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=261.96s)]
*  Do you know him? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  Very well. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=264.24s)]
*  What's your take on him? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=266.88s)]
*  You said that because I said Tesla? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=268.68s)]
*  I did, yeah, it's the first thing that popped up. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=270.24s)]
*  And that everyone's always like, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=272.08s)]
*  oh, Elon's got these answers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=273.24s)]
*  I think he's a great, I think he's a great team player. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvASNmTynk0&t=274.84000000000003s)]
