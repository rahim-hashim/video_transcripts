# Tucker Carlson: This is terrifying
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's 10 Happy Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=0.0s)]
*  Way back in the summer of 2016, a phenomenon appeared in several political polls that nobody [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=2.64s)]
*  in the American media could explain. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=8.68s)]
*  Donald Trump seemed to be performing exceptionally well among Hispanic voters in Florida. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=10.72s)]
*  It was bizarre. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=16.28s)]
*  So bizarre that everyone knew it could not be happening. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  It was scientifically impossible. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=19.84s)]
*  If there's one thing that every reporter in America understood, it was that Donald Trump [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=21.94s)]
*  hated Hispanics, like the devil hates holy water. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=25.8s)]
*  Some believe Trump was planning a national ban on picante sauce. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=28.76s)]
*  That's how deep and implacable his hatred was. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  And yet, according to what journalists refer to as the data, actual Hispanics seem to like [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=35.36s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  Cognitive dissonance is the term that describes what happened next. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=41.64s)]
*  How could the numbers show something that couldn't be happening? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=45.06s)]
*  So the Miami Herald looked into it and their conclusion was fairly straightforward. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=48.6s)]
*  Hispanic voters in Florida were mentally ill and also evil. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=52.0s)]
*  As one Miami Herald columnist put it, quote, Donald Trump's Cuban American followers suffer [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=56.68s)]
*  from Cuban supremacy syndrome. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=60.32s)]
*  It's an old national ailment of the soul. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=63.16s)]
*  So that was a diagnosis, something called Cuban supremacy syndrome, a serious but previously [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=66.2s)]
*  unknown medical condition like ADHD or long COVID. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=69.98s)]
*  Someone had better call a doctor. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=73.84s)]
*  This could be fatal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=74.84s)]
*  But before the medical establishment could intervene to save Hispanic voters from themselves, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=76.56s)]
*  this ailment spread like the virus it was, first from Florida, then to Texas, and then [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=81.32s)]
*  across the country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=86.12s)]
*  By 2020, it was endemic. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=88.12s)]
*  In the presidential election that year, Donald Trump, the guy who wanted to build a wall, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  became the first Republican in history to win Zapata County, Texas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=94.8s)]
*  Zapata County, Texas is approximately 94% Hispanic, 94%. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=98.36s)]
*  And he won. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=103.64s)]
*  For the Democratic Party, this was an emergency, made worse by the fact that there were no [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=104.64s)]
*  Cubans in Zapata County, Texas. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=110.0s)]
*  It's pretty much all Mexican Americans. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  So Cuban supremacy syndrome could not be the cause of it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=113.56s)]
*  And that's when a man called Eduardo Gamara came to the rescue. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=118.04s)]
*  Now, Gamara is a Blue-eyed college professor from Florida who has somehow convinced news [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  organizations that he is the world's authority on what recently arrived poor people from [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=125.04s)]
*  Central America really think. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=129.68s)]
*  And he had a new diagnosis. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=131.16s)]
*  Gamara, NBC News reported, found a, quote, casual link between misinformation and disinformation [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=133.44s)]
*  and how Spanish speakers have voted in recent elections. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  Of course, it was obvious Putin did it, just like Putin caused inflation and monkeypox [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=143.8s)]
*  and that war in Europe. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=148.36s)]
*  According to Professor Gamara, Hispanic voters were just too stupid to realize what was going [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  on. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=154.52s)]
*  They had no idea they were being fooled. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=155.52s)]
*  They're just too dumb. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=156.52s)]
*  To Democrats, this explanation made perfect sense. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  And they bought it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  A survey last month from WPA Intelligence found that more than half of CNN and MSNBC [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=163.12s)]
*  viewers now believe that, quote, disinformation is compelling Hispanic voters to vote Republican. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  Here's NBC, quote, News. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  It's a phenomenon that's having real world effects. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=177.84s)]
*  In Florida, 40% of Cuban Americans say they don't believe President Joe Biden was legitimately [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=181.0s)]
*  elected. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=186.4s)]
*  And given that Latinos spend more time on social media than their non-Hispanic white [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=187.52s)]
*  counterparts, it's a problem that's not going away. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=191.76s)]
*  But it's not just happening in Florida. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=195.88s)]
*  In Texas, Democratic strategists are sounding the alarm about a wave of misinformation aimed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  at Latinos heading into 2022. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  Did you hear that? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  Democratic strategists are sounding the alarm that Latinos spend so much time staring glassy [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=209.72s)]
*  eyed at their phones that they now have questions about the fairness of the last election. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  How to fix this? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=220.2s)]
*  Obviously, we're going to need a lot more censorship to keep this disinformation away [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=221.2s)]
*  from all those gullible Latinos. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=225.1s)]
*  Someone get Mark Zuckerberg on the phone immediately. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=227.46s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=231.14s)]
*  The bad news about the Democratic Party, obviously, is that it has become authoritarian. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=232.88s)]
*  The good news is it remains ridiculous. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=236.7s)]
*  These are people who believe their own improbable propaganda. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=238.94s)]
*  That's not the real explanation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=243.66s)]
*  So what is the answer? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=245.9s)]
*  Why exactly are Hispanic voters moving to the right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=247.7s)]
*  They definitely are. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=250.54s)]
*  The latest Fox News polling shows that 72% of Hispanic voters are not satisfied with [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=251.54s)]
*  the direction that Democrats are taking in the United States. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=255.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=258.78s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=260.09999999999997s)]
*  What problem do Latino voters have with the Democratic Party? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, the answer might be as obvious as it seems. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=266.06s)]
*  They just don't like what we've got now. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=268.14s)]
*  It is entirely possible that, like all normal people, Hispanic voters have come to despise [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=270.5s)]
*  the entitled urban liberals who run everything. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  And why wouldn't they despise them? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=279.06s)]
*  Those people are absurd. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=280.38s)]
*  Not a single word they utter is sincere ever, and everything they touch turns to filth. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=281.94s)]
*  We can give you countless examples of this, but we're just going to pull one from today's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=287.1s)]
*  news. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=290.18s)]
*  Washington, DC Councilmember Breanne Nadeau has long promised to love and protect illegal [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=291.18s)]
*  aliens in Washington, DC. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=297.06s)]
*  And thanks to her and many like her in local government, the District of Columbia is now [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=298.58s)]
*  a, quote, sanctuary city. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=301.98s)]
*  That's how much they love illegal aliens. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=303.46s)]
*  Breanne Nadeau especially, she loves them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=305.9s)]
*  And yet the moment actual illegal aliens showed up in Washington, DC sent by the governor [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  of Texas, Breanne Nadeau became completely hysterical about it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=312.5s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=316.94s)]
*  It's been said, but it's worth reiterating, that the governors of Texas and Arizona have [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=317.94s)]
*  created this crisis. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=324.06s)]
*  And in many ways, the governors of Texas and Arizona have turned us into a border town. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=326.26s)]
*  They've turned us into a border town. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=335.06s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=337.02000000000004s)]
*  Why is that bad? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=338.02s)]
*  What's wrong with border towns? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=339.02s)]
*  Weren't you just telling us, Breanne Nadeau, how great border towns are? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=340.62s)]
*  So much diversity, so much strength. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=343.78s)]
*  But as it turns out, and this probably won't shock you, Breanne Nadeau didn't mean any [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=346.58s)]
*  of it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=350.82s)]
*  Breanne Nadeau doesn't want illegal aliens in her neighborhood any more than the overwhelmingly [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=351.82s)]
*  Hispanic voters of Zapata County, Texas want them in theirs. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=355.26s)]
*  So what would that make Breanne Nadeau? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, a disgusting little hypocrite. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=360.78s)]
*  You knew that already. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=362.68s)]
*  A lot of Hispanic voters are learning it now. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=363.68s)]
*  So there's that, the basic repulsiveness of Democratic Party leaders. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=366.3s)]
*  By the way, nearly all of whom are openly hostile to the historic Christianity of Latin [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=370.98s)]
*  America that a lot of immigrants still believe in. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=374.58s)]
*  But then there's also crime. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=377.62s)]
*  Crime's the big one. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=379.16s)]
*  It seems likely that more than any other issue, crime, the increase in crime in the United [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=380.16s)]
*  States is moving Hispanic voters to the right. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=383.7s)]
*  They see, as we all see, liberals aggressively encouraging crime. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=387.58000000000004s)]
*  Crime destroys their neighborhoods. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=391.5s)]
*  Crime destroys the lives of the weakest. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=392.98s)]
*  And these voters, like all voters, watched Nancy Pelosi call MS-13 children of God at [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=396.42s)]
*  the same moment that MSNBC, MS-13 rather, members were hacking Salvadoran immigrants [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=402.3s)]
*  to death with machetes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=408.58s)]
*  Remember when Pelosi said that? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=409.58s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=410.86s)]
*  We're all God's children. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=411.86s)]
*  There's a spark of divinity in every person on earth. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=413.9s)]
*  And so when the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, these [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=417.38s)]
*  aren't people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=422.42s)]
*  These are animals. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=423.92s)]
*  You have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=426.92s)]
*  of every person? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=432.8s)]
*  So they watched someone who clearly doesn't actually believe in God invoke God repeatedly [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=436.3s)]
*  to defend something that's completely indefensible. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=441.06s)]
*  Just a year before Pelosi's heartfelt tribute to MS-13, an MS-13 gang member stabbed a man [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=444.70000000000005s)]
*  outside Washington more than 100 times and then beheaded him and ripped out his heart. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=449.90000000000003s)]
*  That was a child of God? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=453.84s)]
*  No, Trump was right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=454.84s)]
*  That was an animal. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=455.84s)]
*  Hispanic voters can see that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=457.84s)]
*  Most of them did not go to Yale Law School to their great credit. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=459.23999999999995s)]
*  Just days ago, a man called Jose Rafael Solano Landeta beheaded a mother on the street in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=462.76s)]
*  Silicon Valley. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=468.84s)]
*  Her two young children watched as he murdered her. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=469.84s)]
*  Now, who was this man? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=472.44s)]
*  We reached out to San Mateo County Sheriff's Office officials to learn more about him. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=474.44s)]
*  We asked, was he here in the country illegally? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=477.88s)]
*  And here's the response that we got. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=480.0s)]
*  Quote, I'm sorry, I'm not able to share that information. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=481.48s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=484.62s)]
*  Well, we can guess why. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=485.62s)]
*  Because of course, there's a very high chance that this man was in the country illegally. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=486.62s)]
*  And not by accident. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=490.5s)]
*  Democrats have suspended border enforcement to win the love of Hispanic voters. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=492.38s)]
*  What they apparently did not realize because they're not super bright is that Hispanic [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=496.94s)]
*  voters don't want violent lunatics in their neighborhoods either. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=500.06s)]
*  They're not into beheading people. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  Who knew? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=504.54s)]
*  And there's one other factor that may be moving this large and centrally important [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=506.74s)]
*  group of voters to the right. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=511.52s)]
*  People whose families have immigrated from the third world may be more sensitive than [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=513.96s)]
*  most to the importance of the rule of law. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=517.52s)]
*  The rule of law is the one thing that America has always had that the rest of the world [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=520.74s)]
*  has not. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=524.2s)]
*  That's why people come here. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=525.2s)]
*  And most immigrants consider it important still. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=526.2s)]
*  Liberals do not consider it important. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=528.48s)]
*  They're working to end it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=530.24s)]
*  Equal protection under the law is disappearing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=531.4s)]
*  At every level of American life, liberals apply an obvious double standard. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=534.0s)]
*  And that double standard is based on race. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=537.9s)]
*  That would be matters of education and employment, obviously, but also matters of law enforcement [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=539.66s)]
*  and criminal justice. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=544.34s)]
*  Liberals put up with certain behavior from some people that they would never accept in [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=545.94s)]
*  other people. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=549.6s)]
*  That is the definition of unfairness, which you see it every single day. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=551.1s)]
*  Remember the arrest of that Dominican bodega owner in New York? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=556.02s)]
*  The guy who was violently assaulted by a man whose girlfriend had tried to rob the store? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=559.34s)]
*  The bodega owner tried to defend himself and he stabbed his attacker, as most people would. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=563.68s)]
*  Authorities in New York charged that man with murder and sent him to jail. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=570.8399999999999s)]
*  And everyone could tell this was a double standard. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=574.28s)]
*  Would an elderly black bodega owner have been arrested for stabbing a Dominican attacker? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  Obviously not. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=581.14s)]
*  No one said it, but everyone saw it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=582.26s)]
*  And everyone understood the unfairness of that, including Hispanic voters. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=584.56s)]
*  Why would they like it? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=588.48s)]
*  If they wanted to live in a deeply unfair society, they would have stayed in the countries [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=590.32s)]
*  their ancestors came from. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=593.98s)]
*  But they came here because it's a fair society. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=595.34s)]
*  That's the main appeal of America. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=597.98s)]
*  Not a robust economy, but the fact that we're all equal under the law. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=599.58s)]
*  That's the one thing other countries don't have, and we do or did. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=603.3000000000001s)]
*  So this is a double standard. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=608.7800000000001s)]
*  And everyone sees it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=610.0s)]
*  And it's not just the level of bodega owners. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=612.2600000000001s)]
*  It goes to the very top of the Democratic Party, to its top candidates. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=614.08s)]
*  In South Carolina, for example, Democrats have nominated a Senate candidate, U.S. Senate, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=618.72s)]
*  called Crystal Matthews. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=623.1600000000001s)]
*  Crystal Matthews was caught on tape recently by James O'Keefe's group, Project Veritas, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=624.96s)]
*  openly advocating for punishing people because they're the wrong skin color. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=630.48s)]
*  Not exaggerating it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=635.08s)]
*  Here's the tape. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=636.08s)]
*  My district is heavily Republican, and it's heavily white. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=637.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=640.08s)]
*  I'm not a stranger to white people. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=641.08s)]
*  I'm a mostly white town. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=642.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=643.08s)]
*  Let me tell you one thing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=644.08s)]
*  You gotta know who you need to know. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=645.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=646.08s)]
*  You gotta treat them like s***. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=647.46s)]
*  That's the only way they'll respect you. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=650.46s)]
*  Gotta hurt white people, or they won't respect you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=653.6600000000001s)]
*  She said that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=655.98s)]
*  That video's real. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=656.98s)]
*  And yet somehow, no one seems to have noticed. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=657.98s)]
*  Crystal Matthews is not on the front page of the New York Times this morning. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=661.46s)]
*  There was no Justice Department investigation into her. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=663.46s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=667.34s)]
*  And everyone knows it's weird. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=668.34s)]
*  But it's hardly the only shocking news story that's not being covered as a news story. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=670.46s)]
*  Also missing from mainstream coverage is this video from Memphis of a young criminal promising [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=674.94s)]
*  to murder white people because of their skin color. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=679.72s)]
*  See, y'all ready to shoot a white old man. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=681.72s)]
*  I'm gonna shoot a white old lady s***. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=684.4000000000001s)]
*  Wild gray kids in the car. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=687.12s)]
*  So that video was recorded just a day after the rampage, the murder rampage in the same [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=690.9200000000001s)]
*  city, Memphis, committed by a felon called Ezekiel Kelly. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=695.32s)]
*  Ezekiel Kelly, like so many people who've committed murder recently, was let out of [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=698.96s)]
*  jail early. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=703.0s)]
*  But no one in charge in the Democratic Party in Memphis seemed bothered by that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=705.22s)]
*  In fact, while he was killing people, a state representative in Tennessee, a Democrat called [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=708.62s)]
*  Antonio Parkinson, complained that the real problem was police might hurt Ezekiel Kelly. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=713.66s)]
*  That was his main concern. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=719.38s)]
*  Quote, this is unbelievable. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=720.86s)]
*  Ezekiel Kelly will probably be killed tonight at the hands of police. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=722.66s)]
*  We are losing our children, he wrote. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=726.18s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=729.1s)]
*  That's your concern? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=730.28s)]
*  So in all three of these stories we've just reminded you of, the bodega owner in New York, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=733.16s)]
*  Crystal Matthews in South Carolina, the anti-white violence in Memphis, no one's noticing. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=737.16s)]
*  Joe Biden's DOJ is standing back and doing nothing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=742.4799999999999s)]
*  In other words, they're allowing violent race hate to flourish in the United States at the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=744.8s)]
*  same time they're telling you white supremacy is the biggest threat we face. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=748.4s)]
*  This is terrifying on many levels, but above all, once again, it is an attack not on any [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=752.04s)]
*  specific ethnic group, but on a principle that protects all of us, and that's the principle [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=756.98s)]
*  of equal justice under the law. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=761.24s)]
*  If you move to the United States from Latin America hoping to live under a fair justice [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=764.12s)]
*  system, this might bother you, and a lot of people are bothered. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=767.9200000000001s)]
*  They didn't want to live in Honduras, that's why they moved here. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  And yet no one in Washington on either side, the Democrats who are making this possible, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=776.32s)]
*  the Republicans who are still yammering on about criminal justice reform seem to understand [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=781.34s)]
*  But you know who does understand? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=785.22s)]
*  Hispanic immigrants. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=786.22s)]
*  They understand it very well. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=787.22s)]
*  They see that it's not safe anywhere. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=788.22s)]
*  Anywhere. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=791.22s)]
*  Not just in the so-called bad neighborhoods, but in the so-called nice neighborhoods. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=792.9000000000001s)]
*  The ones they live in or want to live in. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=796.82s)]
*  This video is from Sunday. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=799.34s)]
*  It was taken in a Chicago suburb called Lakeview. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=800.34s)]
*  Three men attack a woman on the sidewalk in front of her home. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=803.7s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=807.26s)]
*  You see that? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=815.08s)]
*  That's not some scary neighborhood, a roll-em-up neighborhood. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=838.4200000000001s)]
*  That's the neighborhood you live in or you want to live in. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=841.58s)]
*  That's the neighborhood you picture when you think middle America. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=843.88s)]
*  It's a nice leafy neighborhood. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=846.24s)]
*  That could be your daughter attacked on the sidewalk in front of your house. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=848.08s)]
*  That's happening. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=852.34s)]
*  And it's going to get a lot worse if we don't pull back now, but they're not pulling back. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=853.44s)]
*  The Democratic Party is doubling down. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=857.34s)]
*  In January, police in the state of Illinois will be banned from removing trespassers from [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=860.4s)]
*  your property. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=864.76s)]
*  The Democrat-controlled legislature just passed that law. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=866.12s)]
*  Effectively, they have legalized home invasions. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=868.44s)]
*  And there will likely be many more of those because starting next year, the Safety Act [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=871.9s)]
*  just passed in Illinois will let violent felons out of jail with no bail. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=875.9s)]
*  Actual violent felons. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=883.34s)]
*  People who committed crimes like second-degree murder and arson and kidnapping. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=884.62s)]
*  What will happen then? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=890.48s)]
*  Well, I think we know because it's been tried in other places like New York City, where [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=891.48s)]
*  people are regularly shot, beaten, and robbed in public. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=896.24s)]
*  People who could not be held behind bars because Democrats decide that was mean. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=900.84s)]
*  They're worried about the criminals and not worried about you. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=905.5s)]
*  And once again, to restate, if you siloed Hispanic voters into this one specific group [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=908.36s)]
*  whose concerns are totally different from everyone else's, you're missing the thread. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=913.44s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=916.0600000000001s)]
*  Hispanic voters are like every other voter, every voter of every race. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=917.0600000000001s)]
*  They don't like crime and violence, but it's everywhere. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=921.26s)]
*  These clips are all from the last month. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=924.1800000000001s)]
*  People sitting outside suddenly scramble to get out of the way as one man pops out [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=927.38s)]
*  of the sunroof and another out of the passenger window. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=932.54s)]
*  They both start shooting. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=936.12s)]
*  And arrest is made in this brutal, cowardly sucker punch at the Kings Plaza Mall. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=937.68s)]
*  Police say 21-year-old Jaheem David is facing assault charges. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=942.2s)]
*  Surveillance video from the S-40 MTA bus caught the incident on August 13th. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=946.4s)]
*  It shows the suspect walking up to a 64-year-old victim who is sitting in that wheelchair. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=950.16s)]
*  The cops say he grabbed $250 from the man. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=956.62s)]
*  Man got into a dispute with some others at that location. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=959.14s)]
*  One of them hit him with a baseball bat and another punched him in the face. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=962.0600000000001s)]
*  Surveillance video caught them as they went up to a 28-year-old victim and her friend. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=966.1s)]
*  The two were walking on the sidewalk when the duo went up to them and tried to grab, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=971.58s)]
*  according to detectives, the victim's necklace from her neck. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=976.02s)]
*  Police say the trio rode onto the sidewalk and the passengers from the dirt bike jumped [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=980.58s)]
*  off and forcibly removed a Rolex watch from the victim's wrist. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=984.84s)]
*  Now, what country is this? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=989.88s)]
*  It didn't used to be America. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=992.1600000000001s)]
*  This is not organic. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=993.5200000000001s)]
*  We didn't used to live like this. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  Liberals did this. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  They did this on purpose. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=997.7600000000001s)]
*  They created more crime. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=998.9200000000001s)]
*  It didn't just happen. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1000.36s)]
*  And the numbers couldn't be clearer on that. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1001.5200000000001s)]
*  Any Republican running for office this cycle, which is to say the month after next, who [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1004.24s)]
*  isn't running on this is an idiot because everyone knows it's happening of all colors. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1009.2s)]
*  Just today, local media in New York reported that a 21-year-old tourist was kidnapped and [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1015.0400000000001s)]
*  raped on a subway platform by a stranger. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1018.44s)]
*  Are you shocked by that? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1021.0400000000001s)]
*  You shouldn't be. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1022.1600000000001s)]
*  That's what happens when you stop enforcing the law. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1023.1600000000001s)]
*  That's what happens when you put the interests of criminals above those of citizens. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1024.8s)]
*  Everyone can see what's happening no matter what color they are. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1030.54s)]
*  Democrats should not be surprised when they're punished for this. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVKRjlkssU&t=1032.88s)]
