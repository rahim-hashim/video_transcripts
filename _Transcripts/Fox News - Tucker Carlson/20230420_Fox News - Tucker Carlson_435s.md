# Tucker Carlson: Democrats know where the power is
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, say what you will about elected Democrats, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=2.54s)]
*  but they know where the power is. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=4.92s)]
*  They're like truffle pigs for power. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=7.72s)]
*  No matter how thick the forest is, they will find it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=10.72s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=13.24s)]
*  In his very first hours in office, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=14.3s)]
*  literally on inauguration day, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=16.48s)]
*  Joe Biden named a new head of the criminal division [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=18.48s)]
*  at the Justice Department. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Now Biden spent that same day, you will remember, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=22.72s)]
*  lecturing the rest of us about equity, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=25.44s)]
*  meaning that straight white men are bad. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=27.56s)]
*  And yet strangely, the person he chose for this job [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  was not a member of a racial or sexual minority. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=33.14s)]
*  He was instead a highly privileged straight white guy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  He was called Nick McQuaid. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=39.48s)]
*  Nick McQuaid went to private schools. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=41.36s)]
*  He rode at Wesleyan. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=43.0s)]
*  He went to Columbia for law school. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  He was definitely not oppressed, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=46.64s)]
*  but that did not matter to Joe Biden. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=48.14s)]
*  Some jobs are too important for affirmative action. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=50.08s)]
*  McQuaid's main qualification [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=54.08s)]
*  was being the former law partner [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=55.96s)]
*  of Hunter Biden's criminal attorney. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=57.68s)]
*  In December of 2020, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=60.2s)]
*  Hunter Biden hired a Latham and Watkins lawyer [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=61.56s)]
*  called Chris Clark to defend him [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=63.76s)]
*  against potential federal tax charges. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=65.88s)]
*  Just a month later, Hunter Biden's dad [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=68.32s)]
*  hired Chris Clark's partner, Nick McQuaid, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=71.36s)]
*  to oversee the agency [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=74.56s)]
*  that could bring those federal tax charges. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=75.76s)]
*  That seems like an obvious and glaring conflict, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=78.52s)]
*  but no, Nick McQuaid did not recuse himself [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=81.36s)]
*  from the Hunter Biden investigation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=84.92s)]
*  And so more than two years later, not surprisingly, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=87.28s)]
*  no charges have been brought against Hunter Biden. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=90.04s)]
*  And it's not for lack of evidence. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  For years now, the FBI has had possession [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=94.48s)]
*  of Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=97.0s)]
*  On that laptop, as you know, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=98.56s)]
*  is a detailed account of how the Biden family [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=100.72s)]
*  made millions of dollars from foreign governments [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  selling access to the US government through Joe Biden. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=107.2s)]
*  So the question is, among many, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  did Hunter Biden pay federal taxes on all of that dough? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=113.64s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=118.64s)]
*  This is a guy who left a crack pipe [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  and his driver's license in a rental car [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=122.52s)]
*  because he was too high to put them back into his pocket. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=125.16s)]
*  Did he pay all his federal taxes? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=128.72s)]
*  Let's just say Hunter Biden does not fit the profile [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=132.68s)]
*  of a faithful taxpayer. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=134.72s)]
*  But he is the president's son. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=137.56s)]
*  And that's why when he was asked [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  about the criminal investigation [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=141.0s)]
*  into his taxes two years ago, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=142.16s)]
*  he didn't seem that worried. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=144.04s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=145.6s)]
*  At the end of last year, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=146.76s)]
*  Biden acknowledged an ongoing investigation [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=148.2s)]
*  by federal authorities for potential tax law violations. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=151.2s)]
*  Is your legal team working on any kind of a plea deal? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=155.72s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=158.4s)]
*  I am absolutely certain that what we're doing is, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=159.24s)]
*  is being completely cooperative with whoever is asking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=161.72s)]
*  from any authority whatsoever. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=165.72s)]
*  The implication all through the campaign [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=169.4s)]
*  was that your efforts had somehow benefited [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=171.1s)]
*  your father financially. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  Have you ever given your father money [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=174.26s)]
*  from any of your business ventures? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=176.1s)]
*  No. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=178.34s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=179.18s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  Ever. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  Not a nickel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=181.7s)]
*  Not a nickel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=182.54s)]
*  Directly or indirectly? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=183.38s)]
*  Directly or indirectly. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=184.22s)]
*  Not a nickel ever, 100%. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=185.04s)]
*  No, never. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  Oh, you lie. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=189.82s)]
*  You lie. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  That was two years ago. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=192.34s)]
*  Weirdly, we haven't heard a lot [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=193.7s)]
*  about the federal tax investigation into Hunter Biden since. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  And that is strange if you think about it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=198.7s)]
*  since we now have tens of thousands of new IRS agents [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=200.26s)]
*  to enforce tax law. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=203.73999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, it wasn't that long ago [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=206.54s)]
*  that the Biden Justice Department, do you remember this? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=207.82s)]
*  Indicted Donald Trump's 75 year old accountant [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=210.62s)]
*  because he failed to declare the full value [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=214.26s)]
*  of his work vehicle. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=216.1s)]
*  Think he was in handcuffs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  But somehow these same enforcers of the law [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=219.78s)]
*  cannot be bothered to bring the Hunter Biden [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=223.1s)]
*  investigation to fruition. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=226.06s)]
*  Not when they have a laptop proving [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=228.14s)]
*  that he took millions from the government of China. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=230.04s)]
*  How does that work exactly? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Did he pay every dollar in federal taxes? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  Did he fully declare the value of his work vehicle [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  or of his crack? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=239.42s)]
*  What about the Russian hookers? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  By the way, at the same time, DOJ doesn't seem interested [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=243.72s)]
*  at all in the fact that Hunter Biden [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  lied on a federal gun form. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  Go ahead and try that yourself at home. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  It's a felony. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=251.26s)]
*  You'll go to jail. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=252.1s)]
*  But Hunter Biden is not in jail. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=254.32s)]
*  He's making art in his garden in LA. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=255.68s)]
*  Is what we're seeing what it looks like? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=260.16s)]
*  Well, we can finally answer that question. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=261.8s)]
*  Thanks to a career special agent at the IRS [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=264.20000000000005s)]
*  who's decided to blow the whistle [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=266.68s)]
*  on the corruption in the Biden administration. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=268.56s)]
*  This whistleblower has just informed Congress [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=272.22s)]
*  that he has proof that the Attorney General [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=274.12s)]
*  of the United States, Merrick Garland, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  lied under oath about the Hunter Biden investigation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  That's a felony. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=281.32000000000005s)]
*  So the Attorney General of the United States [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  committed a felony, according to this whistleblower, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=284.76s)]
*  who also says he has seen, quote, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=287.04s)]
*  preferential treatment and politics [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=289.28s)]

*  were designed to, quote, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=301.52s)]

*  you suspected all along, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=306.47999999999996s)]

*  Typical steps that a law enforcement investigator [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=332.3s)]
*  would take were compromised [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=335.42s)]
*  because of political considerations. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=337.53999999999996s)]

*  to support his allegations. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=352.7s)]
*  The things he's been through are very well documented [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=354.7s)]

*  Here was her non-response. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=391.18s)]
*  The president has always been clear during the campaign, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=393.46s)]
*  during his presidency, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=396.06s)]
*  that the Department of Justice should have independence. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=397.17999999999995s)]
*  They should not be politicized [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=399.78s)]
*  and they should be able to do their job independently, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=401.53999999999996s)]
*  essentially. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=406.22s)]
*  And so I'll leave it to them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=407.06s)]
*  I'll leave it to the Department of Justice [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=408.94000000000005s)]
*  to make their decision to do, to move forward [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=410.1s)]
*  with this particular case. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=413.54s)]
*  Her presence is designed to insult the country [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu1l-GI788E&t=416.5s)]
