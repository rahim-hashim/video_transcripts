# Reporter tells Tucker the White House is trying to ‘punish’ him
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo)
*  So we're living in an age where the worst seem to be on a perpetual ascendance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=0.0s)]
*  They become White House press secretary, the dumbest among us, and the best are crushed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=4.92s)]
*  And we believe Simon Attiba is one of the best. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=9.8s)]
*  He's one of the very few journalists in the White House briefing room who asks real questions. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=12.64s)]
*  He is the top reporter from Africa in Washington. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=17.6s)]
*  And for that, he's hated. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=21.2s)]
*  Kareem Jean-Pierre has been avoiding him for months. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=22.56s)]
*  Now, Simon Attiba has learned he's being booted from the White House Correspondence Association, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=25.28s)]
*  which controls access to the White House briefings. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=31.12s)]
*  Kind of shocking news. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=33.64s)]
*  Simon Attiba is with Today News Africa. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=34.64s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=35.84s)]
*  Simon, I'm sorry to hear this news. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=36.84s)]
*  I'm shocked by it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=38.52s)]
*  How can you be thrown out of the White House Correspondence Association? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=40.1s)]
*  On what grounds? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=43.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=44.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Dr. Kareem. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=45.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me on the show. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=46.0s)]
*  Thank you for releasing the videos of the January 6th that show that we didn't have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=51.44s)]
*  the full story. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=56.64s)]
*  And I just want to thank you personally for that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=57.64s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=60.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=61.08s)]
*  So the White House Correspondence Association has decided that I'm not worth it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=62.08s)]
*  I'm not supposed to be a member of the association. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=66.88s)]
*  They deny, they refuse to renew my membership. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=70.16s)]
*  They are trying to help the press secretary, Kareem Jean-Pierre, because when you do the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=73.56s)]
*  right thing, when you ask the right question, they try to silence you, they try to censor [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=77.96s)]
*  you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  And the only thing they are doing to me right now is trying to punish me for trying to be [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  a real journalist, for asking the question that the American people really care about. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=88.08s)]
*  And it's shameful, it's a disgrace. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  And the president of the White House Correspondence Association, Tamara Keat, who works for NPR, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=95.32s)]
*  a publicly funded media organization, should be ashamed of herself. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  So you, NPR's correspondent, its fake reporter, is colluding with the White House press secretary [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=108.0s)]
*  to throw the one guy in the room out who asks real questions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=115.48s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=120.76s)]
*  When you do the right thing, when you don't send questions in advance, Kareem Jean-Pierre, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  she's totally incompetent. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=126.64s)]
*  She can't even answer basic questions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=127.92s)]
*  She lies a lot. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  She's lied repeatedly about the classified document, about other things. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=131.84s)]
*  When you ask those questions, when you press for the truth, they silence you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=136.16s)]
*  I never believed that this could happen to me in the United States. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=140.68s)]
*  In Africa, when we look up to the U.S., we saw the beacon of light, the beacon of excellence, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=144.36s)]
*  the beacon of free speech. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=150.36s)]
*  But here I am, right in the White House, in the most powerful house in the world, being [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  censored, being punished by Tamara Keat of NPR, the WSCA, who are totally incompetent [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=158.68s)]
*  and colluding with the White House to punish someone who is doing the right thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=165.32s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=170.32s)]
*  The state broadcaster, NPR, is colluding with the state to shut down free speech. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=172.56s)]
*  I wonder if NPR's media correspondent will cover this story. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=176.32s)]
*  Simon Etiba, we are blessed by your presence on this show. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=179.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=182.2s)]
*  And I'm sorry. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKesX15Nwo&t=183.2s)]
