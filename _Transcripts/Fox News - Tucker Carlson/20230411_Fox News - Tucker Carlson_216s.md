# Tulsi Gabbard's warning: If this happens, we no longer have freedom
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg)
*  If the government were ever to digitize currency, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=0.0s)]
*  your freedoms would evaporate. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=3.04s)]
*  They could zero out your bank account [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=5.5s)]
*  and make you impoverished for being disobedient. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=7.44s)]
*  You would be a serf at best. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  And with that in mind, you should know [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=12.24s)]
*  that Central Bank Digital Currencies, CBDCs, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=13.58s)]
*  are about to become the norm in Europe. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=16.32s)]
*  The president of the European Central Bank, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Christine Lagarde, has just said that Europeans [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=19.66s)]
*  will not be able to use more than $1,000 in cash anymore. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=21.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=25.86s)]
*  Now we have in Europe this threshold. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=27.96s)]
*  Above 1,000 euros, you cannot pay cash. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=31.1s)]
*  If you do, you are on the gray market. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=34.56s)]
*  So you take your risk. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=36.94s)]
*  You get caught, you are fined, or you go in jail. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=38.24s)]
*  So you go to jail for spending your own money [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  if they don't control it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=46.34s)]
*  That's coming here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard has spoken out against it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=50.22s)]
*  She, of course, ran for president, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=51.58s)]
*  served in the House from Hawaii, and joins us now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=52.98s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=56.18s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=57.81999999999999s)]
*  This is so dystopian. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=59.019999999999996s)]
*  You'd hate to think it could ever come here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=61.059999999999995s)]
*  You think it might. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=62.62s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, this is just the latest effort [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=65.66s)]
*  by those in power in our country [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=68.1s)]
*  who are intent on undermining [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=70.36s)]
*  and taking away our own freedoms and liberties. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  This Central Bank Digital Currency [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=74.74s)]
*  is about government sanctioned surveillance and control. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=76.94s)]
*  It's about them being able to keep track [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=81.1s)]
*  of every single thing that we purchase, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=83.78s)]
*  whether it's a stick of gum or an automobile [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=85.28s)]
*  or anything in between. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=87.48s)]
*  And so if they have all this information and data, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=89.52s)]
*  which they will in this system, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=92.36s)]
*  then where does that lead? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=94.68s)]
*  It gives them the power to decide, okay, well, hey, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  we don't want to allow you to purchase certain things, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=98.7s)]
*  or we may deem it necessary to freeze your overall account. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=101.4s)]
*  This power and what they can do with it, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=107.4s)]
*  it's not something we have to imagine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=108.5s)]
*  We've already seen how Democrats in Congress, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=109.7s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren and others are pressuring [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=113.02000000000001s)]
*  credit card companies to code and keep track [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=114.42s)]
*  of any purchase that's made at a store that sells firearms. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=117.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=120.9s)]
*  So that these private companies can then say, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  hey, this person is purchasing, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=124.0s)]
*  I don't know what they deem is kind of the threshold, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  but they will then report that as suspicious activity [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  to law enforcement and then expect law enforcement [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=132.08s)]
*  to take action and go after the purchases, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=134.52s)]
*  legal purchases that a private person made. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=136.78s)]
*  So this all comes back to how you open this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=139.36s)]
*  Once we give up our economic autonomy, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=142.52s)]
*  we no longer have freedom. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  Once we allow someone else to control our wallet, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=146.9s)]
*  they then control our freedom. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  Do you think people understand what this means? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  It'll be sold as always as an effort to push back [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=157.44000000000003s)]
*  against terrorism or international financiers [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  or crime or whatever, but do people understand [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=164.28000000000003s)]
*  on a gut level what could be coming? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=166.72000000000003s)]
*  I don't think they do and it's understandable [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=169.84s)]
*  because if you listen to what the government is telling us, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=171.7s)]
*  like with all of these other things, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  whether it's the Patriot Act or the Restrict Act, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=176.48s)]
*  they're doing the very same thing with this saying, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  hey, this is for your own good. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=180.54s)]
*  This is for your convenience to make it easier [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=182.48s)]
*  for you to conduct transactions when in fact, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=184.62s)]
*  they are giving themselves all of the power, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=188.32s)]
*  taking it away from us, undermining our God given rights [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=191.22s)]
*  and freedoms in the constitution [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=193.82s)]
*  because they want to be able to control us. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=196.2s)]
*  They want to be able to control we the people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=199.56s)]
*  So nicely put. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=201.28s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard joining us tonight. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=202.26s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=203.26s)]
*  Thanks Tucker. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYQWx94ZBg&t=204.1s)]
