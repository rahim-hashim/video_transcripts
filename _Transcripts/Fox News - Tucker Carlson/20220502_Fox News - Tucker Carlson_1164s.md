# Tucker: This is why Democrats are taking us to war with Russia
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight here's a happy memory. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=2.16s)]
*  By breakfast, really even brunch, on election day 2016, virtually nobody in Washington, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  D.C. thought Donald Trump could win. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=9.84s)]
*  And they didn't think that because the entire press corps had been telling them for months [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  that Trump had, as they always put it, literally no chance, not even as an abstract theoretical [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  matter. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=20.36s)]
*  This wasn't actually a race. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=21.48s)]
*  In fact, come November 8th, you'll remember this, Donald Trump was going to be drowned [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=22.48s)]
*  by a towering blue tsunami and swept away forever along with the rest of the Republican [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=26.04s)]
*  Party, the collaborators anyway. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=29.7s)]
*  And polling numbers seemed to confirm that this was going to happen. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  And so, by the way, did the private betting markets. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=34.62s)]
*  At least one of those markets had set the spread at 80-20 for Hillary Clinton that morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  In the end, of course, they were only wrong. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=42.26s)]
*  They were hilariously wrong. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=43.62s)]
*  By midnight, Trump had won. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=44.94s)]
*  And a lot of highly educated, extremely well credentialed people suddenly looked ridiculous. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=46.26s)]
*  Hillary Clinton herself was so shocked by the results that night that she refused to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=52.14s)]
*  give a concession speech. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=55.86s)]
*  She went to bed hoping it was just a dream. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=57.82s)]
*  Now, you probably remember all of that very well, but it was what happened next in the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=59.9s)]
*  days between the election and Thanksgiving that it turns out in a lot of ways was much [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=64.86s)]
*  more important. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=69.34s)]
*  What happened during that period set the course for where we are right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=70.34s)]
*  Where we are right now is speeding toward one of the great disasters in our history. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=74.34s)]
*  So the leaders of the Democratic Party couldn't, in effect, handle the outcome of the 2016 [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=78.7s)]
*  election. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=83.34s)]
*  They snapped under the strain of it, under the crushed expectations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=84.34s)]
*  But rather than look inward and assess their own role in the disaster, what did we do [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=87.7s)]
*  wrong? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  Why did voters reject us? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  And other questions that emotionally mature adults might have asked. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  Democratic leaders instead immediately set out to find somebody else to blame for the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=99.3s)]
*  election results. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=103.06s)]
*  And soon they settled on Russia. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=104.9s)]
*  Vladimir Putin got Donald Trump elected, they told us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  Hillary Clinton said that repeatedly. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  Now, at first, it was hard to take any of it very seriously. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=111.98s)]
*  He tried, but there was no evidence it was true at all. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=115.86s)]
*  And so a rational person concluded the obvious. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=118.98s)]
*  This was a childish psychological defense mechanism. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=121.46s)]
*  It was not a factual claim. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=123.94s)]
*  And yet they kept saying it in the face of no evidence. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=126.58s)]
*  And over time, they began acting on it like it was true. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=129.46s)]
*  And then even over more time, they paralyzed the entire federal government for years fruitlessly [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=132.02s)]
*  trying to prove the core claims of Russiagate. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=136.42s)]
*  But they never could because those claims weren't true. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=139.18s)]
*  And yet, critically, they clung to those claims. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=141.62s)]
*  They never stopped repeating the talking point. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=144.5s)]
*  The Russian government, quote, hacked our election. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=146.94s)]
*  That was Jen Psaki not long ago saying it out loud like it were true. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=149.38s)]
*  Now, here's the context. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=153.02s)]
*  As she said that, Psaki was trying to explain why the Biden administration is in effect [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=154.9s)]
*  working to overthrow the Russian government right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=159.06s)]
*  And for once, Jen Psaki was telling the truth. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=162.18s)]
*  That is why. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=163.86s)]
*  Democrats have convinced themselves that Russia stole the presidency, which rightfully belonged [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=165.58s)]
*  to Hillary Clinton. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=170.2s)]
*  And they mean it when they say it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=171.2s)]
*  And that's why they are taking us to war with Russia. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=173.18s)]
*  Now there are a lot of things going on here, a lot of threads, as in any big story. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  But on some level, the core motivation is just that simple. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=179.82s)]
*  Here's we know it's not. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=183.78s)]
*  We know the war in Ukraine is not about saving democracy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=184.78s)]
*  Please. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  We know it's not about protecting the sacred borders of a sovereign country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=188.82s)]
*  We know the Biden administration doesn't care about those principles because they run our [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=192.74s)]
*  country and we see how they act. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=196.22s)]
*  And we know for dead certain, and this comes as sad news to a lot of Americans who are [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=199.06s)]
*  compassionate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=202.62s)]
*  But we know now that the war in Ukraine is certainly not about helping the Ukrainian [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=203.62s)]
*  people, those poor people. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=206.94000000000003s)]
*  Many more Ukrainian civilians will die, certainly thanks to the Biden administration's policies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=209.06s)]
*  If you wanted to save Ukraine, its people, its infrastructure, its nation, you would [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=214.78s)]
*  push for a settlement now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  You would have done it two months ago, but they're not doing that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  They've rejected it out of hand. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  So that's not their goal, saving Ukraine, saving human lives. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=225.06s)]
*  No, that's not their goal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=228.38000000000002s)]
*  Instead, the war in Ukraine is designed to cause regime change in Moscow. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=230.06s)]
*  They want to topple the Russian government. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=235.22s)]
*  That would be payback for the 2016 election. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  So this is the logical, maybe the inevitable end stage of Russiagate. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=240.1s)]
*  Now we should have seen this coming because they said it out loud years ago. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  Here's Adam Schiff from two years ago predicting it, saying it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=249.9s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=254.22s)]
*  As one witness put it during our impeachment inquiry. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=255.22s)]
*  The United States aids Ukraine and her people so that we can fight Russia over there and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=259.34s)]
*  we don't have to fight Russia here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=264.7s)]
*  So we arm Ukraine so we can fight Russia. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=267.9s)]
*  Now how many Americans, whatever you think of Putin, probably not much, justifiably, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=272.82s)]
*  probably don't have a lot of interest in moving to Russia, but how many Americans then or [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=276.53999999999996s)]
*  now want to quote, fight Russia? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=281.38s)]
*  A very small group. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=284.78s)]
*  But Adam Schiff said it out loud at the time in the House of Representatives. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=286.58s)]
*  We don't arm Ukraine so we can help the Ukrainians. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=290.5s)]
*  They're merely unfortunate pawns in all of this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=293.74s)]
*  We arm Ukraine so that we can punish Russia. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  For stealing Hillary Clinton's coronation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=299.97999999999996s)]
*  If only we had taken Adam Schiff seriously as he said it again and again and again. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=302.28s)]
*  But now we can't help but take Adam Schiff seriously because he's one of the prime movers [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=307.38s)]
*  of this war. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=310.62s)]
*  Adam Schiff spent this weekend in Eastern Europe checking on the progress of the war [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=312.02s)]
*  he has done so much to bring about. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=315.97999999999996s)]
*  He traveled there with Nancy Pelosi and a number of other of the most conspiracy-minded [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=317.9s)]
*  Democrats in Congress. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=322.4s)]
*  These are the Russiagate true believers seeing their theory come to fruition. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=323.78s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=328.38s)]
*  Here's the group, Pelosi, Schiff and the rest meeting with the President of Ukraine. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=329.94s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=345.9s)]
*  Thank you for reminding me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=346.9s)]
*  You know, it's the President. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=347.9s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=348.9s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=349.9s)]
*  Hi, Mr. President. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=350.9s)]
*  Jason Crow. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=351.9s)]
*  Adam Schiff from California. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=352.9s)]
*  You're very welcome. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=353.9s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=354.9s)]
*  So how did Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi wind up in charge of America's foreign policy as [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=355.9s)]
*  we stand on the cusp of a third world war? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=366.06s)]
*  And why are Republicans supporting them? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=370.32s)]
*  And what happens when you put people with a demonstrated lack of boundaries or self-control [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=373.06s)]
*  or wisdom in charge of something as important as the fate of nations? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=378.42s)]
*  Well, here's what happens. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=382.42s)]
*  Watch as one after the other, the Democrats you just saw on tape, announce that this regime [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=384.5s)]
*  change is not nearly over. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=389.38s)]
*  In fact, this war has just begun. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=392.26s)]
*  Well, one thing is really clear that this delegation, one of the Senate, but also President [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=393.26s)]
*  Biden has made very clear with his most recent aid package request. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=397.7s)]
*  It is a historic request that we're going to push hard in the United States Congress [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=402.26s)]
*  to help pass. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=407.34s)]
*  And it sends a very simple message. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=408.34s)]
*  We are not interested in stalemates. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=411.38s)]
*  We are not interested in going back to the status quo. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=414.3s)]
*  The United States of America is in this to win. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=417.53999999999996s)]
*  And we will stand with Ukraine until victory is won. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=420.53999999999996s)]
*  That was Congressman Jason Crow, a confirmed buffoon, telling us that we're not in it to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=425.58s)]
*  achieve a stalemate. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=432.3s)]
*  We're? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=433.85999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=434.85999999999996s)]
*  Some of us were under the impression based on their public statements that we were defending [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=435.85999999999996s)]
*  the sovereignty of another country, Ukraine, that it's not up to us. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  It's up to the voters of Ukraine because Ukraine's a democracy. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=442.7s)]
*  But here's Congressman Crow telling us we're not going to accept a, quote, stalemate. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=445.38s)]
*  We're in it to win it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=450.59999999999997s)]
*  We're going to win. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=452.44s)]
*  We're here till we get victory. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=453.44s)]
*  Well, that raises the obvious question. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=455.5s)]
*  What is winning? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  What is victory? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=458.41999999999996s)]
*  How do we know when we've won? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=459.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, Jason Crow didn't tell us. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=460.41999999999996s)]
*  And neither, by the way, did Nancy Pelosi. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=461.73999999999995s)]
*  She just said we're going to keep sending weapons to Ukraine, quote, until the fight [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=463.97999999999996s)]
*  is done. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  We believe that we are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom, that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=468.65999999999997s)]
*  we are on a frontier of freedom, and that your fight is a fight for everyone. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  And so our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=481.1s)]
*  How do we get here exactly? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=488.02000000000004s)]
*  Do you feel betrayed? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=490.3s)]
*  If you're one of the millions of good-hearted Americans who put a Ukrainian flag pin on [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=491.82000000000005s)]
*  your lapel or put one in front of your house expressing solidarity with the poor, oppressed [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=495.98s)]
*  people of Ukraine, you probably didn't think you were signing up for this. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=500.42s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi telling us we're in a war with a nuclear-armed power with no clear end date. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=503.85999999999996s)]
*  Seen that movie before? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=511.53999999999996s)]
*  Oh, we just finished one after 20 years in Afghanistan. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=512.54s)]
*  Well, it looked like that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=515.74s)]
*  This is an open-ended conflict, said Nancy Pelosi, just like the war on terror. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=517.78s)]
*  And just in case you missed it, they all repeated that line. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=522.62s)]
*  Here's your nightmare again. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=525.42s)]
*  Adam Schiff in charge of the war against Russia. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=526.62s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=529.86s)]
*  The whole freedom-loving world has an interest in the outcome of this war and ensuring that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=531.34s)]
*  Ukraine is victorious. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=536.5s)]
*  And we are determined to do everything in our power to make this happen. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=538.5s)]
*  We are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and we will until the 50th year's [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=542.5s)]
*  coming. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=547.5s)]
*  These people are playing dress-up. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=550.14s)]
*  They have no idea what they're talking about and they don't care. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=551.94s)]
*  They get to pretend to be statesmen for a day. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=554.94s)]
*  But when Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi, again, people with a demonstrated years-long record [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=557.4200000000001s)]
*  of being willing to say anything for personal power, anything to improve the fortunes of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=562.98s)]
*  their political party, when they're standing up with a foreign head of state saying, here's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=568.3000000000001s)]
*  an open check, you fill in the number, you've got to wonder where this is going. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  We know where it could go. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=578.58s)]
*  This is the most reckless foreign policy in our lifetimes, in American history. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=581.0s)]
*  You are watching a group of decadent, in some cases senile leaders casually dismiss [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=585.82s)]
*  the consequences of going to war with a nuclear-armed nation. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=590.6600000000001s)]
*  Dismiss the consequences of nuclear war. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=594.62s)]
*  Like, it's not even worth thinking about. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=596.62s)]
*  But it is worth thinking about. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  They tell us daily Vladimir Putin is evil and insane. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=600.48s)]
*  And that may well be true. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=603.2600000000001s)]
*  But this same man has threatened to use nuclear weapons against the United States and Western [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=605.38s)]
*  Europe if this continues. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=609.94s)]
*  And why don't we believe him? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=611.46s)]
*  You may have missed this. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=613.94s)]
*  I know that sometimes didn't seem like time to cover it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=615.0600000000001s)]
*  But here's Russia's foreign minister just last week underscoring the point. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=616.7800000000001s)]
*  Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov with a chilling warning. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=621.5400000000001s)]
*  The risk of nuclear war is a real one. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=624.9000000000001s)]
*  Speaking to state-run media, Lavrov said, quote, the danger is serious. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=627.1400000000001s)]
*  It is real. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=631.0s)]
*  It cannot be underestimated. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=632.0s)]
*  He added that he did not want to see these risks of nuclear war, quote, artificially [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=633.58s)]
*  inflated. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=637.82s)]
*  He does not see it as an artificially inflated sense. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=638.98s)]
*  Risk, says Lavrov. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=643.78s)]
*  So what they're saying is we will use nuclear weapons against you and your allies if you [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=646.42s)]
*  don't back off. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=654.18s)]
*  If, for example, this seems existential, like you're trying to overthrow our government. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=655.18s)]
*  It's hardly defensive Russia to say that's a real possibility. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=658.94s)]
*  And has been for quite some time. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=661.72s)]
*  So it was two years ago that Vladimir Putin revised Russia's nuclear deterrent policy. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=663.5s)]
*  Now, the new policy allows Russia to use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional strike. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=668.02s)]
*  That means some sort of non-nuclear provocation. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=673.58s)]
*  Now, in March, Russia's former president, Dmitry Medvedev, who sits on Russia's Security [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=675.7s)]
*  Council, reminded our country of this policy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=680.22s)]
*  He warned Joe Biden that Russia would indeed use nuclear weapons against the West in response [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=683.7s)]
*  to any, quote, act of aggression that is committed against Russia and its allies. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=689.82s)]
*  Now, what would that look like? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=694.3000000000001s)]
*  Would it include helping to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of Russian [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=696.34s)]
*  troops? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=700.1s)]
*  The Pentagon has admitted doing that. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=701.86s)]
*  You don't have to be for Russia to see that as a pretty reckless act and not just doing [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=704.22s)]
*  it but then bragging about it to NBC News. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=708.62s)]
*  Where does that get us? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=710.66s)]
*  We should find out. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=713.26s)]
*  We do know that Putin has placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=715.04s)]
*  And again, Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=719.5s)]
*  And again, why wouldn't he use those weapons? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=722.96s)]
*  They tell us daily he is evil and insane and he may well be. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=725.9s)]
*  A risk? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=730.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=731.26s)]
*  But no one in Washington seems worried in the slightest. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=732.26s)]
*  In fact, Congressman Adam Kinzinger, who is clearly something to live for at this point, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=734.3000000000001s)]
*  is now calling for a blank check, an open-ended conflict in Ukraine using the same legal justification [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=737.78s)]
*  that got us into Iraq for nearly 20 years. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=743.82s)]
*  He wants an authorization to use military force. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=746.5s)]
*  Watch. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=749.26s)]
*  Senator Kaine was with us and he said it is too soon to begin talking about potential [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=750.26s)]
*  use of force in Ukraine. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=754.62s)]
*  Do you think he's right? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=756.4200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=758.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=760.7s)]
*  I don't think we need to be using force in Ukraine right now. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=761.7s)]
*  I just introduced an AUMF, an authorization for the use of military force, giving the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=764.86s)]
*  president basically congressional leverage or permission to use it if WMDs, nuclear, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=769.5s)]
*  biological or chemical, are used in Ukraine. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=775.62s)]
*  It doesn't compel the president to do it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=777.46s)]
*  It just says if it is used, he has that leverage. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=779.58s)]
*  There may be a point that we have to recognize. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=782.9000000000001s)]
*  Look, this is at World War II. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=785.58s)]
*  Prior to World War II, there were moments nobody ever wanted to get involved and eventually [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=788.02s)]
*  came to realize they had to. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=791.84s)]
*  I hope we don't get to that point here, but we should be ready if we do. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=793.62s)]
*  Prior to World War II, says Adam Kinzinger. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=797.82s)]
*  So last year, Adam Kinzinger was a guy who had been redistricted out of his own district [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=799.82s)]
*  and was trolling for some kind of cable news contributorship. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=803.66s)]
*  The future looked grim for Adam Kinzinger. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=806.86s)]
*  Now Adam Kinzinger is on the Sunday shows every weekend doing his Winston Churchill [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=808.92s)]
*  imitation. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=812.54s)]
*  So you can see there's a built-in incentive for mediocre and intellectually limited members [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=813.54s)]
*  of Congress to play the war hawk. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=817.74s)]
*  But you have to ask yourself why all of a sudden is everybody talking about chemical [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=821.3s)]
*  and biological weapons? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=825.5s)]
*  It was just a couple of weeks ago that Joe Biden, the president of the United States, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=826.5s)]
*  promised to respond, quote, in kind to the potential use of chemical weapons by Russia. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=830.9s)]
*  In other words, the United States would use its chemical weapons against the Russians [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=836.34s)]
*  if they use theirs against the Ukrainians. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=839.1800000000001s)]
*  And then because you're not supposed to admit that you have chemical weapons, Joe Biden's [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=841.82s)]
*  national security adviser, whose memory still works, walked it back and told us, oh, no, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=845.02s)]
*  no, the president misspoke. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=849.22s)]
*  Just like he did when he told us this was a regime change war. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=850.22s)]
*  We would never use chemical weapons, said Jake Sullivan. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=852.78s)]
*  But for some reason, a lot of people in Washington in both parties are still talking a lot about [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=855.9399999999999s)]
*  the U.S. using chemical weapons in Russia. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=860.74s)]
*  Here's one of the most limited members of Congress, Michael McCaul, Republican from [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=864.02s)]
*  Texas, widely regarded as a mouthpiece for the intel agencies. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=867.42s)]
*  Listen to what he says. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=870.66s)]
*  What would happen if a chemical weapon was dropped in Ukraine and or a short-range tactical [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=872.78s)]
*  nuke? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=879.18s)]
*  The question there is, would the world idly sit back and watch that happen without doing [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=880.18s)]
*  anything? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=886.26s)]
*  What would we? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=887.26s)]
*  What should we do? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=888.6999999999999s)]
*  I just find it hard to believe. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=891.98s)]
*  And when I talk to the secretary general of NATO, their job is really to defend NATO, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=893.42s)]
*  not trigger Article 5. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=898.62s)]
*  And in my judgment, that that's beyond the pale. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=900.46s)]
*  That crosses a red line. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=903.9000000000001s)]
*  And I think if that happens, we would have to respond in kind. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=905.86s)]
*  So stories like this give people like Michael McCaul a chance to give you a moral lecture [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=911.5600000000001s)]
*  on television, which is the whole appeal. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=914.7800000000001s)]
*  But again, all of a sudden you have sitting members of Congress with access to high level [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=916.58s)]
*  intelligence talking casually about using chemical weapons or nuclear weapons against [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=921.46s)]
*  a nuclear armed state. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=926.5s)]
*  So it's not a defense of Russia. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=928.94s)]
*  You don't have to believe Russia was justified in invading Ukraine. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=930.9000000000001s)]
*  They weren't. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=934.3000000000001s)]
*  It's not a defense of Putin to think to yourself, hold on a second here. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=936.2600000000001s)]
*  How did we get here? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=940.36s)]
*  Talking about nuclear war on the Sunday shows. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=941.72s)]
*  Should we be? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=944.2600000000001s)]
*  Are we ready for that? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=945.2600000000001s)]
*  It's clear no one in the Biden administration cares or is worried about it at all. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=946.2600000000001s)]
*  The escalation continues at a remarkable pace. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=951.0200000000001s)]
*  And you know that if you watch the money. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=953.2s)]
*  We're continuing to shovel cash to the government of Ukraine, which just last year Democrats [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=954.98s)]
*  described as one of the most corrupt in the world. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=960.0600000000001s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=961.86s)]
*  And we're sending money to Ukraine at levels that are astounding. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=962.86s)]
*  Joe Biden signed off on a funding package in March for $13.6 billion in aid for Ukraine. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=966.58s)]
*  Then he sent an additional $1.3 billion in late April. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=972.4200000000001s)]
*  Then he sent $350 million in February. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=975.14s)]
*  He also sent $800 million in March. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=977.62s)]
*  In addition to all of that, Joe Biden has requested another $33 billion for Ukraine. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=979.26s)]
*  And that request includes funding for quote, longer range artillery of a heavier caliber [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=985.28s)]
*  than the howitzers we've already been sending there. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=990.26s)]
*  In other words, we're sending artillery to Ukraine that could easily strike Russian territory. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=992.06s)]
*  And we're sending $33 billion to do it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=997.3s)]
*  Now, how much is 33 billion in a moment when Congress is writing checks for trillions? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=999.42s)]
*  Well, to put it into context, $33 billion is more than double what the Biden administration [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1003.98s)]
*  spends protecting our national borders. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1009.26s)]
*  And that's just one check to Ukraine. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1012.1s)]
*  But it's double the annual budget to protect our borders. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1013.66s)]
*  The Biden administration, in fact, it's more than double, just requested $15 billion for [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1016.4599999999999s)]
*  the entire budget for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1021.54s)]
*  And just $8 billion for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1025.06s)]
*  So we're spending twice on their borders what we spend on our own in one request, in one [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1029.1s)]
*  week. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1036.02s)]
*  How much is 33 billion? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1037.02s)]
*  Well, it's more than we spend on Veterans Affairs every month, taking care of our own [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1038.8999999999999s)]
*  veterans. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1043.54s)]
*  And the saddest point of all of this is it hasn't caused the Russians to withdraw from [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1045.08s)]
*  Ukraine and no one's claiming that it will. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1049.26s)]
*  It hasn't bankrupted Putin. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1051.8999999999999s)]
*  It hasn't crippled the Russian economy. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1053.6s)]
*  It's certainly hurt our economy. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1055.4399999999998s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1057.86s)]
*  Well, the Daily Mail is reporting that a Russian oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1058.86s)]
*  he's on the bad guy list, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1063.6999999999998s)]
*  No, because he met with the president's son in Moscow several times to discuss investment [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1065.4199999999998s)]
*  deals. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1071.4199999999998s)]
*  So that oligarch, strangely, is being sanctioned by the UK, but not by the Biden administration. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1072.4199999999998s)]
*  The Biden administration, for all its bellicose talk about Russia, has decided not to sanction [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1078.2199999999998s)]
*  the one oligarch whose friends with the president's son. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1083.14s)]
*  So just to restate, this has nothing to do with Ukraine. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1087.7s)]
*  The war in Ukraine does not have anything to do with Ukraine, the long-term fortunes [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1092.18s)]
*  of the country, or the health and safety of its people. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1097.68s)]
*  It has to do with a lot of other things. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1100.5800000000002s)]
*  The Biden administration's request, for example, for Ukraine aid, didn't see this coming, includes [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1102.7800000000002s)]
*  a pathway to citizenship for Afghan refugees, their spouses and children. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1107.26s)]
*  Quote, the secretary of homeland security in the secretary's discretion may adjust [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1112.86s)]
*  the status of an Afghan national to that of an individual lawfully admitted for permanent [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1116.58s)]
*  residence. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1120.5s)]
*  Oh, so in an aid package meant to defend the borders of another sovereign nation, we continue [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1121.5s)]
*  to degrade our own. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1128.06s)]
*  Bet you didn't think defending Ukrainian democracy meant admitting tens of thousands of more [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1129.06s)]
*  foreign nationals into this country overnight. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1133.4599999999998s)]
*  If you want to know why our leaders are determined to escalate this conflict, there's your answer. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1137.3999999999999s)]
*  It means more power for them. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1142.46s)]
*  It means revenge for the 2016 election. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1144.74s)]
*  And if that means triggering a nuclear conflict between our nation and theirs, so be it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGvO8b-tiaM&t=1148.7s)]
