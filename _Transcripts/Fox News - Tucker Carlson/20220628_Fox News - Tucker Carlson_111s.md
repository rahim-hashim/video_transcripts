# Liberals direct their rage at Clarence Thomas over abortion ruling
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw)
*  Mark Paoletta is an attorney, a close friend of Clarence Thomas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=0.0s)]
*  He has a new book called Create Equal, Clarence Thomas in his own words, and a film. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=3.6s)]
*  We just interviewed him the other day. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=7.68s)]
*  He joins us again tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Mark, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  So it does seem like you had six Supreme Court justices vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=12.16s)]
*  Again, you could be for legal abortion and still recognize Roe v. Wade was an absurd [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=17.68s)]
*  Supreme Court decision that degraded the institution of the court and be against it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  But why Thomas? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=26.28s)]
*  Why are they going after one out of six? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=27.48s)]
*  Because the left is racist, Tucker. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=32.28s)]
*  They expect Clarence Thomas to think the way a black man should based on the color of his [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=35.08s)]
*  skin. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=40.8s)]
*  And Clarence Thomas for 30 years, 40 years has refused to do that and they want to destroy [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=41.8s)]
*  him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=45.72s)]
*  And that's what they've been doing and coming after him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=46.72s)]
*  And the bottom line is Clarence Thomas doesn't care at all what they think. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=47.84s)]
*  It's just so funny though. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=54.0s)]
*  I mean, if you compare the attitudes of the average black guy in America to the average [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=55.16s)]
*  white liberal in America on abortion, the black guy is way more opposed to abortion [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=59.76s)]
*  than the average white liberal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=63.64s)]
*  So why does Clarence Thomas have to have the same views as an NPR listener? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=65.32s)]
*  And that's what he's been saying for 40 years. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=70.32s)]
*  And it's the left demands it and they will they will go after him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=72.28s)]
*  But it is a great day for the Constitution, you know, with Roe being overturned, with [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=75.6s)]
*  the Second Amendment being strengthened, consistent with the Constitution, with religious [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=81.84s)]
*  liberties today coming down, consistent with the Constitution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=85.64s)]
*  And it's all aligning with where Clarence Thomas has been for the past 30 years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=88.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a fair point. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=93.36s)]
*  He's been saying it this whole time, as you point out in your book. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=95.84s)]
*  Mark, great to see you again. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=98.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBNDrNdVyw&t=99.4s)]
