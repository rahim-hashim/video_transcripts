# Tucker Carlson's Final Exam: Kayleigh McEnany vs. Emily Compagno
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8)
*  This isn't just a news program, there's a game show component, it's called Final Exam. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=0.0s)]
*  We don't just pull people off the street to compete, we find actual news professionals, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=7.2s)]
*  people who watch the news for a living to determine who's been paying the closest attention [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=12.4s)]
*  to what's happening in the world. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=17.46s)]
*  This week's contestants are both co-hosts about numbers, Haley McEnany and Emily Compagny. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=19.32s)]
*  And we are glad to have you both. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  I can't even guess, I've gotten some inside tips on who might have the advantage, but [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=26.68s)]
*  I'm not going to reveal those. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=31.48s)]
*  Emily. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=33.2s)]
*  No, hardly. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=34.2s)]
*  I have the reflexes of a sloth. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=35.2s)]
*  I can say sincerely, I'm rooting for you both. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=39.08s)]
*  Now you know the rules, I'm just going to repeat them just in case you've forgotten. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=41.16s)]
*  Hands on buzzers, I ask the questions, they're all multiple choice. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=44.8s)]
*  The first person to buzz in gets to answer. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=48.56s)]
*  Critically you have to wait until I finish asking the question and all possible answers [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=51.2s)]
*  before answering. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=54.28s)]
*  Every correct answer is worth one point, get it wrong, lose a point, best of five wins. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=55.9s)]
*  Are you ready? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=59.26s)]
*  Ready to go. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=60.26s)]
*  Okay, here's an amazing story. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=61.26s)]
*  I know you're going to know the answer. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  A Massachusetts woman protesting an eviction has been charged with assault and battery [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=63.699999999999996s)]
*  for attacking the police in a very unusual way. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=69.06s)]
*  What weapon did she use? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=72.08s)]
*  Was it A, a ferret? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=73.84s)]
*  Was it B, venomous snakes? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=76.1s)]
*  Was it C, a swarm of bees? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=78.66s)]
*  Oh, good job, yes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=81.1s)]
*  Oh wow, okay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=84.02s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to go with A, a ferret? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=85.14s)]
*  I mean that'd be fun. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=87.33999999999999s)]
*  You know that would have been my guess, that's kind of a traditional weapon of evictes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=88.94s)]
*  Did she employ a ferret in this case? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=94.46s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  This woman has now been charged with assault and battery for unleashing a swarm of bees [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=98.3s)]
*  on sheriff's deputies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  They say she smashed a lid and flipped a hive over to agitate the bees and make them more [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  aggressive. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=110.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=111.22s)]
*  Bees got the ferret. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=112.22s)]
*  Bees got the ferret. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=113.42s)]
*  I was, you know, and obviously I'm pro-police, but I'm kind of impressed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=114.42s)]
*  Swarm of bees, amazing, you never hear that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=118.94s)]
*  Okay, question two. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  Take a look at the picture on your screen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=123.06s)]
*  It's not a demon from the pits of hell, it's an extreme close-up of a bug's face. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=125.02s)]
*  The question is, what kind of bug is it? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=129.9s)]
*  Is it A, a bed bug? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=133.06s)]
*  Is it B, an ant? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=134.7s)]
*  Or is it C, a black-horned beetle? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=136.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=143.62s)]
*  Bed bug, ant, black-horned beetle. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=144.62s)]
*  It is an ant. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=145.62s)]
*  I saw this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=146.9s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=147.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=148.9s)]
*  We're going to see if you're correct. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=149.9s)]
*  That's your guess. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=152.7s)]
*  Here's the answer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=154.7s)]
*  We're about to show you something that will haunt your dreams. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=155.7s)]
*  It's a close-up of a face that borders on demonic and it's a shot of an ant. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=158.94s)]
*  It's an ordinary ant. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=163.42s)]
*  What we thought was just a benign pest. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=164.9s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=166.9s)]
*  It has angry red eyes and seemingly long. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=167.9s)]
*  You're doing great. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=169.9s)]
*  You're doing great. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=170.9s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=171.9s)]
*  So it was an ant. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=173.58s)]
*  And we move on to question three. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=174.58s)]
*  Congratulations, by the way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=176.58s)]
*  Here's that question. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=177.58s)]
*  So, every October, hundreds of people flock to a place called Casterly, Belgium for a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=178.58s)]
*  very different kind of race. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  Participants dress in Halloween costumes and paddle across a lake in boats made of what? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=186.38s)]
*  Is it A, pumpkins? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  B, plastic bottles? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=193.82s)]
*  Or is it C, rubber ducks? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=196.02s)]
*  Emily. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=199.02s)]
*  I'm guessing C, rubber ducks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  No, that wouldn't be my guess, too. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  I have no idea if it's correct or not. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  But we'll find out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  Is it boats of rubber ducks? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  Check out this annual Belgian Halloween tradition. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  A pumpkin boat paddle racing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  The tradition begins with Belgians scooping up a bag of pumpkins until there's a weapon. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  I knew there was a rubber duck event somewhere. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  See, I would have thought rubber duck, too, but it's a massive pumpkin. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  This is a Prince Harry question. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=231.26s)]
*  Prince Harry, I think it's his actual name, is releasing a tell-all memoir. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=232.76s)]
*  It's described as emotionally powerful and remarkably personal about his life in the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=237.38s)]
*  public eye. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=242.05999999999997s)]
*  So, the name of the book has just been revealed. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=243.05999999999997s)]
*  Is it A, ginger and miserable? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=245.42s)]
*  My life is a royal sellout. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  Is it B, my crazed narcissistic wife is a nightmare? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=251.16s)]
*  Or is it C, spare? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to go with C. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=260.18s)]
*  You don't think it's my crazed narcissistic wife is a nightmare. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=263.18s)]
*  You think it's spare. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=267.18s)]
*  I prefer that one. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=268.18s)]
*  I prefer that one. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=269.18s)]
*  I prefer that one. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=270.18s)]
*  I prefer that one. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=271.18s)]
*  Okay, let's find out if you're correct. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=272.18s)]
*  Is it spare? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=273.18s)]
*  And we're getting a first look at the cover of Prince Harry's highly anticipated memoir [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=274.18s)]
*  titled Spare. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  The title is taken from the saying, air and spare, and not to Harry's thought. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=282.3s)]
*  It should be why I hate the First Amendment. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=286.18s)]
*  Tell a little memoir. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=289.7s)]
*  It should be. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=290.7s)]
*  I gave up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=291.7s)]
*  I left. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=292.7s)]
*  I left. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=293.7s)]
*  I left. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=294.7s)]
*  I left. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=295.7s)]
*  Spare. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=296.7s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=297.7s)]
*  I'd prefer B, but we don't make the rules here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=298.7s)]
*  Okay, final question. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=300.7s)]
*  We're going to end on an animal as we always do. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=301.94s)]
*  So, here's the question. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=304.3s)]
*  Which U.S. city is so overrun with filthy vermin that city has been now called America's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=306.54s)]
*  radiest city? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=313.3s)]
*  Is it A, Baltimore? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=314.9s)]
*  Is it B, Los Angeles? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=317.62s)]
*  Or is it C, Lori Lightfoot, Chicago? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=319.46s)]
*  Oh! [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=322.46s)]
*  Emily! [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=323.46s)]
*  Yes! [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=324.46s)]
*  Two-point question. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=325.46s)]
*  C, Chicago. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=326.46s)]
*  C, Chicago. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=327.46s)]
*  Lori Lightfoot, Chicago, the radiest city. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=328.46s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=332.9s)]
*  Pest control company Orkin says that the Windy City is the worst capital of the U.S. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=334.9s)]
*  Chicago has talked from this for the past eight years. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=340.9s)]
*  And I was like, surprised I literally see rats every day on the way to Orkin. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=343.9s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=347.17999999999995s)]
*  So, you got that correct. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=348.17999999999995s)]
*  So, now we find ourselves unusually in a tie. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=349.53999999999996s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=352.85999999999996s)]
*  It does. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=355.02s)]
*  It makes sense because you went from negative one on a two-point question. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=356.02s)]
*  So, we're going to go to our traditional tie-breaking question. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not multiple choice. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=362.06s)]
*  It's a very simple question. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=363.44s)]
*  Almost nobody knows the answer. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to throw it to you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  You ready? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  What is the capital of Canada? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=369.09999999999997s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=372.09999999999997s)]
*  Kaylee. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  That was Emily. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  Emily. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=376.3s)]
*  Rather, Emily. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=377.3s)]
*  Ottawa. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=378.3s)]
*  I don't think that's right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=379.3s)]
*  Let me check. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=382.3s)]
*  Or like Ontario. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=383.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=384.3s)]
*  Our judges are saying the capital of Canada, which is a country, is Ottawa. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=385.3s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=390.3s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=391.3s)]
*  You're one in a million. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=392.3s)]
*  I love it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=393.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=394.3s)]
*  That a remarkable comeback by Emily. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=395.3s)]
*  You get our patented Federal Government. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=396.3s)]
*  Which highlights the growth on the back of John Federman's neck. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=399.5s)]
*  But I will say that I am giving this to Kaylee because she doesn't have one yet and I love [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=402.5s)]
*  you. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=408.5s)]
*  And you know I have a love for Federman. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=409.5s)]
*  And we are a team. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=410.5s)]
*  So, it's your mug. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=411.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=412.5s)]
*  So, you're passing the Goiter mug to a friend. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trugv_ZEIB8&t=413.5s)]
