# Americans need to know what this will truly cost: Tulsi Gabbard
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4)
*  Chelsea Gabbard is pro-American, a lifelong Democrat, former presidential candidate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=0.0s)]
*  We're always grateful to have her join us tonight. Chelsea Gabbard, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=3.6s)]
*  So if you were in the House still, you left after the end of last cycle. But if you were still there, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=7.04s)]
*  I don't think you'd be able to say a single word without being denounced as pro-Russia. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=15.36s)]
*  Which is a problem for democracy. I think the real question here, Tucker, that we're all asking these [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=21.28s)]
*  leaders in Washington is, what's the rush? Why are our political leaders from both parties rushing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=26.88s)]
*  this through without giving the American people the opportunity to actually look at what's in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=33.12s)]
*  bill and examine what the cost will be to us? Not just today with this bill, but with the next round [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=37.92s)]
*  of $40 billion or whatever billions they will ask for in the next round, in the next round, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=45.2s)]
*  in the next round. The reality is there's no imminent threat to the safety, security and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  freedom of the United States coming to us from Russia. In fact, there's no imminent threat, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=55.2s)]
*  or even long-term threat, of Russia invading Finland or Sweden. Russia can barely hold on to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  a very small sliver of Ukraine right now. So again, I ask these leaders, what is the rush? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=66.88s)]
*  What we do know is that the Biden administration has failed to clearly define any objective [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=74.16s)]
*  in this proxy war in Ukraine. They have failed to define what winning looks like. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=81.04s)]
*  Clearly, there is no end in sight without that being defined. We can look at Afghanistan and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  Iraq as very recent examples of what happens when you don't have that clearly defined mission. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=90.0s)]
*  The American people were struggling with high inflation, basic necessities that people need [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=97.28s)]
*  to live, costs increasing, and yet with this $40 billion of funding and what will come next, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  and next, and next, the American people deserve to know what this will cost us financially, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=108.56s)]
*  what it will cost our economy, and what it will cost our national security with the increased [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=113.2s)]
*  potential of a nuclear conflict if this is allowed to continue. The more I think about it, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=117.92s)]
*  it takes a lot of gall for I. Patch McCain to attack moms who are worried about baby formula [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=124.8s)]
*  as quote pro-Russia. That's probably one of the most outrageous things I think I've ever heard [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  now that I'm thinking about it. Why not just answer the question? Why the attacks? What does [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=134.0s)]
*  that tell you? It tells you that they don't really want the American people to know [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=138.16s)]
*  what is in this bill and what will come next and what it will truly cost us, not just a few of us, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=143.92s)]
*  but all of us as the American people today and what appears to be if we continue down this path [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  for the long term to come. That should be a huge red flag for the American people as they look at [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=155.44s)]
*  leaders in Washington resorting to name calling and smearing rather than actually providing these [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=160.48s)]
*  clear explanations to the American people. Man, you've been smeared since day one. You've never [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=164.96s)]
*  lost your composure or moved off course, and I definitely admire the way you've handled the attacks. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=171.12s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, thank you. Thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdl__Ul4mw4&t=177.52s)]
