# 400 missiles have rocked Ukraine to date: Lucas Tomlinson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw)
*  Fox News Lucas Tomlinson is live in that country right now where it's left at 2 20 in the morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=0.0s)]
*  Lucas, can you hear me? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=5.2s)]
*  I sure can, Tucker. Just moments ago, U.S. officials told me there are several Russian warships underway from Crimea [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=7.2s)]
*  carrying Russian marines heading in the direction of Odessa, Ukraine's third largest city, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  and they're preparing for an amphibious assault Thursday, Tucker. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=19.7s)]
*  Now earlier explosions rocked Ukraine's capital city. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Holy shit! [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=30.0s)]
*  Fuck! [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=34.0s)]
*  Fuck! [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=37.0s)]
*  Fuck! [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=39.0s)]
*  It's right next to us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=41.0s)]
*  Russia has fired over 450 missiles into Ukraine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=43.0s)]
*  It's not always clear if they're hitting their intended targets. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=47.0s)]
*  This is Kharkiv's National University and Regional Police Department on fire in Ukraine's second largest city, roughly the size of Dallas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=50.0s)]
*  The Ukrainian government says 2,000 civilians have been killed since the start of the war last week. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=57.0s)]
*  This airbase near Kharkiv, another dramatic video of what the Russians have unleashed on this country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=62.0s)]
*  The situation on the ground looking more like Grozny and Syria, not the improved and modernized Russian military that Moscow is boasting about pre-invasion. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=66.0s)]
*  And British intelligence say five Ukrainian cities are now surrounded. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=75.0s)]
*  The Russian Defense Ministry for the first time put out casualty figures today, Tucker, said 498 Russian soldiers have been killed and 1,500 wounded. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=79.0s)]
*  Tucker? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=86.0s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson, thanks so much for your straight reporting. I appreciate it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ruMJhaqlw&t=88.0s)]
