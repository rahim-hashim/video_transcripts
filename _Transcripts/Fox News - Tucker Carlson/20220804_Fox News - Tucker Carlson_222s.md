# Hungarian official blasts CNN misinformation
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4)
*  Blasch Orban is Prime Minister Viktor Orban's political director. He joins us now to respond. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=0.0s)]
*  Blasch, thanks so much for coming on. Boy, it's so interesting. There are literally cannibals [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=7.04s)]
*  in charge of some countries on this globe. You have a country of 10 million people in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Central Europe. It's a small country. They spend so much time hating you. What do you [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=17.28s)]
*  think that's about? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=21.44s)]
*  Hello, Tucker. It's so good to see you. Actually, since 2015, from one day to another, 400,000 [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=24.36s)]
*  people tried to cross our borders illegally. We made the decision to establish the fence [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=35.0s)]
*  and try to protect our borders and maintain, or at least regain, law and order. We are under [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  constant heavy pressure from the globalist elites. They think that if somebody is speaking [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=50.36s)]
*  against mass migration, that he or she should be racist or anti-Semite or whatever. It's crazy, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=57.16s)]
*  but our policy is based on common sense. Our people are very proud. As you mentioned, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=65.64s)]
*  we are a 1,000-year-old nation. We are in the middle of Europe, but culturally we are an [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=72.68s)]
*  island. We are very proud of our history, our Judeo-Christian heritage. We want to preserve it [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=78.76s)]
*  in that way. To do so, you have to be able to protect your borders. It's so simple. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=86.2s)]
*  What's interesting is that the reality of Hungary, the experienced reality when you go there, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=92.84s)]
*  it's basically America 2005. It's a very moderate place with a more balanced free [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=97.48s)]
*  or press than we have, that's for sure. This caricature that it's China, that must affect [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=102.52s)]
*  you living there. You see these descriptions of your country that are just insane. They're [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=112.52s)]
*  disconnected from reality. You immediately realize that these accusations are politically [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=116.36s)]
*  motivated. Meanwhile, the people who are living there, they are very wise people. My experience [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=125.96s)]
*  is the same here in the United States. If you speak to ordinary people, they know what is good [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=131.72s)]
*  for their country and they know what they want to reject. They are just not satisfied with the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=137.4s)]
*  current administration or current elites. Let me give you one example. We are the neighbors of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=144.2s)]
*  Ukraine. Currently, we are hosting one million refugees for Ukraine. Some of them are staying, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=150.76s)]
*  some of them are going forward. We're talking about the 10 million countries. Everybody knows [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=159.32s)]
*  that those people are fleeing from war. There is no problem with them. Meanwhile, from the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  southern borders, illegal border crossers from other civilizations, from other parts of the world, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=171.0s)]
*  they want to cross the country and march through it and start a new life somewhere in Europe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=179.56s)]
*  Ordinary people can differentiate. They know that on one hand, you have to be welcoming to the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=186.2s)]
*  refugees and you have to say no to illegal border crossers. It's so simple, as I mentioned. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=193.0s)]
*  It is and inherently moderate. It's shocking to me that Sinan aired something like that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=199.72s)]
*  Let me apologize on behalf of American media. Thank you. Blas Robban, good to see you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=205.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzG-A-B5aq4&t=210.84s)]
