# Tucker, Candace Owens break down 'bizarre' Kamala Harris video
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c)
*  Why are we putting up this exactly and who's running it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Kamala Harris or Kamala Harris, depending on the day, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=4.0s)]
*  is officially in charge. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=6.96s)]
*  She's our border czar. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=8.24s)]
*  That's what Joe Biden says. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=9.28s)]
*  But she doesn't seem very interested in the job. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=10.8s)]
*  Instead, she spent the last week filming [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  a truly bizarre video for World Space Week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  But don't take our word for it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=21.16s)]
*  I just love the idea of exploring the unknown. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  And then there's other things [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=27.68s)]
*  that we just haven't figured out or discovered yet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=28.6s)]
*  To think about so much that's out there [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  that we still have to learn. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=34.24s)]
*  Like, I love that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=36.44s)]
*  I love that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  And so I'm very excited about the space council. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=38.6s)]
*  We're gonna learn so much as we increasingly, I think, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=40.36s)]
*  are curious and interested in the potential [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  for the discoveries and the work we can do in space. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=48.0s)]
*  So that's one of the things I'm most excited about. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=51.64s)]
*  But the other, you guys are gonna see, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=55.08s)]
*  you're gonna literally see the craters on the moon [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=59.24s)]
*  with your own eyes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=61.64s)]
*  With your own eyes, I'm telling you, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=64.16s)]
*  it is gonna be unbelievable. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=66.64s)]
*  So for humanitarian reasons, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=70.52s)]
*  we're not gonna play you that whole video, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=72.28s)]
*  but it's online. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  If you dare, look it up. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=74.84s)]
*  Watch it, watch it again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=76.72s)]
*  Watch your own soul die as you do. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=78.32s)]
*  It's the fakest thing that's ever been caught on video, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=81.32s)]
*  but in fact, it's even faker than it looks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=83.72s)]
*  We've just learned that one of the kids, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=85.52s)]
*  that Kamala Harris was lecturing at, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=87.16s)]
*  is in fact not a normal kid. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  He's a child actor called Trevor, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=92.0s)]
*  who auditioned for that role. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  No political party that believed in democracy [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=96.12s)]
*  and thought it had to win over voters [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=98.44s)]
*  would ever put up someone like Kamala [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=99.92s)]
*  or Kamala Harris for office. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=102.0s)]
*  So what does this tell us about the Democratic Party? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=103.44s)]
*  Candace Owens is the host of Candace. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=106.12s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=108.0s)]
*  Candace Owens, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=109.72s)]
*  So I don't know if you dared to watch that whole thing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=111.36s)]
*  And I'm not just being mean for political reasons. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=114.12s)]
*  I've never seen anything that fraudulent in my whole life. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=117.28s)]
*  It is really a bizarre thing to watch. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=121.88s)]
*  And it's just, the thing that's bizarre, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=124.12s)]
*  it's like you question yourself, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=125.32s)]
*  has she ever even been around children, by the way? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=126.56s)]
*  These are, as you reported, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=128.8s)]
*  this is somebody who was a child actor [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=130.36s)]
*  who reached out to his agent and asked to get this part. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=132.16s)]
*  He was called back weeks later and said, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=135.0s)]
*  yes, you got the part to star along [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=136.24s)]
*  the vice president of the United States [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=138.24s)]
*  and try to normalize and humanize her, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=139.56s)]
*  which he, you know, unfortunately for him, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=141.48s)]
*  he failed at because it's hard to humanize Kamala Harris. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=143.0s)]
*  And what's more bizarre is that he's 13 years old. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=146.0s)]
*  Why is she speaking to 13 year olds like this? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=148.44s)]
*  She's speaking like they're five years old, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  using the expressions and using her hands [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=153.28s)]
*  as if you're reading the hungry, hungry caterpillar [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=156.32s)]
*  to a kindergarten class. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=158.68s)]
*  It's so scripted, there's nothing authentic about her at all. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=160.24s)]
*  And then you wonder, like to me personally, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  whenever I watch her, I wonder whether or not, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=165.56s)]
*  forget whether or not she wants to be in front of children, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=167.52s)]
*  does she even want to be the vice president? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=169.16s)]
*  I think that's a question that's on a lot of Americans' minds [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  when it comes to her, because every time you see her, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=173.12s)]
*  she just seems so phony. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=174.96s)]
*  It seems like she's playing a part [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=176.16s)]
*  that she genuinely doesn't want to play. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=177.12s)]
*  I think that people that are accurately reporting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=179.24s)]
*  that there seems to be this shade war going on [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=181.76s)]
*  between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  I think that's accurate. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=185.28s)]
*  I think she genuinely resents being the vice president [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=186.28s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=188.64s)]
*  She genuinely resents being subordinate to Biden. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=189.48s)]
*  And she genuinely resents every element of her job, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=192.04s)]
*  including scripted elements like the one [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=194.44s)]
*  that we had to watch just tonight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=196.24s)]
*  Yeah, because I mean, it's a different level. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  They're all phony, all politicians are phony. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=199.8s)]
*  Every single one of them, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=201.44s)]
*  they're all weird, creepy personal lives, got it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=202.32s)]
*  But she's so phony that her phoniness [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=204.88s)]
*  is an act of aggression aimed at her audience. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=207.04s)]
*  I mean, she's daring you to watch her without vomiting. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=209.36s)]
*  I mean, she's literally that phony. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=212.36s)]
*  Yeah, she's so unlikable. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=215.88s)]
*  It's hard to think that they could ever put forth a woman [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=217.04s)]
*  that was more unlikable than Hillary Clinton, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=219.28s)]
*  but by golly, the Democrat Party is not. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=220.76s)]
*  I find her to be more unbearable [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=222.88s)]
*  and more unlikable than Hillary Clinton somehow. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=224.64s)]
*  And it's because it's the acting behind it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=226.72s)]
*  It's the phony laugh. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=228.8s)]
*  It's the cackling laugh. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=229.68s)]
*  And again, to have to go out and get actors. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  We see Joe Biden appearing in front of a set at the EEOB. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=233.76s)]
*  We've got Kamala Harris hiring child actors. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=237.04s)]
*  I mean, what is actually going on in this administration? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=239.64s)]
*  This really does feel like it's a Saturday Night Live skit. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=241.72s)]
*  You know, the same amount of viewers, not very many, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=244.27999999999997s)]
*  but it's like, do we have people [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=247.0s)]
*  that are actually running our country? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=248.56s)]
*  Or do we have actors that are just sitting around, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=250.11999999999998s)]
*  you know, saying what they're supposed to say, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=252.92s)]
*  reading off of teleprompters? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=254.32s)]
*  Why don't they just let us read the teleprompter? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=255.32s)]
*  It'd be much easier. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  She leaves you pining for the authentic maternal warmth [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=260.8s)]
*  of Hillary Clinton. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=263.44s)]
*  I mean, it's that bad. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=264.36s)]
*  Oh, can't I say it? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=265.44s)]
*  Great to see you tonight. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSlMnn0hc9c&t=267.56s)]
