# 'Chicken Lady' tells Tucker why she doesn't drink alcohol
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI)
*  So we're thinking the other day, who are some of our favorite guests? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, one of our all-time favorites is the chicken lady, Tiara Salheim. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=2.2s)]
*  We've had her on a bunch of times, so we decided, you know, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=6.8s)]
*  why not invite her in for an hour-long conversation on Tucker Carlson today? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=8.9s)]
*  And we're so glad that we did, because she turns out to be a very cool person. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=12.6s)]
*  We talked to her not just about chickens, but a whole bunch of things, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=18.1s)]
*  including alcohol and why she doesn't drink it, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=20.8s)]
*  Here's part of the conversation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=23.2s)]
*  In a world where everyone drinks casually, why do you not drink? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=30.0s)]
*  You know, I just don't see the good in it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=32.4s)]
*  It's expensive. It's not good for your body. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=34.3s)]
*  A lot of people make bad decisions when they drink, and I'm like, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=36.8s)]
*  not today, Satan. Not doing that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=40.3s)]
*  I'm not going down that path. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=42.3s)]
*  So I've avoided it, and honestly, it's worked out for me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=43.9s)]
*  It works out. It does actually, it does work out. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=47.8s)]
*  I completely agree with you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=50.3s)]
*  I don't need it. I don't want it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=51.6s)]
*  Was there ever social pressure to...? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=53.3s)]
*  People always will ask me, they'll be like, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=55.900000000000006s)]
*  Oh, why don't you drink? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=58.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, you know, personal reasons. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  And they're like, oh, are you Mormon? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=60.9s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I'm not Mormon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=61.9s)]
*  And they're like, oh, like, you know, are you a recovered alcoholic? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=63.4s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I just don't want to do it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=66.1s)]
*  That's a little off topic for a political show. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=71.0s)]
*  We'll admit that at the outset, but the chicken lady is great, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=72.7s)]
*  and we're really glad to interview her, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=76.1s)]
*  and we think you'll be glad to watch that interview. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=77.9s)]
*  Fox Nation, 7 a.m. tomorrow. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=79.8s)]
*  And changing your life. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=87.9s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEusUACH1AI&t=89.4s)]
