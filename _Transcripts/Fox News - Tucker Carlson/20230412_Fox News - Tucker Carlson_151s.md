# Trump is talking about topics no one else is talking about: Columnist
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q)
*  Charlie Hurt is opinion editor of The Washington Times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight with reaction to this. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=2.46s)]
*  Charlie, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=4.76s)]
*  Did you find it refreshing to hear someone, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  whether you agree with him or not, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=9.0s)]
*  talk about things that might actually define [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=10.48s)]
*  our grandchildren's lives? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=12.8s)]
*  Well, like you said a minute ago, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=15.84s)]
*  he's talking about things that nobody else is talking about. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  And of course, when was the last time somebody [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=21.6s)]
*  was doing that? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=24.2s)]
*  Well, that was when Donald Trump in 2016 [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=25.04s)]
*  was running the first time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  He was talking about things that nobody else [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=28.56s)]
*  was talking about in Washington. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=30.8s)]
*  And I think you and I agree, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  these people are desperate to ignore these issues [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=34.98s)]
*  and ignore these topics. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=37.8s)]
*  And as you say, whatever you think of Donald Trump, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=39.28s)]
*  he's a very smart businessman, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  and he's probably the shrewdest political observer [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=43.4s)]
*  that we've seen in this country on the political stage [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=46.42s)]
*  in a lifetime. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  And I thought it was so interesting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=53.28s)]
*  the degree to which he focused on foreign policy [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=54.6s)]
*  and identified that the great threat for us [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=58.64s)]
*  is indeed foreign policy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=61.36s)]
*  And when you look at the fact that in two years [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=62.64s)]
*  since he's been gone, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=65.16s)]
*  the Biden administration has given away [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=66.64s)]
*  our energy independence. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  It has launched a whole new war. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=70.64s)]
*  It has eroded our standing in the world [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=74.4s)]
*  to the point that China and Russia have aligned against us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=76.56s)]
*  And they're frittering away the US dollar. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=80.12s)]
*  And all of this is from Joe Biden, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=83.24s)]
*  who for 50 years has been the reigning [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=85.24s)]
*  foreign policy expert in Washington. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=88.32s)]
*  The whole reason he got picked as vice president [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=91.44s)]
*  is because he was the biggest genius at foreign policy [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=93.64s)]
*  that Washington ever produced. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=97.58s)]
*  And then you have this guy who's a real estate, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=100.3s)]
*  reality TV mogul, who walks in and calls their BS [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=102.56s)]
*  at every turn. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  And it turns out he's right about all of it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=107.64s)]
*  He's the great, Donald Trump is the best statesman [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=110.12s)]
*  when it comes to foreign policy especially, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  that we've had in decades. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=116.3s)]
*  We're closer to nuclear annihilation [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  than anytime in the history of nuclear weapons. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=122.2s)]
*  Right now, and all the liberals are ignoring it, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  and it falls to Trump to remind us of that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=129.22s)]
*  I've never seen anything crazier than this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=132.72s)]
*  Charlie Heard, appreciate your perspective as always. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=135.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha1SkDqeW1Q&t=137.44s)]
