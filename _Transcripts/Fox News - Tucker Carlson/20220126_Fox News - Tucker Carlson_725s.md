# Tucker: Biden only talks about skin color
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=0.0s)]
*  So here's a weird story, so many of those these days. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=11.18s)]
*  If you were anywhere near the Supreme Court in Washington this past spring, you may have [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=13.86s)]
*  seen a black box truck with New Jersey plates and a billboard on the side parked by the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=17.52s)]
*  side of the road. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=21.68s)]
*  Here's the truck. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=22.68s)]
*  In case you can't read the message, it says, Briar, retire. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=23.68s)]
*  It's time for a black woman Supreme Court justice. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=27.26s)]
*  There's no time to waste. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=29.88s)]
*  Those billboards were funded by a group of progressive Democrats called Demand Justice, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=31.88s)]
*  which weirdly enough is run by an extremely white guy called Brian Fallon, which is a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=35.68s)]
*  little strange if you think about it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  If Brian Fallon is so passionate about giving leadership roles to black women, why isn't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=42.0s)]
*  he resigned from his job and given it to one? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  You wonder that about a lot of people, Joe Biden, for example. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=49.36s)]
*  In any case, you got to hand it to Brian Fallon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=51.56s)]
*  Either he is remarkably prescient or someone in power was listening to him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=54.44s)]
*  Because just this morning it was announced that Stephen Briar is indeed retiring from [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=63.08s)]
*  And you notice the passive construction there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=64.08s)]
*  It was announced. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=66.32s)]
*  Because Briar himself did not announce his retirement. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=68.28s)]
*  It's not even clear if Briar knew the announcement was going to happen. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=70.56s)]
*  Someone leaked that news with or without Justice Briar's consent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=74.24s)]
*  They didn't wait for him to do it himself. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=77.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=79.6s)]
*  Because Democrats understand they're likely to lose the Congress this November. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=80.6s)]
*  And they want to control Briar's seat while they still can. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=84.4s)]
*  So what are they going to do with that seat? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=87.36s)]
*  We don't need to guess. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden was very clear about his plans nearly two years ago as he was running for president. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  He didn't tell us who he was going to do about COVID or foreign policy or the economy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=93.64s)]
*  But he was very precise about the Supreme Court. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=97.48s)]
*  Here's Biden in March of 2020 on the debate stage at CNN. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=99.76s)]
*  I committed that if I'm elected president and have an opportunity to appoint someone [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  to the courts, I'll appoint the first black woman to the courts. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=108.36000000000001s)]
*  My cabinet, my administration will look like the country. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=112.28s)]
*  And I commit that I will in fact appoint a, I'll pick a woman to be vice president. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=115.92s)]
*  I will appoint a black woman to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=122.04s)]
*  That was Biden's promise. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=125.72s)]
*  But which black woman exactly? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  Biden didn't tell us. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=129.12s)]
*  Biden didn't mention the Supreme Court nominee's legal qualifications or judicial philosophy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=130.88s)]
*  or ability to perform one of the most important jobs in the country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=135.36s)]
*  He didn't even tell us she was a nice person. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=138.36s)]
*  All he said was she's going to be black and she's going to be female because to him that's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=140.56s)]
*  all that mattered. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=143.96s)]
*  You almost got the impression that Joe Biden believes all black women are the same. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=145.32s)]
*  They're identical. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=149.56s)]
*  That was certainly the assumption in the Delaware of Joe Biden's youth 60 years ago. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=150.56s)]
*  Biden doesn't seem to have changed much. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=155.12s)]
*  You wonder if anyone sitting there in CNN's audience that night even noticed this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  It's possible we've all marinated for so long in the casual racism of affirmative action [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=161.4s)]
*  that it seems normal now to reduce human beings to their race. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=165.96s)]
*  But imagine if this was happening to you, how would you feel? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=170.32s)]
*  You go to law school, you win a clerkship, you get a seat on some lower court. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=172.92s)]
*  One day you're nominated to be one of the top nine judges in the country and you're [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=177.44s)]
*  proud of that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=180.76s)]
*  Why wouldn't you be? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=181.76s)]
*  Your parents are proud. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=182.76s)]
*  Your friends are proud. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=183.76s)]
*  But Joe Biden? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=184.76s)]
*  All Joe Biden can talk about is your skin color. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=185.76s)]
*  Patronizing? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=188.24s)]
*  That doesn't even begin to describe what this is. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=189.24s)]
*  This is exactly why decent Americans hated segregation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=191.92s)]
*  It dehumanized people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  Now Biden claims that his race counting is essential so that the court and the rest of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=197.32s)]
*  his administration, quote, looks like America. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  Of all the lies that Joe Biden tells, this could be the easiest to check. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  We have the latest census numbers and we can promise you with dead certainty that Joe Biden's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=208.44s)]
*  nominees look nothing like America, not even close. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=213.64s)]
*  Is that a problem? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=218.04s)]
*  Well, the problem for Biden is that once he starts saying things like this, once he begins [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=219.04s)]
*  every possible ethnic voting bloc equally, like some ward boss in 1950s Chicago, people [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=224.02s)]
*  are going to start to wonder about their quote representation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=229.9s)]
*  As long as we're divvying up the spoils like carrot cake, where's my slice? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  So Biden will nominate a black woman. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=237.34s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=239.38s)]
*  She'll represent about 7% of the population. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=240.38s)]
*  But where's Biden's Pacific Islander nominee? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=242.94s)]
*  Maisie Hirono is probably writing an outraged letter about that right now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=246.02s)]
*  No doubt she is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=248.78s)]
*  And why isn't there an American Indian on the court or a genderqueer or someone from [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=250.4s)]
*  the chronic fatigue syndrome community or a justice with cognitive disabilities? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=254.16s)]
*  Why isn't there an Afghan refugee under consideration? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=258.48s)]
*  You can laugh, but suddenly these are entirely fair questions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=262.62s)]
*  And by the way, Joe Biden, you claim that trans lives matter? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=265.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=268.76s)]
*  Do you really mean that? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=269.76s)]
*  Then prove it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=270.76s)]
*  What kind of woman is this anyway you plan to nominate? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=271.98s)]
*  What are her pronouns? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  You can see where this is going. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=277.44s)]
*  It always goes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=279.0s)]
*  Our identity politics always ends with tribal warfare. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=280.0s)]
*  It's funny that Biden people can't see that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  Maybe they can see it and don't care. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=286.4s)]
*  Or maybe it's the entire point of the exercise. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=287.68s)]
*  Whatever the explanation, the White House has no choice at this point to make good on [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden's promise. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=294.52s)]
*  The usual racemonger spent all day demanding it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=295.52s)]
*  Here's CNN. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=299.32s)]
*  I mean, it is a history-making moment. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=300.32s)]
*  It will change the way the court looks. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=303.24s)]
*  I think we cannot understate that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=306.92s)]
*  For this particular president, where he is today, with a need to give something that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=309.12s)]
*  is of great importance to his supporters, people who put him into office, especially [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=313.48s)]
*  black women, this is a really important moment. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=318.64s)]
*  I never had the luxury of leaving any part of my identity at the door before I walked [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=322.4s)]
*  into a courtroom, walked into a boardroom, walked onto these very sets on CNN. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=327.76s)]
*  I brought with myself the entirety of being a black woman, the lived experience of what [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=334.2s)]
*  that's like in a country like this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=338.92s)]
*  And I think it's incumbent upon our country to recognize that if we do not bring all of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=341.2s)]
*  America and the holistic views of people, including black women, then we are doing a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=346.0s)]
*  disservice to any objective evaluation of laws in this country. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=351.68s)]
*  Oh, this is so great. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=357.12s)]
*  That lady especially. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  Here you have the most privileged people in the United States of America telling you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=361.0s)]
*  at high volume, with total certainty, they're victims. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=365.2s)]
*  Now, that could describe most of CNN's programming, actually, but today it was especially hysterical [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=368.72s)]
*  and amusing. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=373.16s)]
*  That oppressed woman you just saw is called Laura Coats. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=374.16s)]
*  Laura Coats went to an expensive private school in Minnesota, then she headed off to Princeton, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=376.08s)]
*  and then she went to law school. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=380.2s)]
*  Now she's on TV, all because of how victimized she has been. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=381.2s)]
*  It's ominous enough to make you like America, when you learn that someone that completely [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=385.88s)]
*  marginalized is now so powerful. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=390.32s)]
*  Sounds like a success story. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=392.64s)]
*  But no, explains Laura Coats. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=394.24s)]
*  In fact, it's still more evidence that America is an evil and racist place. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=396.44s)]
*  What would it be like for somebody on the Supreme Court, finally, who looks like you? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=401.92s)]
*  I would be overjoyed and thrilled. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=408.24s)]
*  How much does John King hate himself? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=410.36s)]
*  I mean, he's got to, right? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=414.36s)]
*  On some level, saying stuff like that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=415.36s)]
*  What would it be like to finally see someone on the Supreme Court that looks like you? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=418.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank God, finally, Laura Coats can have some justice in this country, at long last. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=420.96s)]
*  Maybe someone will send her to Princeton for free again, just to make it official. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=426.67999999999995s)]
*  She's been liberated. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=430.08s)]
*  But wait a second! [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=431.08s)]
*  Color counters? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=433.28s)]
*  What about Clarence Thomas? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=434.28s)]
*  He sort of vaguely looks like Laura Coats, the lady you just saw on TV, same race anyway. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=435.76s)]
*  Does he count? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=440.11999999999995s)]
*  No, he doesn't count. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=441.11999999999995s)]
*  Clarence Thomas isn't a race monger. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=442.11999999999995s)]
*  He believes in the Constitution of the United States. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=444.11999999999995s)]
*  He's Supreme Court justice. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=445.64s)]
*  Therefore, he's not really black. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=446.64s)]
*  See how that works? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=448.44s)]
*  He doesn't count. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=449.44s)]
*  So what are the potential nominees that CNN has declared are authentically black and therefore [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=450.44s)]
*  eligible for this job? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=455.8s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=457.8s)]
*  There's Sherrilyn Ifill. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=458.8s)]
*  Sherrilyn Ifill is not even a judge. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=459.8s)]
*  She's some kind of political activist who works at the NAACP. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=461.44s)]
*  Her primary credential, and she listed this prominently in her online biography herself, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  is that she was one of Glamour Magazine's Women of the Year in 2020. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=469.64s)]
*  Why is that not a qualification? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=475.32s)]
*  Glamour Magazine's Women of the Year in 2020? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  Send her forth to the Supreme Court! [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=481.48s)]
*  And then you look at her Twitter page. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=483.2s)]
*  Ifill's Twitter page is full of racist attacks against dreaded white people. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  Here's one example from July of 2018. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=489.4s)]
*  Quote, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=491.32s)]
*  Truth and reconciliation efforts have little chance in many places because whites view [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=492.32s)]
*  truth-telling as an act of violence. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=496.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=498.96s)]
*  They do? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=499.96s)]
*  All whites? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=500.96s)]
*  Oh yes, says Sherrilyn Ifill. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=501.96s)]
*  They're all the same. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=503.46s)]
*  Same skin color, same belief. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=504.68s)]
*  Now that's a common attitude on the left. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=507.56s)]
*  It's not a reassuring attitude for a Supreme Court justice. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=509.6s)]
*  We'll see how she does. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=512.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, CNN is also recommending a woman called Eunice Lee. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=513.84s)]
*  Now Eunice Lee may be a perfectly nice person. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=517.0s)]
*  We don't know, but she first became a judge in August of 2021. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=518.84s)]
*  That was, let's do the math, less than six months ago. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=522.2s)]
*  Candace Jackson Aquami has even less experience in that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=526.0s)]
*  She may be nice as well, but she reached the bench for the first time in July of last year. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=528.84s)]
*  The other nominees on CNN's list have more judicial experience. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=532.92s)]
*  We'll give you three guesses to how they got that experience, how they get there. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=535.68s)]
*  Wilhelmina Mimi Wright became an Associate Justice on Minnesota Supreme Court back in [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=539.0s)]
*  2012. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=542.5999999999999s)]
*  Now, the sad thing about what we're about to tell you is Mimi Wright may be the best [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=543.5999999999999s)]
*  judge ever, the smartest person ever. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=547.7199999999999s)]
*  But as always, the media minimized her, dehumanized her in its coverage. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=550.52s)]
*  The media celebrated her nomination not because of her legal ability, which they barely describe, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=556.8s)]
*  but because of the way she looks, her skin color. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=560.56s)]
*  And that is a big part of why Governor Mark Dayton appointed her in the first place. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=563.56s)]
*  He said that. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=567.1199999999999s)]
*  Here's how the Star Tribune covered her appointment. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=568.1199999999999s)]
*  Quote, Dayton's historic choice, first black female Supreme Court justice. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=569.64s)]
*  That was the headline. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=573.16s)]
*  Unmentioned is how she might do on the Supreme Court. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  Again, nobody wins in identity politics. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=577.4s)]
*  The people it's designed to help are completely dehumanized and patronized, reduced to colors [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  rather than human beings. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=584.76s)]
*  And in some cases, the rest of us get really crappy service because the best people aren't [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=586.84s)]
*  being chosen. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  That's just true. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=592.72s)]
*  Ability is the only criterion that matters. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=594.26s)]
*  Skin color is irrelevant. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=597.24s)]
*  Katanji Brown Jackson got the same treatment. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=599.52s)]
*  To be fair, we should note that unlike other candidates CNN is putting forward, Brown Jackson [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=601.6s)]
*  has authentically suffered in her life. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=605.72s)]
*  She's not joking. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=607.48s)]
*  She literally went to Harvard with Joy Reid. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=608.48s)]
*  I happen to know Katanji Brown Jackson. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=611.48s)]
*  I knew her as Katanji Brown when we were in college. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  So I think she's wonderful. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=616.12s)]
*  Imagine what that was like. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=618.88s)]
*  You went to college with Joy Reid? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=620.04s)]
*  I was in Fallujah. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=622.36s)]
*  You went to college with Joy Reid. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=623.36s)]
*  Who suffered more? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=624.36s)]
*  Well after leaving the rough and tumble of Cambridge with Joy Reid, Brown Jackson wound [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=626.36s)]
*  up on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals last summer. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=630.2s)]
*  Well her credentials, well here's how ABC News covered her confirmation at the time. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=633.8s)]
*  They told us that Jackson is, quote, the first black woman confirmed to an appellate court [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=637.2s)]
*  in a decade and she now be one of five black female circuit court judges currently serving. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=641.4s)]
*  But hey, who's counting? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=645.96s)]
*  Again, you have to wonder, Brown Jackson, who we don't know, maybe a super great person, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=647.24s)]
*  really smart person, how would you feel if you were her? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  What about her achievements? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=654.72s)]
*  Irrelevant. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  The media focused on her race and maybe there was a reason for that because her actual record [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=657.94s)]
*  as a judge, honestly pretty awful. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=661.36s)]
*  She's been overturned unanimously by the DC Appellate Court multiple times in just the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=664.36s)]
*  past few years. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=668.84s)]
*  So you have to wonder at this point, since we're going by skin color and gender, why [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=671.2800000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden is ignoring the obvious choice. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=675.48s)]
*  Why doesn't Biden strike a real blow for equity and just nominate Bridget Floyd? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=679.2s)]
*  Who's that? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=682.6s)]
*  Well, it's George Floyd's sister. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=683.6s)]
*  She's not a judge or a lawyer or whatever, but at this stage, who cares? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=684.6s)]
*  Clearly, that's not the point anymore, this law stuff. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=688.72s)]
*  As Nebraska Senator Roman Hruska once said in defense of one of Richard Nixon's dumber [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=693.36s)]
*  judicial nominees, quote, even if he is mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  and lawyers. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=702.7600000000001s)]
*  They're all equal to a little representation, aren't they? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=703.84s)]
*  Well sure they are. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=706.8s)]
*  Bridget Floyd could be a justice for the rest of us, or at least a slice of the rest of us. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKZNqH934o&t=707.96s)]
