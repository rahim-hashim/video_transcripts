# Tucker examines what's behind the deaths of humpback whales
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw)
*  We're living in an age when the precise opposite is true of almost every claim you hear in public [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=0.0s)]
*  So it probably shouldn't shock you that the people who care the least about the natural world are self-proclaimed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=5.48s)]
*  environmentalists, they're happy to wreck it for profit make the oil companies look like [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=10.72s)]
*  Look like deep environmentalists and if you doubt that take a look what's happening off the East Coast of the United States so-called green [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=17.92s)]
*  NGOs supported of course by the people they give money to in the Biden administration are [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=24.0s)]
*  Backing the construction of massive offshore wind turbines that appear to be killing large numbers of whales in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=28.82s)]
*  Just the last two months at least ten dead whales have washed ashore in New York in New Jersey [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=35.78s)]
*  And on Monday it happened again a 35 foot male humpback whale died and washed up on [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=41.14s)]
*  Lido Beach in Nassau County in Long Island. Bruce Blakeman is the county executive of Nassau [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=47.18s)]
*  He joins us tonight. Mr. Blakeman. Thank you so much for coming on [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=52.74s)]
*  So this seems this seems like one of those stories that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=56.42s)]
*  Since liberals want to save the whales or did when I was a kid you'd think we'd be getting an awful lot of attention [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  But it seems like nobody wants to talk about it. Why is that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=66.14s)]
*  Well, first of all [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=71.86s)]
*  I became very concerned when seven whales washed up on the shores of New Jersey because obviously [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=72.98s)]
*  We're just miles from New Jersey [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=79.14s)]
*  And then when I found out yesterday that a whale had washed up on our shores here in Lido Beach in Nassau County [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=81.58s)]
*  Obviously I became concerned because I know that there is construction taking place out in the ocean [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=89.94s)]
*  And I think that when you have so many of these large animals that wash up on shore dead [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=94.38s)]
*  That we now have to take a pause and investigate. Why is that happening? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=101.34s)]
*  We've got to find that out because sea life is an important part of living in Nassau County [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=106.1s)]
*  We've got whales we have seals we have dolphins and we've got tremendous fishing here [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=111.74s)]
*  People move here because they want to enjoy the beaches the wildlife and the water [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=116.1s)]
*  So it's a concern and it bears investigation [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=120.38s)]
*  Well, I would say and it's it's very odd considering that if you want to move your cows into a new pasture [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=124.06s)]
*  And some rare salamander is found there the federal government shuts it down [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  They're very uptight about killing animals [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=135.26000000000002s)]
*  And that's not all bad by the way, but here the biggest mammals in the world are dying in an unexplained way [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=137.74s)]
*  And there's no curiosity. I just think it's the strangest thing I've ever seen [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, you know listen there are a lot of people that are disingenuous [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  They can't find a balance. It's like talking about going all-electric [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=152.74s)]
*  That would be a danger to our America the way that we live they'll always be fossil fuels at least in my lifetime and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=157.06s)]
*  certainly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=165.1s)]
*  Alternative energy is important as well and you have to have alternative energy [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  but the fact of the matter is there's got to be a balance and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=170.38s)]
*  basically, there are people who can never strike that balance unless it's in order to their benefit and in this case [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=173.86s)]
*  I'm quite surprised that there aren't more [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=180.78s)]
*  Environmentalists and certainly people who are involved in protecting sea life and animals [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=184.18s)]
*  speaking out about this and at least asking for an investigation as to whether or not there's any [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=189.06s)]
*  Causal relationship between these whales dying and the construction and the sonar that's being used [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there are a lot of Americans who care deeply about the natural world about the environment [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  But the professional environmental groups are prostitutes and shills obviously if you're destroying the environment, you're not saving the environment [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  I would say anyway Bruce Blakeman. I sure appreciate your being willing to talk about this in public the Nassau County executive. Thank you [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVo6GP8Vmw&t=211.01999999999998s)]
