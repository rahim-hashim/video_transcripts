# Kyle Rittenhouse speaks to Tucker Carlson in first TV interview
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 22, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=0.0s)]
*  In retrospect, it's remarkable just how dishonest, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=2.44s)]
*  how thoroughly and intentionally dishonest [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=6.54s)]
*  the media coverage of the Kyle Rittenhouse story [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=8.44s)]
*  turned out to be. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=10.34s)]
*  All of it was a lie. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=12.08s)]
*  Rittenhouse was not a white supremacist. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=13.02s)]
*  He was never in a militia. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=15.08s)]
*  He never crossed state lines with a firearm. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=16.38s)]
*  The protest in Kenosha was not peaceful. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=19.26s)]
*  It was a riot, chaotic and violent. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=21.12s)]
*  Many of the rioters, by the way, carried guns. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=22.82s)]
*  Rittenhouse was hardly alone. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=24.92s)]
*  Rittenhouse didn't go to Kenosha looking for trouble. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=26.7s)]
*  His father lived there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=28.96s)]
*  Rittenhouse himself worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=30.3s)]
*  On August 25th of last summer, Rittenhouse went downtown [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=33.06s)]
*  to stand guard over a car lot. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=35.86s)]
*  Here's the context. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=38.3s)]
*  The night before, police in Kenosha had done nothing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=39.14s)]
*  as the mob burned businesses, including another car lot [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=41.84s)]
*  all the way to the ground. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=44.54s)]
*  So the business owner needed Kyle Rittenhouse's help. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=46.24s)]
*  He was looking to a 17-year-old for help, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=49.24s)]
*  if that gives you some perspective on how bad things were. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  And he asked for it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=54.22s)]
*  As Rittenhouse stood there, rioters threatened his life. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=56.16s)]
*  Then they attempted to kill him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=58.8s)]
*  In the end, Rittenhouse shot three attackers [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=60.54s)]
*  as he tried to run to the safety of the police. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=62.88s)]
*  A number of media outlets claimed the men [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=65.38s)]
*  Rittenhouse shot were black. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=67.18s)]
*  In fact, all three were white [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=68.52s)]
*  and all three had serious criminal records. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=70.16s)]
*  We could go on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=72.42s)]
*  Again, the media coverage was, from beginning to end, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=73.72s)]
*  a tapestry of lies. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  If you watched the trial last week, you know that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=77.86s)]
*  But what about Kyle Rittenhouse himself? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  What is he like? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  Apart from his testimony in court, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=84.06s)]
*  few Americans have ever heard his voice. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=85.66s)]
*  Over the next hour, we're gonna let Kyle Rittenhouse [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=87.92s)]
*  speak for himself. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=89.76s)]
*  You can make up your own mind what you think. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=90.76s)]
*  But before we start, one observation, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=93.0s)]
*  which you can't resist making. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=94.66000000000001s)]
*  It's hard to ignore the yawning class divide [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  between Kyle Rittenhouse and his many critics in the media. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=99.4s)]
*  Rittenhouse comes from the least privileged sector [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=102.84s)]
*  of our society. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=105.94s)]
*  During high school, he worked as a janitor [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=107.18s)]
*  and a fry cook to help support his family. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=108.84s)]
*  Last year, he got into college at Arizona State [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  and he's very proud of it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=113.48s)]
*  In the world Kyle Rittenhouse grew up in, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  it is not a given that kids go to college. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  During the course of our long conversation, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse struck us as bright, decent, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  sincere, dutiful and hardworking. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Exactly the kind of person you'd want many more of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  in your country. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=130.42s)]
*  He's not especially political. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=131.72s)]
*  He never wanted to be the symbol of anything. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=132.98s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse just wanted to keep violent lunatics [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=135.38s)]
*  from setting fire to cars. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=137.98s)]
*  In the America he grew up in, that was considered virtuous. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=140.3s)]
*  So if Rittenhouse seems a little bewildered [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=144.72s)]
*  and he doesn't get points during our interview, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=146.9s)]
*  thinking back over the last year and what happened to him, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=148.1s)]
*  that's probably why. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=149.8s)]
*  A lot of the things he assumed were true about this country [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=151.46s)]
*  turned out not to be true at all. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=153.9s)]
*  So in that way, he speaks for many of us. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=155.64s)]
*  Here's Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=158.2s)]
*  So tell me Kyle, how you wound up in Kenosha that day. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=160.88s)]
*  Well, it actually started on August 24th. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=166.72s)]
*  I was working my job as a lifeguard at the Recplex [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=169.88s)]
*  in Kenosha County and then the riots [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=173.06s)]
*  were still going on and a curfew was implied. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=176.12s)]
*  So I went to Dominic Black's house [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=178.66000000000003s)]
*  and I stayed the night over there [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  and saw the videos of the riots and the arson going on. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  What'd you think of it? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=189.94s)]
*  It was upsetting because Kenosha is my community [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  and I just was upset seeing my community up in flames. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=196.28s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you were. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=199.68s)]
*  So you're at your friend's house that night, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=202.04s)]
*  you've come back from working as a lifeguard. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=205.89999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  And then you decided to go in, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=209.04s)]
*  first year cleaning up graffiti, correct? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  Yes, so we say the night, I say the night, August 24th, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=213.94s)]
*  we wake up in the morning and we're talking, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=217.78s)]
*  we're like, let's go help our community, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=219.76s)]
*  let's go see what we can do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=221.88s)]
*  And we ended up at Ruther Central High School [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=223.0s)]
*  where we were cleaning graffiti for a couple hours [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  and then we met with the owners of Car Source [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=229.4s)]
*  and we offered to protect their business from fires, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=232.72000000000003s)]
*  making sure the other two properties [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  didn't get burned down like they did the night prior [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  and they agreed. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=242.24s)]
*  We came back, we went back to Dominic's house [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  and hung out there for a little bit [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=247.56s)]
*  and then we went to Car Source to help protect the property [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  and make sure it didn't set on fire again. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  So you get there, what do you see? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=257.8s)]
*  When I get there, I see in the beginning, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=260.64s)]
*  the morning of Ruther Central, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=265.08s)]
*  I see just spray paint everywhere, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=266.68s)]
*  I see smoke coming from the Car Source that was burnt down [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=269.0s)]
*  and it was quite upsetting [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=273.28s)]
*  as though somebody's business that got destroyed. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=275.4s)]
*  Yeah, so you said to the people who own the car lot, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=278.08s)]
*  I wanna protect your cars and they said, yes please. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=282.96s)]
*  I said, hey, I asked if they needed any help [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=286.16s)]
*  and they said, yes, if you can. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=289.32000000000005s)]
*  Where were the police? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=292.56s)]
*  I'm not sure really, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=295.56s)]
*  cause they have a hard job. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=297.12s)]
*  For sure. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  But I didn't really think they got the support they needed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  The National Guard should have been called August 23rd, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=304.56s)]
*  but the city of Kenosha failed the community. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  The governor, Tony Evers, failed the community [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=313.0s)]
*  and there should have been a lot more resources [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=316.88s)]
*  to help with that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=318.2s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=320.0s)]
*  So you've been criticized for carrying a firearm [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=321.32s)]
*  into the scene, but it's obvious from the tape [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=325.88s)]
*  that a lot of people, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  you were not the only one with a firearm, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=330.04s)]
*  there were rioters with firearms, was that obvious to you? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=331.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  So you saw other people with guns? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=335.68s)]
*  I did, there was a lot of people, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=338.56s)]
*  like there were rioters with firearms. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=341.76s)]
*  I remember one very distinctly, Joshua Zeminski [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=344.6s)]
*  was walking around with a pistol in his hand [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=347.6s)]
*  all that night with Joseph Rosenbaum. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=349.88s)]
*  Where did you first see Rosenbaum? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=353.72s)]
*  The first time I saw Rosenbaum [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=355.84s)]
*  was the first time he threatened to kill me. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=357.8s)]
*  It was at the corner of the car source lot [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=361.08s)]
*  that I was at primarily that night [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=363.6s)]
*  and I was asking people if they needed medical [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=366.16s)]
*  and he came up to me and Ryan Balch and he said, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=369.12s)]
*  if I catch any of you MFers alone, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=372.36s)]
*  I'm going to effing kill you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=374.8s)]
*  Had you ever seen him before? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=376.56s)]
*  I have not. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=377.92s)]
*  So you'd never seen this guy, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=379.28s)]
*  he walks up and threatens to kill you out of nowhere? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=380.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=383.24s)]
*  It was quite shocking, I was like, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=384.52s)]
*  why would somebody threaten to kill me? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=386.84s)]
*  I'm just asking if people need help on both sides. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=388.68s)]
*  I was there just to help anybody that needed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=391.68s)]
*  and shockingly, the only people I helped that night [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=394.92s)]
*  were rioters. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=398.48s)]
*  What kind of sense did you get from Rosenbaum? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=400.0s)]
*  That sounds deranged. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=402.12s)]
*  When he threatened to kill me, I was like, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=405.84s)]
*  what the heck just happened? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  Nobody's ever threatened to kill me up until that point [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=414.12s)]
*  and I was like, that's not something you say to somebody. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=418.24s)]
*  How long after that was it that he tried to grab your rifle? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=422.12s)]
*  It was about an hour and a half later [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=425.56s)]
*  and then there was actually a second time [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=427.52s)]
*  he said to the group, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=429.36s)]
*  this is the second time he threatened to kill everybody, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=433.56s)]
*  he said, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=435.56s)]
*  I'm going to effing kill you, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=437.96s)]
*  I'm going to cut your hearts out, you effing N-words. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=439.68s)]
*  Cut your hearts out? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=443.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=445.12s)]
*  Did any of the rioters try and calm him down or stop him? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=447.52s)]
*  What I noticed is the rioters were trying to, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  they were like disassociating with him [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=455.44s)]
*  because he was spewing the N-word around [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=457.2s)]
*  and they just didn't seem to want to have anything [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=459.88s)]
*  to deal with them, the rioters. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=463.2s)]
*  So he comes, he tries to grab your rifle, he gets shot, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=466.56s)]
*  you decide at that point, unless I'm misremembering, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=471.32s)]
*  you want to go turn yourself into the police. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=474.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=476.48s)]
*  After I shoot Mr. Rosenbaum, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=478.91999999999996s)]
*  he tried to grab my gun, I was running away, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=483.8s)]
*  there was a gunshot behind me, after I shoot him, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=486.56s)]
*  I run around the car [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=488.76s)]
*  because I was going to go render first aid to him. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  I wasn't able to because then there was a mob forming [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=492.76s)]
*  and calling for my execution to get him and kill him. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's when I tried to run to the police line [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  and get to the police. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=504.91999999999996s)]
*  And then I am attacked again. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=506.76s)]
*  By the guy who kicked you? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=509.44s)]
*  By jump kick man, yes. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=511.28s)]
*  Whose identity we didn't know, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  it turns out the prosecution knew it and hid it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=516.56s)]
*  Yeah, so we found out November 7th, the prosecution, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=518.8399999999999s)]
*  we went into the judge's chambers and the prosecution said, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  we identified jump kick man [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=527.48s)]
*  and the prosecution threw a fit a little bit. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=529.7199999999999s)]
*  They didn't want us to interview him, they were like, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  well, he's a victim and didn't want my investigators [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=536.76s)]
*  or my attorneys to interview him or ask him questions, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=541.8s)]
*  they just wanted to do it private, non-recorded [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=544.72s)]
*  and the judge said, no, no, no, it's gonna be recorded. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=546.96s)]
*  And then a couple hours later, they say, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=550.24s)]
*  oh, he asked for immunity and we're not gonna give it to him [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=552.9200000000001s)]
*  so we're not gonna be calling him as a witness. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, probably didn't wanna talk [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=557.96s)]
*  about his criminal record. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=559.6s)]
*  So you're running, trying to get to the police lines, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  you see the mob coming after you, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=565.36s)]
*  let's execute him, they're saying, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=567.64s)]
*  and then out of nowhere, you get dropped to the ground [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=570.52s)]
*  by the guy who kicks you in the head. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=573.36s)]
*  Did you see him coming? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=574.7600000000001s)]
*  I did, to backtrack a little bit, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=576.0s)]
*  actually as I'm running, Gage Gross-Groots [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=578.32s)]
*  came up to me with his phone and put it in my face [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=581.2s)]
*  and he said, what are you doing, did you just shoot that man? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  And I told him, I'm going to the police [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=586.5200000000001s)]
*  and he said, oh, okay and ran off [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=588.88s)]
*  and I kept running to get to the police [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  and that's when Anthony Huber strikes me [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=593.5600000000001s)]
*  with the skateboard as I'm running [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=596.48s)]
*  before I'm on the ground for the first time [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  and then I'm hit with a rock by somebody [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  in a white tank top and that's how I end up on the ground [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=603.92s)]
*  and I have four people around me from what I remember [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=608.6s)]
*  and I move my firearm in the direction [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=612.4s)]
*  and they back off with their hands up [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=615.12s)]
*  so I don't shoot them and then Jump Kick Man keeps coming [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=616.8s)]
*  and that's when I fired two shots at Jump Kick Man. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=620.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=624.84s)]
*  And you miss him and he kicks you? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=625.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=628.28s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=629.96s)]
*  After Jump Kick Man is running off, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=632.76s)]
*  Anthony Huber comes up and he grabs the barrel of my gun [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=636.6s)]
*  and then he hits me with his skateboard, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=640.36s)]
*  holding his trucks and that's when I shoot him one time. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=643.48s)]
*  Where did he hit you with the skateboard? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=647.76s)]
*  He hit me in the back of the head, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=649.24s)]
*  in the neck, the back of the head towards the neckline. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=651.88s)]
*  Did you think you were gonna be killed with that boy? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=657.52s)]
*  I did. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=659.28s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=660.28s)]
*  And then after Mr. Huber attacks me, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=662.0s)]
*  Mr. Grosskruz puts his hands up [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=665.52s)]
*  and then I have my rifle pointing in his direction [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=668.6s)]
*  for about a second and then once I lower my rifle, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=670.88s)]
*  I notice that my ejection port is opened about an inch [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=673.64s)]
*  and Mr. Grosskruz said I pulled the charging handle [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=678.6s)]
*  which never happened, I hit the forward assist [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=681.72s)]
*  to close the ejection port [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=683.9599999999999s)]
*  and he sees me doing that or something [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=687.16s)]
*  and this time he runs at me [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  and he has his gun pointed directly at my head. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=691.52s)]
*  Did you see the gun? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=694.04s)]
*  I did. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=695.04s)]
*  Do you think he was gonna shoot you? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=697.76s)]
*  I did. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=699.0s)]
*  He had it pointed directly at my head [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=700.92s)]
*  and that's when I shoot him one time [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=703.16s)]
*  and he is no longer a threat to me at that point [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=704.92s)]
*  because he ran off after I fired that shot. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=709.52s)]
*  Did you realize you hit him? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=712.36s)]
*  I didn't know until later. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=714.76s)]
*  So then what happens? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=717.24s)]
*  There is a person directly in front of me [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=719.48s)]
*  and I point my rifle in their direction [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  and he puts his hands up and he's backing up [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=724.6s)]
*  and I then turn around, start going to the police [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=729.12s)]
*  and then I hear shots behind me [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=733.36s)]
*  and I turn around and briefly raise my rifle [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=735.08s)]
*  to see if I'm being shot at [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=737.48s)]
*  and then I realize I can't see who's shooting at me [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=739.64s)]
*  so then I turn around and go back to the police car [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=742.24s)]
*  towards the police line. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=745.84s)]
*  It's just, hearing this, it's just hard to believe [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=748.16s)]
*  this is happening in an American city. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=749.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=752.4s)]
*  So then you finally get up, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=753.76s)]
*  you hear shots, you turn to see who's shooting at you [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=757.04s)]
*  and then you finally make it to the police line. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=760.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=762.6800000000001s)]
*  Once I make it to the police cruiser, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=764.2s)]
*  the police officer says, get back, get back, get back. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=768.2s)]
*  One of them has a gun out [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=772.48s)]
*  and the other has pepper spray pointed at me [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=773.76s)]
*  and I say, hey, I just had to shoot somebody, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=776.36s)]
*  I just had to shoot somebody [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=777.96s)]
*  and then they say, go home and I didn't know this until. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  Go home? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=783.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=783.82s)]
*  The officer said to go home. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=785.0s)]
*  I don't think he knew what happened or heard me. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=786.28s)]
*  There's a lot of chaos going on. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=788.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=790.64s)]
*  But apparently he pepper sprayed me. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=792.32s)]
*  You can see it in the video [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=795.2s)]
*  but I don't remember being pepper sprayed by him. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=796.04s)]
*  So then what happened? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=799.52s)]
*  I say, okay, I go back to the car source lot number two. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=801.5600000000001s)]
*  We've been referring to them. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=806.6800000000001s)]
*  Car source one is the one that got burnt down. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=807.84s)]
*  Car source two is the one that I was at primarily [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=810.6s)]
*  the entire night and car source three is the one [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=813.32s)]
*  where I was attacked by Mr. Rosenbaum. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=815.8000000000001s)]
*  I go back to car source lot number two [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=818.64s)]
*  and I tell everybody there what happened. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=821.62s)]
*  I said, I had to do it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=824.84s)]
*  I was just attacked. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=826.0s)]
*  I was dizzy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  I was vomiting. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=829.02s)]
*  I couldn't breathe. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=831.44s)]
*  And I was like, I wanted to turn myself into Kenosha [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=832.9200000000001s)]
*  but I wasn't able to because they weren't accepting visitors [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=839.64s)]
*  apparently with the barricades and the fence up. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=843.48s)]
*  So we ended up turning myself [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=846.84s)]
*  into the Antioch Police Department. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=848.34s)]
*  So you drove back across state lines [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=850.28s)]
*  as we're now calling it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  You couldn't even turn yourself in. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=856.2s)]
*  No. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=858.76s)]
*  I had to go to Antioch Police Department [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=860.36s)]
*  which to my understanding is the closest [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=862.9200000000001s)]
*  police department to Kenosha. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=865.72s)]
*  Why do you think people were burning car source? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=867.9200000000001s)]
*  What does that have to do with civil rights? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=870.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=872.08s)]
*  I think it was opportunists taking advantage [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=873.52s)]
*  of the BLM movement. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=876.0600000000001s)]
*  I agree with the BLM movement. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=877.46s)]
*  I agree everybody has a right to protest and assemble [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=880.32s)]
*  but I do not agree that people have the right to burn down. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=882.88s)]
*  I don't appreciate that people are burning down [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=886.28s)]
*  in American cities to try to spread their message. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=890.12s)]
*  I think there's other ways to go around and do that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=892.6s)]
*  Well, I agree with that completely. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=895.44s)]
*  So you turn yourself into Antioch Police. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=897.48s)]
*  What do you think's gonna happen at that point to you? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=899.08s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=903.48s)]
*  I was in shock. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=904.92s)]
*  My head was spinning from being hit [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  in the head multiple times. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=908.52s)]
*  I had some minor injuries. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=909.76s)]
*  I just didn't know. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  I didn't know I was gonna be arrested [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=915.28s)]
*  for defending myself because everything was on video. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=917.12s)]
*  But part of the reason I think I was arrested [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=920.08s)]
*  is because of the mob mentality. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=922.0s)]
*  And they were like, oh yeah, we're just gonna arrest him [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=924.4s)]
*  even though there was videos already out [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=930.2s)]
*  showing me being attacked and having to defend myself. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=932.16s)]
*  So when was it that you were arrested? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=935.4s)]
*  I was arrested on August 25th at around 6 a.m. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=937.96s)]
*  I was formally arrested without a criminal complaint [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=943.1s)]
*  being drafted. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=946.04s)]
*  They didn't know what they were charging me with yet. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=947.12s)]
*  They just arrested me. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=949.36s)]
*  At home? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=950.8s)]
*  At Antioch Police Department. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=951.68s)]
*  What'd your parents say when you called them [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=954.28s)]
*  and told them what had happened? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=955.52s)]
*  I didn't call my mom after I saw her [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=956.72s)]
*  and she was in shock. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=958.64s)]
*  She was like, she wanted to go into hiding [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=960.0s)]
*  and I said, no, the right thing to do [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=962.76s)]
*  would be to turn myself in. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=964.2s)]
*  I didn't do anything wrong. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=965.6s)]
*  So you knew that from the very beginning? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=968.28s)]
*  I knew that. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=970.2s)]
*  A lot of people are like, oh, Kyle had time [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=971.84s)]
*  to meet with his attorneys to come up [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=974.04s)]
*  with this amazing defense of self-defense. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=976.48s)]
*  No, that's not the case. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=978.52s)]
*  This has been 100% self-defense from the beginning [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=979.7199999999999s)]
*  and I didn't know there was 100 cameras. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=982.9599999999999s)]
*  I knew, but I did know I was attacked [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=985.4399999999999s)]
*  and I defended myself. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=987.48s)]
*  What do you think would have happened to you [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  if there hadn't been the amount of video that there is? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=990.9599999999999s)]
*  I can't even imagine. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=994.24s)]
*  I don't think we'd be sitting here right now [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=995.48s)]
*  having this talk, Tucker. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=997.24s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  You'd never get out. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1001.76s)]
*  Rittenhouse knows perfectly well the only reason he's free [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1004.8399999999999s)]
*  is because he can prove what actually happened [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1007.24s)]
*  thanks to those videos, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1009.12s)]
*  but it didn't prevent him from going to jail anyway. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1010.24s)]
*  He did for a longer period than most people understand. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1012.56s)]
*  During that time, he picked up a couple of attorneys [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1015.5999999999999s)]
*  who said they would help him. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1018.04s)]
*  In his view, they badly abused him [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1019.7199999999999s)]
*  and his family and their trust. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1022.24s)]
*  I'll tell you a lot about that in just a minute [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1024.8s)]
*  and about the prosecutors. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1026.8799999999999s)]
*  Also, a programming note, we had cameras behind the scenes [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  throughout much of this case. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1030.92s)]
*  Our Tucker Carlson Originals documentary [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7sbWaZstQ&t=1032.6s)]
