# Tucker: This is impossible to imagine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM)
*  Harmeet Dhillon has followed all of this closely from the inside. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=0.0s)]
*  She's the founder of the Dhillon Law Group. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=3.2s)]
*  Harmeet, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  So let's start with a specific question, Germaine, to the race, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=6.36s)]
*  in which Donald Trump is engaged. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=10.4s)]
*  He's the front runner by 30 points. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=12.0s)]
*  You have seen cases, politicized cases, as with Roger Stone, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=14.36s)]
*  in which the person charged is gagged by the judge [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  and not allowed to speak about the charges. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=20.96s)]
*  This is increasingly common, a violation of the First Amendment, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=23.76s)]
*  obviously, but it happens. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  If this happens to Donald Trump, he will lose his free speech rights [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=29.16s)]
*  as a candidate in a presidential race. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  And I'm just wondering if you think that could potentially happen. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=36.6s)]
*  Well, it very much could happen. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  In fact, we've seen it talked about on television already. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=43.52s)]
*  And in fact, the president has been subject to similar, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  former president, subject to similar allegations [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  in other litigation that he's involved in, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=51.96s)]
*  also way beyond the statute of limitations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=54.16s)]
*  The story is that because he says mean things about people sometimes [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=56.68s)]
*  on his free speech platforms, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=60.72s)]
*  that he should not be allowed to speak about a fundamental issue of due process [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=63.32s)]
*  that governs the future of our country and how we look at justice [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=67.68s)]
*  and how we look at the politicization of this political process. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=71.76s)]
*  And so that would be a gross miscarriage of justice if it occurs. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=75.8s)]
*  And I would not be surprised to see this politicized prosecutor [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=79.64s)]
*  make that request of this judge. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=84.04s)]
*  I honestly think it's impossible to imagine greater election interference, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=87.36000000000001s)]
*  a greater or more aggressive attack on our democracy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=92.2s)]
*  than gagging a presidential candidate in a presidential year. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=95.68s)]
*  I mean, Vladimir Putin has never dreamed of any attack [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=100.48s)]
*  on the United States more damaging than that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  Would anyone be able to stop it? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=109.28s)]
*  Well, certainly the lawyers in this case will argue against that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=110.68s)]
*  And it may be the kind of issue that they seek an immediate appeal on if they lose. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  But at the end of the day, if a court sets those rules, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  then, you know, litigant has to abide by them or be in contempt of court. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, that itself would be a very dangerous course to pursue. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  And so... [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=130.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=131.52s)]
*  No matter which way you cut it, this entire case, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=132.52s)]
*  from its inception to its continuation, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=135.44s)]
*  to its now being brought to fruition, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=138.88s)]
*  what we hear from The New York Times, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=142.04s)]
*  not from anything that the DA's office has told the defense team, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=144.64s)]
*  is that there are 30-plus charges. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  We don't know what they are. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=150.28s)]
*  The New York Times knows what they are. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=152.04s)]
*  And so this is not the way that justice is meant to go in the United States. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=154.04s)]
*  And what I'm afraid of, Tucker, is that this isn't just going to be about Donald Trump. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=158.64s)]
*  It's going to undermine all citizens' confidence in the rule of law in this country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=164.88s)]
*  And that is really tragic. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=169.52s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  And it has far-reaching and lasting generational consequences [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  that I don't think anyone's thought through. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=176.72s)]
*  Harmeet Dhillon, I appreciate your wise and measured perspective, as always. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=178.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=182.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDbm2mzCohM&t=194.84s)]
