# Polish president to Tucker: Family is the foundation of every nation
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI)
*  As we look around the United States, we often think, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=0.0s)]
*  has a better country ever been led by worse people? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=2.24s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  So in our spare time, we've looked around the world. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=8.44s)]
*  We try from time to time to bring leaders on this show [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=10.44s)]
*  from other countries who actually care about their people. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=12.96s)]
*  That's why we went to Hungary this summer [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=16.84s)]
*  to talk to Viktor Orban. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=18.36s)]
*  But he's not the only one. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=20.32s)]
*  When we spoke to Orban, he mentioned other countries [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=22.12s)]
*  in Central Europe that have defended their populations [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=25.12s)]
*  against international interference. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=28.56s)]
*  And one of the countries he mentioned was Poland. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=30.4s)]
*  In the last few nights in Budapest, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=33.32s)]
*  I've run into a number of Americans who have come here [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=35.16s)]
*  because they want to be around people who agree with them, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=38.36s)]
*  who agree with you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Do you see Budapest as a kind of capital [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=43.44s)]
*  of this kind of thinking? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=47.56s)]
*  The capital of that kind of thinking [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=49.72s)]
*  or one of the capitals, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=51.92s)]
*  because the other Central European countries [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=52.92s)]
*  are also very competitive and producing very nice ideas [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=54.68s)]
*  and organizing that kind of communities of conservative [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=58.64s)]
*  and Christian Democrats thinkers as we do. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=61.92s)]
*  Andrei Duda is the president of Poland [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=66.64s)]
*  and we're honored to be joined by him right now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=68.76s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=71.16s)]
*  We know that you're watching what's happening [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=73.32s)]
*  in the United States and you're watching this massive flow [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=75.08s)]
*  of migrants over our border. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=77.68s)]
*  It will total over a million just this year. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=79.84s)]
*  Something very similar happened to Europe in 2015. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=82.36s)]
*  The EU pressured Poland and other nations [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=85.64s)]
*  in Central Europe to accept and Poland fought back. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=88.24s)]
*  Tell us why you did that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  The answer is very simple. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  We did not agree back then in 2015 [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=95.96s)]
*  to the so-called quota system, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  which was proposed by some of the EU member states, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  which means that every single country [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=103.28s)]
*  would have to accept a given number of migrants. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  And we gave a very clear answer to that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=107.88s)]
*  Whoever wants to come to Poland, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  whoever's looking for help, assistance, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=111.16s)]
*  especially refugees who are looking for shelter [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=113.44s)]
*  because they are threatened by war, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=115.52s)]
*  persecuted in their own countries. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=117.32s)]
*  If they want to come to Poland, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=119.32s)]
*  we want them to stay in Poland, live in Poland. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, to accept such a person and to help them, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=124.24s)]
*  we did not agree to relocate Poland people by force. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  We do not agree to keep these people in prison. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=130.68s)]
*  If these people did not want to stay in Poland, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=133.0s)]
*  they would want to leave. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=135.44s)]
*  And we're not going to make anybody stay. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=136.56s)]
*  We're not going to keep anybody against their will. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=138.56s)]
*  The American president, Joe Biden, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=140.84s)]
*  before he became president, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=143.12s)]
*  described Poland as unfree, as an authoritarian place. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=144.56s)]
*  How have your dealings with the Biden administration been [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=150.24s)]
*  since he's become president? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  What you just said is indeed very regrettable thing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  because there are a lot of lies spread about Poland. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=157.36s)]
*  And the first and foremost, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=159.4s)]
*  what some representatives of the Polish opposition are saying [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  about the current Polish government is totally untrue. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=163.44s)]
*  And the best proof of that is in the fact [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  that the incumbent government has won the election. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  They won the election back in 2019. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  I simply said, people are happy with their government right now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=172.64s)]
*  They think that this government cares for their interests, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=175.68s)]
*  that this government keeps electoral promises. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=177.68s)]
*  And this is why they were reelected. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=179.76s)]
*  But of course, some representatives of the opposition [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=181.44s)]
*  are really furious because they're not able to win elections. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=183.44s)]
*  As I said, they lost twice in a row. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=186.64s)]
*  They also lost the presidential election. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=188.88s)]
*  So because of that, they're slandering [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=190.6s)]
*  the current political camp. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=192.0s)]
*  But let me reiterate, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=194.16s)]
*  fortunately, it is the people who choose. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=195.24s)]
*  Finally, let me ask you about Poland's family policy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=197.6s)]
*  So Poland, from the outside, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=201.44s)]
*  appears to have decided to help encourage [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=203.0s)]
*  Polish couples to have children. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=205.64s)]
*  Please tell us what you're doing and why you've done it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=207.88s)]
*  The Constitution stipulates that marriage, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=210.76s)]
*  it says a union of a man and a woman and family [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=212.68s)]
*  are protected by the government in a special way. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=214.96s)]
*  So the first time since 1989, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=217.16s)]
*  we have embarked upon a very resolute [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=219.28s)]
*  and vast pro-family action. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=220.96s)]
*  And when I was running for president back in 2015, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=222.92s)]
*  I also made a pledge, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=225.56s)]
*  and I said that we would start a pro-family policy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=226.68s)]
*  We offered, we actually announced myself during the campaign, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=229.28s)]
*  and later I was joined by my colleagues [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  who were also running for the parliamentary election. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  So we pledged that we'd introduce a program [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=236.52s)]
*  by the name of 500 Plus. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=238.36s)]
*  It is a welfare program for families [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  in its initial version. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=241.96s)]
*  We were testing, actually. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=243.36s)]
*  We decided that starting from the second child in a family, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=244.56s)]
*  parents of every child monthly receive 500 zloty, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=247.4s)]
*  some of $130, a kind of welfare for many [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  from the state in raising children. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  This program was revolutionized in Poland. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  I think nobody can imagine [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=259.6s)]
*  not to have the 500 Plus program in Poland. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=261.16s)]
*  That was the best thing, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=263.48s)]
*  definitely the best social program [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=264.48s)]
*  that we have been able to introduce. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=265.72s)]
*  But to me, a politician, speaking openly, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=268.12s)]
*  I consider myself to be rather conservative. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=270.92s)]
*  And I actually was always frank about my views. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm a practicing Christian. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=275.72s)]
*  I pray, I'm not ashamed of that whatsoever. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=277.72s)]
*  And to me, the value of family is priceless. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=280.24s)]
*  I do support families. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=282.48s)]
*  I'm pro-life, I defend life. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=283.56s)]
*  I believe that life is sacred. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  I believe it should be guarded. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  And families have to be supported as strong as they can [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=288.76s)]
*  because family is the foundation of every nation. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  Everything is based on family. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=293.56s)]
*  Therefore, the support with which we offer families [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  from the political perspective, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=297.48s)]
*  from my personal perspective, is key importance. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=298.64s)]
*  We also have used other programs supporting families. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=301.44s)]
*  We support parents with their child starting schools [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=303.68s)]
*  with programs dubbed 300 Zloty. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  So we pay 300 Zloty to the parents of every child [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=308.48s)]
*  going to school to buy a set of books, a rust sack, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=310.92s)]
*  and pens, pencils, stationery, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=313.76s)]
*  whatever the child needs starting school. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=315.68s)]
*  That is a very difficult moment when the school year begins. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=317.44s)]
*  We know that families have to spend more money, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=319.96s)]
*  so it turned out that 300 Zloty is important [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=321.76s)]
*  for the families. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=324.24s)]
*  And it also contributes quite big support [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=325.44s)]
*  on top of the 500 plus, which every family gets per child. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=327.88s)]
*  It's inspiring to hear that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  I wish we had it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for sitting down [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=432KFteKiiI&t=334.36s)]
