# Biden administration facing a 'landmark lawsuit': Missouri AG
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc)
*  So that was Nina Jankiewicz, we just told you, the head of the Ministry of Truth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=0.0s)]
*  Already she's being sued, by the way. The states of Missouri and Louisiana have just filed a lawsuit [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=3.6s)]
*  against the administration, including officials like Jankiewicz, for colluding with big tech to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=8.0s)]
*  censor speech, which they are doing. The Biden administration does it in public. They've repeatedly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  called on Facebook, Twitter, other platforms to censor opinions that are critical of them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=17.28s)]
*  Eric Schmidt is the attorney general of Missouri. He's the top law enforcement in that state. He's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=22.88s)]
*  joined the suit. He joins us tonight. Mr. Attorney General, thanks so much for coming on. Tell us why [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  you're suing. Well, look, we're taking on, we're fighting back against the two of the most powerful [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  and corrupt institutions that are out there, big government and big tech, for colluding, working [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=36.16s)]
*  together to suppress speech. And they do it in a couple different ways, Tucker. They hold over these [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=40.4s)]
*  special protections like Section 230 protections, unless they censor more. They also have been very [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  outspoken. Jen Psaki's talked about how they're flagging posts now, in July of last year, flagging [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  posts for Facebook as disinformation. So they're working directly with them. We know that. And then [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=55.28s)]
*  now this newest Orwellian chapter, this dystopian chapter of the Ministry of Truth, I mean, you have [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=60.4s)]
*  Mary Poppins in charge of this thing, I guess, now. And that would be like putting, by the way, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=67.6s)]
*  Corella DeVille in charge of managing an animal shelter. It's a total disaster. Okay. These folks [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=72.48s)]
*  are nuts. They're intent on suppressing speech that they don't like, calling it disinformation, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=78.48s)]
*  misinformation. So we're filing a lawsuit. And Tucker, you talk about this all the time. The [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=83.28s)]
*  reality is, individuals have a right to speak their mind. This is at the core of the American [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=88.16s)]
*  experiment, that this is a God-given right. Government's there to protect those rights, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=92.8s)]
*  not to tell you what you can say and when you can say it. So this lawsuit, it's a landmark lawsuit. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=97.28s)]
*  We're going directly after the collusion. They're working together to suppress speech, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=101.44s)]
*  and we're fighting back. So just as quick as a constitutional matter, government cannot [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=105.68s)]
*  encourage censorship. That's a direct, I mean, we know that through the Supreme Court, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=110.24s)]
*  many ruling servitors, that's a violation of the First Amendment, correct? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=114.16s)]
*  Yep, that's exactly right. And what we're arguing in this case, Tucker, is that they're outsourcing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  that. The government is outsourcing the censorship to their big tech partners. They're flagging it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  And by the way, they're terrified. When we get into discovery here and find out how Gensaki and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=126.8s)]
*  Fauci and Mary Poppins here are working with the big tech partners, what they're asking, what they're [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  telling them to take down, we know it's the laptop from hell. We know it's the origins of COVID. We [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=138.32s)]
*  know it's the ineffectiveness of mass. We know all of these things that they've been working with them [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=143.04s)]
*  on, and this lawsuit will help bring those to light and expose it, and that's why it's an important [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=148.72s)]
*  case. Mr. Attorney General, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Good luck. Thank you. Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=152.88s)]
*  Good night. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRXI2rTbXc&t=168.32s)]
