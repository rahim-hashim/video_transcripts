# Rittenhouse prosecution has 'made itself an issue': Legal scholar
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI)
*  So the prosecution spent most of the Rittenhouse trial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=0.0s)]
*  undermining its own case, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=2.84s)]
*  and its closing argument today [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  was no different than that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=6.48s)]
*  How badly did it go? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=7.48s)]
*  We'll take a look at this picture. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=8.32s)]
*  At one point, the prosecutor pointed an AR-15 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=9.5s)]
*  directly at jurors with his finger on the trigger, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=12.96s)]
*  which, newsflash, you're not supposed to do. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=15.84s)]
*  Keep your finger off the trigger, son. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=18.44s)]
*  By contrast, the closing argument from the defense, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=20.56s)]
*  while not perfect, went a little more smoothly. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  The defense attorney, Mark Richards, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=25.94s)]
*  chose his words very carefully. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=27.26s)]
*  He explained that Kyle Rittenhouse has a right [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=28.74s)]
*  not to be, quote, molested by Joseph Rosenbaum. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=30.58s)]
*  He has as much right to go there [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=35.26s)]
*  as anybody else in the city of Kenosha [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=38.46s)]
*  and be unmolested by the likes of Joseph Rosenbaum, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=41.739999999999995s)]
*  Kelly, and Joshua Zeminski. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=47.86s)]
*  Jonathan Turley is a professor [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=51.78s)]
*  at George Washington University Law School. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=52.78s)]
*  He joins us today, having watched the trial. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=54.42s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=56.62s)]
*  I've got a million questions, don't have time for many. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  Here's the first. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=59.9s)]
*  So we learned today that, actually, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=60.94s)]
*  it's legal in the state of Wisconsin [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  for a 17-year-old to have a long gun, as Rittenhouse did. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=64.34s)]
*  Why did we not find that out till the last day of the trial? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=68.34s)]
*  This charge stood until today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=70.74s)]
*  That's an excellent question. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=74.3s)]
*  I wrote a column that actually questioned [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=75.58s)]
*  why this count was allowed into the trial. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=78.58s)]
*  I'm baffled how the prosecutors [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=82.42s)]
*  got an indictment on this count. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=84.74s)]
*  From my view, this has no applicability to the case. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=87.94s)]
*  This was not a short-barreled weapon. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  You can determine that with a simple measurement. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  And then the other alternative conditions [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  are not met by him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  And so I'm not sure what the prosecutors said [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=100.02s)]
*  that got the indictment, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  but the court eventually did throw that out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=104.82s)]
*  But part of the problem here is that an oral, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=107.62s)]
*  an opening statement is like an oral contract with a jury. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=110.34s)]
*  They take it very seriously. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=113.66s)]
*  When you say you're gonna show something, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=114.86s)]
*  they expect you to show it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=117.61999999999999s)]
*  When you say that Rittenhouse chased down Rosenblum [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=118.38s)]
*  and shot him in the back, they expect to see it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, they didn't. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, they saw one count drop, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  and a number of the assertions made in the opening statement [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=129.98s)]
*  were gone by the closing argument. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=132.98s)]
*  So there was this super weird moment, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=136.78s)]
*  I honestly don't know what to make of it, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=139.1s)]
*  where the prosecutor today in his closing remarks said, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  look, Joseph Rosenblum didn't really do anything. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  He set some fires, yeah, he moved obstructions in the road, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=146.98s)]
*  yeah, he screamed the N-word. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  Why would the prosecutor remind the jury [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=153.7s)]
*  the guy was setting fires and screaming racial slurs? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=156.42s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=158.82s)]
*  Yeah, the prosecution could not be working harder [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=161.26s)]
*  for acquittal. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=164.1s)]
*  I mean, you have a jury from Kenosha, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=164.94s)]
*  and you're mocking the notion that, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=167.78s)]
*  oh, they set a few fires. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=170.18s)]
*  They rioted a little. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=173.54s)]
*  During questioning, Binger said, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  it made fun of the fact that they were throwing bricks [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  at police cruisers and saying, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  yeah, they really hurt those cruisers, did they? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=183.14s)]
*  And you can only imagine what it's like [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=185.98s)]
*  to be a Kenosha juror sitting there and saying, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=187.62s)]
*  whose counsel are you? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=190.62s)]
*  Who are you representing here? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=192.29999999999998s)]
*  Kenosha's already a forgotten town [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=194.89999999999998s)]
*  that will never, never be rebuilt. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=196.38s)]
*  I mean, if you live there, this is not a small thing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=198.38s)]
*  We just, I have to ask you, I hate to put you on the spot, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=200.1s)]
*  what do you think is gonna happen with this jury? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=201.98s)]
*  Well, I think the prosecution has reduced the range [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  of possibilities, very likely, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=208.1s)]
*  between a hung jury and outright acquittal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=209.98s)]
*  The problem is you make yourself an issue. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=213.66s)]
*  That's what Binger has done. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=215.62s)]
*  He has contradicted his statements so often, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=218.18s)]
*  presented evidence that was not borne out. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=221.02s)]
*  He's really begging for reaction from this jury, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  but I would be very surprised [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=228.1s)]
*  if they could eke out a single conviction [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=230.22s)]
*  on this rather appalling record. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=232.3s)]
*  Yeah, as a non-lawyer, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=235.34s)]
*  that's certainly the way it seems to me, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=236.54s)]
*  so it's nice to have that instinct confirmed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=237.82s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=239.9s)]
*  Jonathan Turley with us tonight. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51ouBlsdkI&t=240.74s)]
