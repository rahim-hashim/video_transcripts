# Palm Springs mayor pushing to pay transgender and nonbinary residents
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ)
*  Jason Rantz is a radio show host up in Seattle. He has that story for us tonight. Hey, Jason. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, Tucker. The country's WOCUS guaranteed income scheme is coming from Palm Springs, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=3.6s)]
*  run by Lisa Middleton. This is the state's first transgender mayor. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=10.24s)]
*  The plan is effectively meant to help prevent homelessness by giving 20 residents somewhere [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=14.16s)]
*  between $600 and $900 a month for nearly two years. And they can spend the money however it is they [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=18.8s)]
*  want. There's no strings attached. The only rule at this point is that the recipients have to be [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=23.92s)]
*  transgender or pretend they're genderless or have multiple genders based on one's mood. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=28.8s)]
*  Gender doesn't actually mean anything anymore, and this is not something that really you can prove. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=36.08s)]
*  So instead of primarily focusing on using this to end poverty, there's been this focus on paying [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=40.4s)]
*  for what's called gender-affirming health care, which includes elective surgeries and hormone [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=46.64s)]
*  treatment. Now, the city hopes to use some of a $35 million budget set up by California Democrats [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=50.88s)]
*  to fund various pilot programs around the state. But big picture, this is really a movement by a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=56.08s)]
*  group called Mayors for Guaranteed Income. They think that redistribution of wealth actually [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  solves poverty. It's backed by folks like Jack Dorsey, who tried to ruin the world with Twitter. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=66.32s)]
*  Now he's set on another pretty dangerous idea. Here's one Palm Springs council member [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=70.48s)]
*  inadvertently pointing out that this is pretty much a huge scam. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=75.12s)]
*  The bureaucracies that we've set up to fund poverty programs and to staff them [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=78.96s)]
*  are probably much more expensive than giving people the money who need it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=85.36s)]
*  Now she goes on to point out that this is really just about getting the data necessary to prove that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=91.84s)]
*  this whole scheme works. But much like the people it's supposed to help in Palm Springs, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=97.92s)]
*  guaranteed income presents as a good idea. It's not actually a good one. And all the data seems [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=103.12s)]
*  to point out that it doesn't quite get us to the point of defeating poverty in a way that is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=108.08s)]
*  efficient with the use of funding. It's just too expensive. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=114.72s)]
*  Well, and of course it just reflects elite concerns. I mean, you know, we had 100,000 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  people die of drug ODs last year. Like, why don't, you know, if we're passing out money, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=122.16s)]
*  how about their families? No, they're not fashionable. Gotta be non-binary. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=125.44s)]
*  Not for treatment, of course. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=128.16s)]
*  Whatever that is. Jason Reyes, great to see you tonight. Thank you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHR-4w25zQ&t=129.12s)]
