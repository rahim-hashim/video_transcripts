# Tucker Carlson: This is true insanity
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, it used to be before liberals [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=1.92s)]
*  embraced authoritarianism, that they would talk a lot about rights. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=4.0s)]
*  You're right. My right. Everything was a right. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=7.2s)]
*  A right to health care. Miranda rights. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=10.0s)]
*  You can debate whether those are rights or not. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=12.64s)]
*  But if you're talking about rights, you at some point want to identify [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=14.88s)]
*  the most basic human right of all. What is that? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=17.76s)]
*  Well, of course, it's the right of self-defense. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=19.44s)]
*  That's the essential right upon which all other rights depend. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=21.44s)]
*  If you can't defend yourself, you can't defend your family and your property, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=25.76s)]
*  you don't have any rights at all. You're a slave by definition. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=28.88s)]
*  So you may be wondering in this moment of creeping authoritarianism, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=32.56s)]
*  how is the right to self-defense doing in our country? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=36.4s)]
*  We could give some kind of long lecture, but instead, how about some examples? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=40.08s)]
*  Consider two shootings that took place at gas stations in the past year in the United States. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  The first shooting occurred around 2 p.m. on October 6th in the state of Missouri. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=48.08s)]
*  A 23-year-old felon called J. Von Taylor, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=52.56s)]
*  with a long criminal record, convictions for armed robbery, for example, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=55.12s)]
*  began threatening a female clerk, apparently because the gas station [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=59.28s)]
*  didn't carry the kind of cigars that he wanted. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=62.08s)]
*  That's when an off-duty fireman called Anthony Santi, who was inside, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  decided to step in. He told J. Von Taylor to leave the store. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=68.88s)]
*  Well, in response to that, Taylor began threatening him and then ran toward his SUV outside. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=72.88s)]
*  Santi followed him outside because he suspected that J. Von Taylor would retrieve a gun from the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=77.36s)]
*  car, and that's exactly what he did. J. Von Taylor pulled in a legal handgun with an extended [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=82.08s)]
*  magazine from his SUV. Santi, not wanting to get shot, put Taylor in a headlock, and that's when [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=86.72s)]
*  J. Von Taylor handed the gun to his girlfriend, and his girlfriend shot the unarmed fireman in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=94.24s)]
*  the back, killing him. It was an execution. It's not a close call. The footage is online. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=99.6s)]
*  We're not going to show it to you because it's awful, but if you have any doubt, you can watch it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=104.32s)]
*  So there's no debate about what happened here, and yet the local social justice DA, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=109.12s)]
*  Gene Peters Baker, refused to press charges against the person who killed the firefighter. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, why? Well, there may have been a political component, and we know that because online, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=121.28s)]
*  BLM activists immediately celebrated the killing on racial grounds. J. Von Taylor was black. Anthony [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=125.92s)]
*  Santi was white. That was enough for them. They're glad he's dead. Now consider the second gas station [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=131.84s)]
*  shooting. This one happened just before midnight, less than a month ago in Austin, Texas. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=137.52s)]
*  An armed man with a long criminal record called Mark Quease Demps walked into a shell station and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  became violent. Here's a report from the local Fox station describing what happened next. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=146.88s)]
*  Customers who frequent the family-owned Shell gas station on East MLK in Springdale can't say [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=152.0s)]
*  enough good things about 25-year-old employee Yaseen Naz. They're stunned to hear Naz is charged with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=158.0s)]
*  first degree murder after police say he shot and killed 42-year-old Marquis Demps outside the store [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=164.32s)]
*  late Saturday night. According to court documents, Demps came into the store and caused a verbal [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=170.4s)]
*  disturbance that turned physical. That there was some type of altercation happening inside the store, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=175.44s)]
*  and that's what started everything. Demps waving a knife at the workers, so Naz grabbed a gun, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  telling him to leave. Instead, Demps began trashing the store. Naz's father showing us [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=187.12s)]
*  the damaged merchandise and display cases, the credit card machine ripped out of the counter. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=192.56s)]
*  As Demps left, Naz followed him into the parking lot and shot it multiple times through his car window. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=198.08s)]
*  So a guy with a criminal record and a knife in his hand starts trashing your store and then runs [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=206.32s)]
*  outside to his car. You see, Naz told police later that he shot Marquis Demps because he feared for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=212.8s)]
*  his life. He thought the guy was going to get a gun and come back and kill him. And that's a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=218.56s)]
*  reasonable fear, of course. The Anthony Santis murder demonstrates that it is. But in this case, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=222.32s)]
*  the DA, a Soros-funded anti-police political activist called Jose Garza, is pressing charges [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=227.84s)]
*  against the clerk. He wants Yaseen Naz, a man who is widely respected in his community, a man who [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=234.08s)]
*  actually contributes to our society, as you just heard, he's trying to send that man to prison for [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=239.44s)]
*  the rest of his life. So butt these two cases together. Consider them in tandem. What's the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=244.4s)]
*  message? Well, the message is if a violent felon starts terrorizing people in your store, ripping [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=250.4s)]
*  your store apart, on which you rely for your livelihood, you can't do anything. If he goes [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=255.36s)]
*  back to his car to get a gun, you have to let it happen. So get shot or go to jail for the rest of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=261.04s)]
*  your life. Those are your choices, which of course are not really choices at all. And these are not [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=267.36s)]
*  isolated cases that we cherry pick to make some polemical point. It's happening everywhere. We saw [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=271.6s)]
*  it happen to Jose Alba last summer in New York. He's the bodega clerk. The prosecutor is sent to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  Rikers Island on a murder charge because he fought back when a thug, another convicted felon, attacked [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  him with his girlfriend in the store. Now that charge was ultimately dropped after the public [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  flipped out because it was so unfair. But Alba left this country for the Dominican Republic because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  he saw where things are going. Self-defense, the cornerstone of all freedoms, without which you cannot [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=298.0s)]
*  be free, you are owned, self-defense is becoming illegal in effect in a lot of places. And not just [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=305.28s)]
*  in very liberal places like New York City, even in states with some of the strongest self-defense laws [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=312.48s)]
*  on the books. Arizona, for example, allows residents to shoot trespassers on their property. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=318.32s)]
*  So 73-year-old George Allen Kelly lived right on the border. Now you may have heard that Joe Biden [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=324.0s)]
*  opened the border to millions and millions of people from other countries whose identities we [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=329.2s)]
*  don't know to just walk in. So if you live on the border, this has changed your life completely and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  it scared you. So George Allen Kelly was one of those people, lives on the border. He's seeing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=340.56s)]
*  this firsthand. Now he is in jail tonight charged with first-degree murder because he shot an illegal [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=346.0s)]
*  alien who trespassed onto his ranch in Kino Springs. That's less than two miles from the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=351.84s)]
*  border. This happened January 30th, just the other day. Now we don't know the details of the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=356.56s)]
*  altercation between the man in prison and the man he killed, but the man in prison has no record [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  of killing anyone else. He's not a convicted felon. He does not have a violent history. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=370.4s)]
*  The man he killed was an illegal migrant called Gabriel Cuen Butima and he was deported several [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  times from the United States but let back in. We're not attacking him, just noting him. That's true. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=381.04s)]
*  So George Allen Kelly apparently felt threatened and shot that illegal migrant, but prosecutors [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  did not give him the benefit of the doubt. They instantly charged him with first-degree murder. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  So here he is, George Allen Kelly. This is the guy who according to Arizona authorities is a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=396.48s)]
*  dangerous risk to public safety who must spend the rest of his life in prison. Assess, does he seem [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  dangerous to you? I noticed coming in, your honor, my wife is present in the court. May I ask her to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=406.16s)]
*  make an appointment for an audiovisual conference and I've not been able to talk to her or anyone. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=415.44s)]
*  So that's something that has to be discussed with the detention facility downstairs. So that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=423.68s)]
*  conversation would have to be had with them, sir. Okay, so if your wife wants to have communication [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=429.44000000000005s)]
*  with you, she can go to the sheriff's office and they can go ahead and make the proper [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=434.8s)]
*  accommodation that they need to make. I appreciate you giving that instruction. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=438.0s)]
*  This is an elderly man who can barely walk, who has never been convicted of a violent crime [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=443.52000000000004s)]
*  and he's being treated like a child by some disembodied voice from some fascist. That's [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  that's what you just saw. Now the judge in this case is called Emilio Velasquez. Now who is [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=454.0s)]
*  Emilio Velasquez? He's a judge. He doesn't have a law degree. He's not a lawyer and yet he's a [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=458.88s)]
*  judge. He's an elected politician and he is allowing the prosecution of an American citizen [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=464.32s)]
*  who exercised his rights under Arizona law and his most basic human right, which is if someone [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=469.36s)]
*  comes onto your property and you feel threatened by it, you have a right to defend yourself by [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=474.32s)]
*  force, period. But Velasquez does not acknowledge that right and so he set the bail for this elderly [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=478.4s)]
*  man whose wife is living alone in their home right near the border at a million dollars. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=485.68s)]
*  So news of this case obviously traveled past Arizona and people were justly outraged by what [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=490.48s)]
*  is being done to this man. So people tried to raise money to pay that bail on GoFundMe. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=497.12s)]
*  But GoFundMe wouldn't allow that. This elderly man rotting in jail while his wife lives alone [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=502.72s)]
*  on a border that the Democratic Party has kept open, you can't raise money for his bail. They [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=507.68s)]
*  shut down GoFundMe, shut down the effort to raise bail for this guy. Now of course you can raise [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=514.32s)]
*  money for BLM as they burn our country down to make sure Donald Trump is not reelected, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=518.8s)]
*  but you're not allowed to raise money for people who are being held on a million dollars bail and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=524.0s)]
*  first degree murder charges for defending their own property along an open border. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=528.4s)]
*  True insanity and a danger to all of us. Even in Texas, which in some places is still a free state, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=533.28s)]
*  self-defense is slowly becoming illegal. A few weeks ago a thug walked into a taco shop holding [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=540.56s)]
*  a gun, scared the hell out of everybody inside and stole their money. He pointed this gun, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  turned out to be fake, at several customers. How would you feel if you were there in the restaurant [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=552.0s)]
*  and some lunatic with a gun starts shoving the barrel in people's faces and stealing their money? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, one brave man stood up and eliminated the threat. Here it is. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=563.04s)]
*  Here it is. A man wearing a mask and gloves inside the taqueria around 1130 Thursday night, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=569.44s)]
*  pointing what looks like a gun at customers while demanding money. As some hide and throw cash, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=577.76s)]
*  this man takes action just as the robber heads to the door still with his gun drawn. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=583.6s)]
*  Picked up the money, turned around and left, and that's when the customer got up and shot him. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=591.2s)]
*  The shooter angry, realizing the robber's gun is plastic. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=595.04s)]
*  Returning the stolen money to customers, taking a sip of his drink and leaving before police arrive. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=602.4s)]
*  So it'd be interesting, and we should do this, play that video for the entire country [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=610.16s)]
*  and let's have a national referendum on what ought to happen to the man [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=615.68s)]
*  who shot the armed robber. You're eating with your family in a restaurant, some lunatic and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=619.76s)]
*  a mask comes in and shoves a gun in your face, what you think is a gun, and steals your money. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=624.72s)]
*  And somebody stands up and shoots him back. What percentage of Americans think that guy should go [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=629.0400000000001s)]
*  to jail? Right around zero, probably. But Houston police, along with the county district attorney, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  are putting that man in front of a grand jury to send him to prison. They're saying he shot the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=640.72s)]
*  criminal one too many times. Okay. It's not hard to see why people are making sure they're putting [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=646.32s)]
*  down violent thugs. If they don't, they'll get out of jail and start terrorizing more people. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=652.4s)]
*  That is happening everywhere. It just happened in Tupelo, Mississippi in September. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  Mississippi is a state controlled by Republicans. But politicians in Mississippi started letting [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=662.48s)]
*  felons out on parole, and that would include a man called Chris Copeland, who's 26. He had multiple [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=666.56s)]
*  convictions for burglary and auto theft. Copeland, while out on probation, executed a clerk inside a [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=671.76s)]
*  chevron after robbing him. He made that clerk, a man called Parmveer Singh, sit down and then [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=677.6s)]
*  shot him in the back of the head. This footage is awful, but it's real. Turn away if you don't want [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  to see it. Here it is. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  Just executed him. So politicians can feel like good and virtuous people by giving a second chance [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=708.48s)]
*  to felons. By the way, felons do deserve a second chance. Not everyone in prison deserves to be [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=716.72s)]
*  there. But when you let people out wholesale and they don't keep track of them, just expect the [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=721.12s)]
*  best, you're going to let psychopaths like Chris Copeland into the general population, and they're [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=726.72s)]
*  going to execute store clerks, who are the last people who deserve to be executed. They're working [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=730.88s)]
*  for like eight bucks an hour to sell you lotto tickets. Meanwhile, people who defend themselves [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=734.56s)]
*  against criminals get the maximum possible sentence. The government gets to defend itself [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=741.04s)]
*  with bodyguards. Politicians have tons of bodyguards you pay for. Congress is so afraid of the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=746.4s)]
*  people they govern, they built a wall around the Capitol this week. But you can't fight back. And [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=751.3599999999999s)]
*  we began to see this accelerate in 2020 during the BLM riots. So a BLM mob broke the gate into Mark [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=756.56s)]
*  and Patricia McCloskey's property in St. Louis. They were having dinner. All of a sudden the mob [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=763.52s)]
*  shows up. And so in response, they did what you would do if you were awake. You grab your firearms, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=767.92s)]
*  you don't shoot anybody back off. Those firearms were lawfully owned. They were on their property, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=773.52s)]
*  as was the mob. Here's what it looked like. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=778.48s)]
*  No! [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=793.52s)]
*  Remember that? They were racist. Right. A group of highly entitled children of [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=798.88s)]
*  orthodontists showed up on their property to threaten them. And they said back off. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=804.56s)]
*  So they're racist, said the Washington Post. And then of course a Soros-backed prosecutor called [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  Kim Gardner charged them, charged the McCloskeys with crime, not the mob, the McCloskeys for daring [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=814.0s)]
*  to defend themselves. Their guns were seized. Now the point of this, of course, is not to make [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=820.56s)]
*  anybody safer. Just the opposite. And St. Louis has not become safer. It's become much more dangerous. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=824.8s)]
*  Under Kim Gardner, the city has experienced its highest murder rate in decades. So public safety is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=830.0s)]
*  not the point. The point is disarming you so you can't defend yourself against their plans for you. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=835.1199999999999s)]
*  Now thankfully, Mark McCloskey and his wife were pardoned [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=842.0s)]
*  these outrageous charges by the governor of the state, thank God. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv26q90nvtA&t=844.8s)]
