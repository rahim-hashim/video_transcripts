# Matt Whitaker on Biden classified docs: 'This is not good for Joe Biden'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU)
*  Matt Whitaker is the former acting attorney general of the United States. He joins us tonight to assess. Mr. Whitaker, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=0.0s)]
*  So explain, if you would, why the Trump case and the Biden case are really not as different as they're telling us on MSNBC. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=7.0s)]
*  Well, they're on the one hand, they aren't different because we're dealing with classified documents and we're dealing with the statute that applies to them and their handling. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=16.0s)]
*  But on the other hand, we're dealing with a former president who had a lot of latitude while president to declassify those documents that were in his possession. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=23.0s)]
*  And Joe Biden, as vice president, had no power to declassify those documents that were in his possession. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=32.0s)]
*  I think it's also interesting fact in this case, Tucker, that the U-Penn documents were in a Manila folder marked personal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=38.0s)]
*  And so you open it up and all these marked classified documents are in a personal folder. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=46.0s)]
*  You know, this this is not good for Joe Biden. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=51.0s)]
*  However, I think ultimately, you know, this is going to get down to where Jim Comey was at with Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=54.0s)]
*  And it's going to come down to a applying the standard of the statute to the facts as we have them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=60.0s)]
*  There's nothing in the statute about locked garages, certainly. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=66.0s)]
*  And there's really nothing about whether or not, you know, you disclosed it as soon as you found it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=71.0s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden had these for to your point over six years. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=77.0s)]
*  Right. So, I mean, whether or not you think this is an organized effort from within the Democratic Party to prevent Biden from running again, I think it's really clear that it is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=81.0s)]
*  I'm still confused as to why we don't know the details. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=89.0s)]
*  Why haven't they told us why they were searching six years later for these documents? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=93.0s)]
*  Who was doing it? Like, what is this and why won't they tell us? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=97.0s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of facts we don't know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=102.0s)]
*  If you remember, famously in the Mar-a-Lago case, they spread out the documents on the carpet, took a picture, sent that to the media, made sure that everyone saw the evidence. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=105.0s)]
*  In this case, we don't know much about the contents of the documents. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=114.0s)]
*  We don't know much about why we were told that it was because he was moving out of the Penn offices and his lawyers were going through the documents. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=118.0s)]
*  But then why go through the garage? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=126.0s)]
*  And really, the other thing that is very concerning about this case is that Mayor Gartner waited four weeks to appoint a special counsel when he knew on December 20th that he had a major problem. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=128.0s)]
*  And they were hoping that this never saw the light of day. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=138.0s)]
*  And that's really a sad fact about this whole case is they didn't want the American people to even know this had happened. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that is, I would say, the definition of corruption. We have a right to know. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=147.0s)]
*  Former acting Attorney General of the United States, Matt Whitaker. Thank you so much. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=151.0s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. Great seeing you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=154.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcwqkENLOU&t=158.0s)]
