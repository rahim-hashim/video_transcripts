# They’re coming after anyone who doesn’t agree with them: Nehls
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM)
*  The Capitol Hill Police exist for a single reason, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=0.0s)]
*  to protect the Capitol, which is the home of our legislature, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=2.64s)]
*  which is the heart of our democracy, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=5.84s)]
*  our elected members of Congress. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=7.28s)]
*  But since January 6th, the Capitol Hill Police Force [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=9.76s)]
*  has been subverted by Nancy Pelosi, who oversees it, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=13.16s)]
*  and Joe Biden, the new president, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=16.36s)]
*  to become a kind of secret police force [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=17.84s)]
*  that acts on behalf of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=20.0s)]
*  Think we're overstating that? We're not. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=22.0s)]
*  Members of the Capitol Hill Police [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=24.6s)]
*  have been surveilling elected members of Congress, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  their staff and visitors to their offices. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=29.54s)]
*  Republican Congressman Troy Nails of Texas [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=33.5s)]
*  said that Capitol Hill Police officers [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=35.7s)]
*  entered his congressional office last year [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=37.54s)]
*  without his knowledge, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=39.66s)]
*  and then photographed confidential materials [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=41.1s)]
*  within the office. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=43.26s)]
*  Now, if you haven't worked on Capitol Hill or around it, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=44.18s)]
*  it's hard to overstate how completely out of bounds that is. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=46.66s)]
*  In any other administration, under any other speaker, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=49.82s)]
*  that would be considered a complete outrage. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  Now, it's just par for the course. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=56.18s)]
*  Plainclothes Capitol Police officers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=59.66s)]
*  from the department's quote, intelligence division [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=61.42s)]
*  subsequently questioned one of the congressman's aides [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=64.1s)]
*  about what was on a whiteboard within his office. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=66.9s)]
*  On Twitter, the congressman wrote quote, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=70.22s)]
*  so why is the Capitol Police leadership [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=71.62s)]
*  maliciously investigating me [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=73.86s)]
*  in an attempt to destroy me and my character? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=75.78s)]
*  Congressman Troy Nails joins us now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=79.06s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=80.62s)]
*  It's hard to overstate how shocking this story is. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=82.66s)]
*  These are the people who are paid to protect you, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=85.7s)]
*  and they're spying on you, an elected member of Congress, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=89.78s)]
*  speaking of an attack on our democracy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  Tell us why you think this happened. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  Why were they in your office? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=98.82s)]
*  Well, I think, well, first of all, thank you for having me, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=101.3s)]
*  and I think it's very clear. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=103.5s)]
*  You know, Leader McCarthy selected me to be one of the five [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  to be on the select committee, looking into January 6th, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  and I've been a very vocal critic of January 6th, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  specifically the Capitol Police, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=116.06s)]
*  the leadership of the Capitol Police, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  the intelligence section, and been very vocal about it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=119.7s)]
*  I mean, all the intelligence was there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=122.7s)]
*  It was glaring to them, and it was in their face [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=124.9s)]
*  that we knew the Capitol was the target for January 6th. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  We knew that there were maps [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  that were scattered throughout the whole city [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  about the tunnels on January 6th. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=138.22s)]
*  So all the intelligence was there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=140.54s)]
*  They knew the extremist groups were gonna be there, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=142.98s)]
*  and they did nothing with it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  So I've exposed this, and I've been very vocal about it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=146.02s)]
*  I've been vocal, too, even on your program a few months back [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=148.9s)]
*  about the death of Ashley Babbitt [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  and questioning why Lieutenant Byrd's investigation [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=154.46s)]
*  did not go to a grand jury. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=157.66s)]
*  So this really doesn't surprise me, quite honestly. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=159.26s)]
*  I'm being targeted right now, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  and I believe that Nancy Pelosi is weaponizing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=164.1s)]
*  the U.S. Capitol Police to investigate me, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=168.78s)]
*  to try to silence me, intimidate me, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=172.46s)]
*  and quite honestly, to destroy me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=174.82s)]
*  This is totally third world and crazy, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=177.38s)]
*  and it's hard to believe it's happening in the Capitol City. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=180.38s)]
*  By the way, I should note, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=183.1s)]
*  their claim is they were trying to protect you, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=184.34s)]
*  but of course they never told you about it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=186.26s)]
*  If there was a threat, they should of course alert you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=187.78s)]
*  You're the member of Congress. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=189.54s)]
*  Why don't you shut these people down? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=190.78s)]
*  How can you have Nancy Pelosi's secret police force [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=192.86s)]
*  in your office and no one shuts them down? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=196.1s)]
*  Well, the claim is that they discovered [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=200.22s)]
*  one of my office doors wide open on a Saturday afternoon. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=201.82s)]
*  The officer entered my office and said, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=205.54s)]
*  to check to see if anybody was there [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=208.5s)]
*  that shouldn't be there, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=210.22s)]
*  and saw suspicious writings on my whiteboard, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=211.1s)]
*  whereas where I draft my legislative proposals, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=213.74s)]
*  couple days later I've got these secret agents, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=216.74s)]
*  secret agents from the Capitol Police [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=219.38s)]
*  knocking on my office door, questioning my staff, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=221.86s)]
*  one of my staffers, as to the language on that board. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  Why was there body armor written on your board, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=228.66s)]
*  interrogating this staffer, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=231.22s)]
*  asking him questions related to a handwritten map [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=233.66s)]
*  of the Rayburn office building, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=237.7s)]
*  which is an office building for members of Congress, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=239.5s)]
*  and the X on it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, absolutely silly, absolutely ludicrous. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  Why were the Capitol Police inside my office [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=247.14s)]
*  investigating me? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=250.06s)]
*  And I was under a criminal investigation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=251.22s)]
*  The chief of police, Manger, he's downplaying this, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=253.54s)]
*  but I'm telling you, they're coming after anyone [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  that has a dissenting point of view, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=259.18s)]
*  anybody that doesn't agree with them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=261.02s)]
*  It happened to me, sir, I believe the NSA, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=263.18s)]
*  it happened to you looking at your emails, text messages. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=265.82s)]
*  Obama used the FBI to go after Donald Trump, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=270.14s)]
*  Russia collusion, and we know how that turned out. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  So they're weaponizing these federal law enforcement [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=277.38s)]
*  agencies and intelligence agencies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=279.9s)]
*  It's making my heart beat faster. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=283.7s)]
*  We can't put up, this is the red line [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=284.7s)]
*  that you can't tolerate in a free society. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=286.9s)]
*  You cannot use federal law enforcement agencies [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=288.86s)]
*  to go after your political enemies, period. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=291.5s)]
*  So they do in Africa, we cannot allow that here, obviously. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=293.5s)]
*  I hope you get every one of these cretins fired, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=296.46s)]
*  I mean it too. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=299.18s)]
*  Well, the office of Inspector General [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=300.26s)]
*  was in my office last week. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=303.94s)]
*  He has agreed to do a study and an investigation, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=305.46s)]
*  an independent investigation, and I feel good about that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=309.06s)]
*  We're gonna get to the bottom of it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=311.9s)]
*  I hope you will, I hope you will. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=313.14s)]
*  Thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=314.9s)]
*  Thank you, God bless. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  God bless. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpROOqpsuCM&t=318.06s)]
