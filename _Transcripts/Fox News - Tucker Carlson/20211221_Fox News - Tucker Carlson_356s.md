# Clay Travis: This is a total, unmitigated disaster
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc)
*  So here's one way to dramatically improve your time in college sports, just change your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=0.0s)]
*  gender. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=6.68s)]
*  A man at the University of Pennsylvania now says he's a woman, and as a result, he's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=7.68s)]
*  completely dominating the competition. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=12.0s)]
*  He goes by Lila Thomas and recently won a race, a swimming race, by more than 38 seconds. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  If you don't think about swimming, 38 seconds is like the normal equivalent of like four [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=21.36s)]
*  because that's just like there are no 38 second differences between top competitors in a swim [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=26.44s)]
*  meet. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  But Thomas says he should be allowed to compete in any category because he doesn't have an [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  unfair advantage. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=35.36s)]
*  I think the guidelines they set forward are very good and do a very good job of promoting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=37.72s)]
*  inclusivity while keeping competition integrity going. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=48.76s)]
*  Everybody is able to compete in the category they're most comfortable with unless there's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=57.48s)]
*  a proven unfair advantage that they have. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=66.44s)]
*  Not attacking the kid, obviously, but what about everybody else? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=72.38s)]
*  Everyone else has to pretend that that's true. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=76.62s)]
*  It's like pretending that Omicron, which doesn't actually kill people, is somehow a terrifying [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=78.36s)]
*  threat to our civilization. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=82.24s)]
*  It's like a lie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=83.24s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=84.24s)]
*  And if you have to go along with it, you're degraded because you're complicit in the dishonesty. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=85.24s)]
*  One person who's brave enough to point this out was the editor-in-chief of Swimming World [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=89.92s)]
*  magazine who compared Thomas's advantage to doping. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=94.16s)]
*  And that seemed like a big change, like an adult in the room. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=97.8s)]
*  Clay Travis has always been an adult in the room. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=101.0s)]
*  He's the founder of Outkick. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  Clay, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  So the editor of a swimming magazine pointing out what's clear to every rational person [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=107.28s)]
*  seems like an advance to me. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=111.48s)]
*  Look, Tucker, you're exactly right about this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=115.08s)]
*  First, thanks for having me on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=118.36s)]
*  Second, this is absolute insanity. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=119.72s)]
*  All right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=122.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=123.44s)]
*  You have got a biological man who didn't just decide to become a female swimmer. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=124.44s)]
*  He was good enough to be on the University of Pennsylvania men's team. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=129.68s)]
*  And then he sits out for a year, decides to identify as a woman, and shows up and dominates [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=134.6s)]
*  all of women's swimming. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about this guy potentially breaking every college women's swimming record that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=142.6s)]
*  has ever existed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=148.04s)]
*  Every woman out there who has ever competed as a swimmer or really competed in women's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=149.68s)]
*  athletics at all, who gets up early in the morning, who puts in every ounce of their [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=154.04s)]
*  into their pursuit of swimming. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=160.04s)]
*  Every feminist, every Title IX advocate should be standing up and screaming from the heavens, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  this is unacceptable because men are bigger, stronger, and faster biologically than women. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=168.92s)]
*  This is totally absurd. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=175.68s)]
*  But what you get, Tucker, and you know this, is when two left-wing ideologies, identity [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=177.2s)]
*  politics collide, you've got feminist and Title IX supporters on one side who support [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  women's athletics, and then you've got the trans agenda on the other side. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=188.44s)]
*  You have to pick a side. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=192.4s)]
*  And what often happens in these stories, look at people who cover sports media, they just [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=194.04s)]
*  pretend it doesn't exist. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  ESPN, Tucker, you know this, they love to cover every single conflict of sports and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=199.44s)]
*  politics. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=205.68s)]
*  They haven't written a single story about this, Tucker. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=206.68s)]
*  It's a sham, not one! [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=210.36s)]
*  Every time somebody doesn't go to the White House to visit Trump, it's the lead story [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=212.32s)]
*  on ESPN for five years, a biological man threatens to become the greatest women's swimmer of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=216.17999999999998s)]
*  all time, and they don't even cover it? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  They pretend it doesn't exist. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=224.98s)]
*  Well maybe that's why they're, I mean, ESPN used to be so impressive, it was famous in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  the TV business for having the smartest producers, impressive people went to ESPN, and then their [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=230.33999999999997s)]
*  numbers tanked because they became liars. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=234.77999999999997s)]
*  Like, they're just liars. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=236.82s)]
*  So who would watch that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  Well not only that, Tucker, it's the very foundation and essence of sports. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  That's why we watch, to see the best man or the best woman win. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=244.26s)]
*  We have, look, and by the way, we don't even have to talk about the transgender agenda. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  You've got kids, I've got kids. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  We don't let 10-year-olds compete against 18-year-olds in Little League Baseball, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=254.7s)]
*  We don't let flyweight boxers who weigh 120 pounds go fight heavyweight boxers like Mike [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=259.26s)]
*  Tyson back in the day because we know that's not a fair fight. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  We have all sorts of regulations. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=269.9s)]
*  Big high schools don't play little high schools, and yet we've got somehow a man deciding to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=271.86s)]
*  become a woman and he's going to be the greatest women's swimmer of all time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=277.42s)]
*  I mean, I got a good email about this recently, you'll appreciate it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=281.06s)]
*  What if LeBron James at the end of his NBA career decided he didn't want to quit playing [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  basketball and wanted to become a WNBA star and be the best men's and women's basketball [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=289.22s)]
*  player of all time because he's not going to catch Jordan? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  Are we going to allow that? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=298.16s)]
*  He could be the best women's basketball player until he's 65 probably. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=299.42s)]
*  It's a farce, it's ludicrous, it's insane, but this is where far left-wing politics mixed [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=303.22s)]
*  with sports lead us, Tucker. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=309.14000000000004s)]
*  It's an absolute unmitigated disaster. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  I kind of hope LeBron James does go to the WNBA because really no two have ever deserved [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=314.5s)]
*  one another more. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=320.54s)]
*  You know what, I'm absolutely rooting for that, actually, come to think of it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=321.54s)]
*  What if, Tucker, that was his play to catch Jordan in championships? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=325.06s)]
*  He's not going to catch him otherwise, but what if he starts to argue, hey, I got four [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=328.56s)]
*  men's championships and then I added on three women's championships in the WNBA. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  I did catch Jordan in championships. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=338.24s)]
*  I dare you to call him on it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  It's absurd, but I would love to see, maybe ESPN would even cover that story. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  We're encouraging it strongly. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=346.08s)]
*  I'd love to see the politicized ladies of the WNBA. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=347.76s)]
*  Explain why that can't happen. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  Clay Travis, great to see you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1L3F3ebYc&t=355.03999999999996s)]
