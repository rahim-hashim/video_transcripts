# Author tells Tucker Jan. 6 defendants are languishing in a ‘DC gulag’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8)
*  We haven't answered every question about what actually happened on January 6. Far from it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=0.0s)]
*  There are so many mysteries from that day. But one thing we know for certain is that the story [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=5.2s)]
*  they told you about it, a pat tail of good versus evil, an insurrection with no guns [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=9.52s)]
*  that took place at the U.S. Capitol, those were lies. And they were lies told for a very specific [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  purpose. Of course, the people in power wanted more power and they got it on the basis of those [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  lies. But in the process, many lives were destroyed and some people are still in jail tonight, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=26.24s)]
*  not having had their constitutionally guaranteed moment in front of a jury of their peers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=33.36s)]
*  They haven't even put on trial yet and they're still rotting. Julie Kelly is the one journalist [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=38.64s)]
*  in this country who's been following us very closely. She wrote a book on it. January 6, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  the Democrats used the Capitol protest to launch a war on terror against the political right, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  which is a perfect summation of what actually happened. Julie Kelly joins us now. Julie, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=53.52s)]
*  thanks so much for coming on. So it dawned on us as these tapes made very clear that the story we've [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=57.92s)]
*  been presented is an absolute fabrication. It's a lie. It's a fraud. That people may still be in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=64.56s)]
*  jail on the basis of these lies. And so we wanted to talk to you for an update on where those cases [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  are tonight. So yes, there are, well, at least 100 men have been held under pretrial detention [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=76.88s)]
*  orders over the past two years. That means that a judge has denied them bail because the government, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=85.44s)]
*  DOJ, successfully argued that that individual was a threat to the community. This includes Tucker [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  people charged with nonviolent offenses like obstruction and conspiracy. So of course, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=97.44s)]
*  they don't have access to what could very easily be exculpatory evidence contained in this video. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=104.32s)]
*  But aside from the now, I think around three dozen men who are held under pretrial detention [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=111.52s)]
*  orders, Tucker, believe it or not, there are some men going on 24, 25, 26 months denied bail, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=116.56s)]
*  languishing in jail, including the D.C. Gulag, as the government continues to delay their trials. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=124.16s)]
*  This all has the imprimatur, by the way, of every judge on the D.C. District Court. I want to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=130.88s)]
*  emphasize the real villains here are the federal judges in Washington, D.C., who have allowed the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=137.12s)]
*  government to play every single game to keep this evidence out of the hands of defendants, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=143.04s)]
*  violating their oath of office to protect the rights of defendants and their due process rights. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=148.48s)]
*  So I really want to emphasize that. But look, Tucker, there's a thousand criminal defendants [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=153.92s)]
*  right now. Half of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. So and the government [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=158.88s)]
*  just announced two months ago in January that they were still uploading global, they call it discovery, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=165.28s)]
*  which means material related to the entire investigation. What they did was arrest people [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=171.92s)]
*  first, find the evidence later and cover up what could potentially exonerate these defendants. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=177.84s)]
*  If this were happening in any other country, the U.S. State Department would immediately [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=185.2s)]
*  acknowledge that these were violations of the most basic human rights. These are political prisoners [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=188.48s)]
*  and the U.S. government would condemn it. But it's happening here and it's ignored, except by you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=192.56s)]
*  And I so appreciate your tireless reporting on this. Julie Kelly, thank you. Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x507RDDvb8&t=196.95999999999998s)]
