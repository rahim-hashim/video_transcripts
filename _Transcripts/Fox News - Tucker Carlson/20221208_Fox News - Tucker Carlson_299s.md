# 'Do Not Amplify': Charlie Kirk revealed to be on Twitter blacklist
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo)
*  Charlie Kirk is someone else who apparently was censored by Twitter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the founder and president of Turning Point USA. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  We just told you that Barry Weiss a few moments ago reported that internally Twitter censors [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  set Charlie Kirk's account to do not amplify status. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=10.16s)]
*  Charlie Kirk joins us right now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=13.52s)]
*  Charlie, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=16.04s)]
*  You're just hearing this too. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=19.28s)]
*  I mean, this just happened. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=20.28s)]
*  This is happening, in fact, as we talk about it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=21.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Do you have any idea which of your tweets set this censorship in motion? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=25.08s)]
*  I could probably guess. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=33.48s)]
*  You know, a couple of years ago, Axios did a study that showed that our Twitter account [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=34.48s)]
*  was the fourth most engaged Twitter account on the planet, right up there with President [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=39.44s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=42.8s)]
*  I mean, I've been using Twitter for a decade, happened to understand it really well, and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=43.8s)]
*  we were averaging 115,000 retweets a day when we were really at our peak. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=47.0s)]
*  We would talk about, for example, in the midst of the virus, how lockdowns might not be the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  best decision. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=56.32s)]
*  We started talking about how, hey, are there other treatments that we might want to talk [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=57.44s)]
*  about? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=61.04s)]
*  So it could have been that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=62.04s)]
*  But then all of a sudden we saw off a cliff, almost immediately, our engagement, our retweets [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=63.04s)]
*  disappear. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=67.68s)]
*  I started to talk about this a lot, Tucker, and I was called the conspiracy theorist. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=68.84s)]
*  I was smeared. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=72.84s)]
*  And I started to email the people that I... [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=74.32s)]
*  You're crazy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=77.0s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=78.0s)]
*  Wait, you're cueing on. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=79.0s)]
*  I'm like, wait, hold on a second. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=80.0s)]
*  So we were at 115,000 retweets. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=81.16s)]
*  And then it's kind of one of those things, right, Tucker, where they convince you to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=82.6s)]
*  stop talking about it because you sound like, okay, who cares about your Twitter account? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=85.5s)]
*  Not a big deal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=88.84s)]
*  And now you see actual verified documents where my Twitter account was labeled as do-not-amplify, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=90.18s)]
*  NSFW, which I could only infer means not safe for work. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=96.28s)]
*  Other threat tags. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=101.16s)]
*  They're treating my Twitter account with more scrutiny and censorship than the prime minister [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=102.84s)]
*  of Iran, than Hamas, than people that do actual terroristic-type damage. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=108.42s)]
*  And now we have evidence to show that's exactly what my Twitter account the last couple of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=114.94s)]
*  years has been down 95% in engagement. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=118.22s)]
*  They saw what I had to say as a direct threat to the regime. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=121.42s)]
*  So there's a huge amount of unfiltered hardcore pornography on Twitter, I think, to this day. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=126.42s)]
*  But it was your Twitter account that was not safe for work. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=131.5s)]
*  Apparently, asking questions about our lockdown policy, which obviously hurt children and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=136.42s)]
*  hurt our target audience at Turning Point USA College Kids, where they had to go home [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=141.89999999999998s)]
*  and start a screen all day long and turned into most suicidal, depressed, alcohol- and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=145.82s)]
*  drug-addicted generation in history. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=149.42s)]
*  I started tweeting about that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=150.82s)]
*  Apparently, that was a threat. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=152.42s)]
*  Now, my question, though, Tucker, is were they told to do this by Anthony Fauci? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Were they told to do this by the federal government? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=158.82s)]
*  Was my tweet somehow able to create viral counter-messaging to what they wanted to see [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=161.32s)]
*  happen in 2020? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=168.12s)]
*  We may never know, but Twitter at its best, when it was really something that was worthy [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  of appreciation, I hope it gets there soon, was a place where heterodox ideas were able [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=175.12s)]
*  to spread instantaneously with virality and hold powerful people accountable. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=179.12s)]
*  I happened to have one of those accounts for a couple years, and Twitter went out of their [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=183.72s)]
*  way to censor it and suffocate our account. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=187.4s)]
*  Let me ask, did you ever complain, because you understand the platform, so you knew that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=189.92s)]
*  something inorganic was happening, something fake was happening, someone was putting a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=195.2s)]
*  thumb on the scale, did you complain to Twitter about it? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=199.42s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=202.92s)]
*  So, I had a very warm meeting with some of the Twitter employees back in the summer of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=203.92s)]
*  18. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=206.92s)]
*  I actually met with Jack Dorsey personally, where he assured me that shadow batting wasn't [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=207.92s)]
*  happening, and I didn't really believe him at the time, but I said, okay, whatever, because [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=210.92s)]
*  I wasn't really experiencing a lot of what we consider censorship. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=213.72s)]
*  And then six months later, 12 months later, I still had their contact information, and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=216.82s)]
*  I started to write them like, hey guys, something's not right here, silence. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  And then the virus happened in 2020, and you could not get a response out of Twitter. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=223.72s)]
*  And then you would start to tweet at Jack and tweet at the Twitter management, and it [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  was almost as if it became a wholly operated company that kind of changed their modus operandi [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=233.34s)]
*  from being somewhat of a social media platform to a Democrat super PAC. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  And I don't think they really cared. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=244.42s)]
*  And Elon, praise God for his courage and his bravery revealing this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=246.5s)]
*  And I try to get lawmakers involved and other people, and I don't think we'll ever be able [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=250.82s)]
*  to measure the impact of what Twitter did to our voices online in the calendar year [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=255.36s)]
*  of 2020. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=260.3s)]
*  The lives that were lost, the kids that really had speech impediments and delays in school [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=261.3s)]
*  closures, and of course, the outcome of the 2020 election all came from a censorship regime [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=265.46s)]
*  from Twitter. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=271.06s)]
*  That's totally right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=272.3s)]
*  Twitter did this, we learned, last week, partly because everyone who works there is a liberal, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=273.3s)]
*  but partly because Democrats in Congress threaten them if they didn't do this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=277.1s)]
*  Republicans in Congress just sat back and talked about the free market, useless as always. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=280.26s)]
*  Charlie Kirk, great to see you tonight. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=285.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAJ3Dvj7yUo&t=287.90000000000003s)]
