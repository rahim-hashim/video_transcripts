# This was going to be a state propaganda machine: Josh Hawley
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg)
*  Josh Hawley is of course a senator from Missouri. He joins us tonight with these documents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for coming in and for doing this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=3.36s)]
*  So this was aimed, tell me if I'm mischaracterizing this, at our population. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=5.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. As it turns out, Tucker, the people that the Biden administration [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=12.24s)]
*  thinks are the real threat to America, it's not the drug cartels, it's not foreign threats, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  it's you, it's the American people. If you have questions about COVID, if you have questions about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=20.96s)]
*  COVID masks, if you have questions about the COVID vaccine, this administration wanted you to be [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=25.12s)]
*  monitored. This disinformation board was set up to go after you. That's what the documents say. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=31.04s)]
*  By the way, election integrity, same story. The documents specifically mention that they needed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  to be a disinformation board because some people were having questions about election integrity. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=40.64s)]
*  Some people had questions about January 6th. Well, we couldn't have that. And this board was set up [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=45.68s)]
*  to monitor that. That was what was in their sights. And I tell you, Tucker, it just gives [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=50.64s)]
*  the lie to what they were saying in public. So the federal government partnering with [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=55.36s)]
*  private companies to censor Americans who criticize Pfizer is unconstitutional, isn't it? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=61.28s)]
*  Yeah, you would sure think so. I mean, this idea that the government is going to stand up an [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=68.72s)]
*  institution that's going to monitor American speech, that's going to treat Americans' political [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=73.36s)]
*  speech, Tucker, core political speech about political issues as something that needs to be [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=78.4s)]
*  monitored, that needs to be countered. This was going to be a state propaganda machine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=83.68s)]
*  This board was supposed to push out counter information to Americans who are raising [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  questions and, yes, to partner with Big Tech. The whole idea here, and the documents show this, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=92.48s)]
*  is that the government would get together with Big Tech and collect information on Americans who [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=97.04s)]
*  were raising these questions. I mean, how dare you? That's the whole idea here, is that the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  government and Big Tech, these companies, would partner together in this massive censorship [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=107.6s)]
*  campaign. It is truly, truly chilling. It's beyond belief. And thank you for proving [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  what everyone suspected, beyond a shadow of a doubt. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, thank you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_MwAA3zbg&t=117.44s)]
