# Failure of San Francisco's homeless initiative exposed
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws)
*  It's not just San Francisco where this is happening, by the way. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=0.0s)]
*  Jason Rantz, our West Coast correspondent, has been looking into this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=3.0s)]
*  He's a radio show host in Seattle, of course. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=6.08s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=7.5s)]
*  Hey, Jason. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=8.5s)]
*  Hey, I would argue that disaster is probably an understatement. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=9.5s)]
*  So the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, they poured $160 million into a program [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=13.38s)]
*  to create these homeless hotels. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=19.6s)]
*  They turn hotel rooms into permanent supportive housing that ends up getting managed by various [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=21.64s)]
*  nonprofits. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=26.48s)]
*  It's been a total failure, at least 166 fatal drug overdoses between 2020 and 2021 at these [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=27.96s)]
*  hotels. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=35.6s)]
*  The homeless have been violent there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=36.6s)]
*  We're talking about assaults, stabbing, fires, threats to kill staff. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=38.9s)]
*  On top of that, some of the hotels are in total shambles. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=43.2s)]
*  Bathrooms and elevators don't work, serious rat infestations, roaches are everywhere. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=47.2s)]
*  One homeless woman said she pitched a tent inside of her room to keep the rats or the bugs out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=53.32s)]
*  The goal for these hotels is to get homeless people into independent housing, but the city [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=58.32s)]
*  tracked over 500 people who actually left the program. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=63.0s)]
*  They found a quarter of them died, 21 percent returned to homelessness, 27 percent left [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=66.28s)]
*  the area and couldn't be tracked at all. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  Only about a quarter of them got into housing again, and those were mostly people living [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=73.48s)]
*  with family or going into other subsidized housing programs. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  Now, thanks to Mayor London Breed, who lobbied against an oversight commission, the problems [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=81.28s)]
*  have only gotten worse. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=86.6s)]
*  Since the city created the Department of Homelessness, homelessness increased by 56 percent, this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  according to The Chronicle. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=94.72s)]
*  Now, despite that, earlier this month we got an announcement from Mayor Breed that she's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=95.72s)]
*  purchasing another hotel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=99.84s)]
*  And as you point out, different versions basically of the strategy are happening all across the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=102.24s)]
*  country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=106.16s)]
*  So last month in Los Angeles, homeless people at an encampment were moved to a four-star [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=107.16s)]
*  hotel as part of a county and city program. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=110.96s)]
*  Here in Seattle, they're spending tens of millions of dollars in King County to buy [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=114.24s)]
*  hotels for low barrier permanent housing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=118.0s)]
*  The most recent one is just feet away from a school. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=121.36s)]
*  And then New York, they pushed $100 million into this hotel conversion program. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=124.28s)]
*  It's been stalled because of zoning laws, so the Democrats are basically saying, OK, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=128.22s)]
*  let's push a bill to make it easier to create these homeless hotels. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=131.2s)]
*  They are failing everywhere they go, and it's not just local dollars, to your point. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=134.92s)]
*  The Biden administration is putting a lot of dollars into it through COVID funds. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=139.96s)]
*  It's all so cruel. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=144.6s)]
*  I mean, it just results in people dying. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=145.6s)]
*  Jason Rantz, as always, such a detailed and precise accounting. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqg_j-WEkws&t=151.76000000000002s)]
