# Urban planner explains how we can make cities more human-centered
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0)
*  People don't think or talk too much about architecture, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=0.0s)]
*  about the way their homes are designed, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=4.24s)]
*  or even their towns are designed, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=5.76s)]
*  but there is a reason that things are built the way they are. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=7.96s)]
*  They're either pro-human or they're anti-human. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=12.14s)]
*  And unfortunately, so much of our architecture [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=15.56s)]
*  and our city planning is anti-human. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=17.2s)]
*  Andres Duwani is one of the very few urban planners [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=19.12s)]
*  who's thought deeply about architecture [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=22.36s)]
*  and planning that brings people together, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=24.48s)]
*  that makes them happy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  He founded the Congress for the New Urbanism. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=29.6s)]
*  He's got a plan to build cities [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=31.88s)]
*  where people might actually know each other once again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=34.44s)]
*  We had an amazing conversation with him [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=37.16s)]
*  on a brand new episode of Tucker Carlson today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=38.76s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=40.56s)]
*  The town plan, it really affects your life. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=41.84s)]
*  For example, a kid that has to be driven everywhere [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=50.32s)]
*  is a kid with no freedom at all. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=54.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=56.92s)]
*  An older person that no longer can drive [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  is a prisoner, highly isolated. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=60.76s)]
*  So what we design are places that are walkable, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=63.28s)]
*  above all walkable, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=66.92s)]
*  where you can get to your daily needs by walking. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  You could have a car, but you don't have to use it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  And I think what makes America pretty awful [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=74.8s)]
*  is that the car is mandatory. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=76.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=78.72s)]
*  If you did not have a car, almost at an individual level, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  every individual has a car, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=82.08s)]
*  you would literally starve to death in a couple of days. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=83.64s)]
*  And so... [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=86.64s)]
*  We're so used to that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  that we don't imagine there's an alternative. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=89.2s)]
*  And yet up to about 1950, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=91.24s)]
*  before the cars were widespread, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=92.88s)]
*  and before everyone essentially had one, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=94.84s)]
*  every place, right across cultures, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=99.16s)]
*  you needed your daily needs within walking distance. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  It was absolutely normal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=105.12s)]
*  The Romans did it, the Chinese did it, everybody did it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=107.06s)]
*  And then the car eradicated that discipline. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aadJC3cgO0&t=110.88s)]
