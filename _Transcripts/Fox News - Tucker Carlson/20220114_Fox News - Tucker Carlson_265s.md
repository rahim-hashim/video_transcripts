# Tucker takes on Satanic Temple
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI)
*  Well, in case you're wondering if it's really a spiritual war we're watching, here's this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=0.0s)]
*  news story. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=4.34s)]
*  The Illinois Elementary School is offering an after school Satan Club. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=5.34s)]
*  The local school district is defending the Satan Club. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=9.0s)]
*  It's sponsored by the Satanic Temple of the United States. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=11.8s)]
*  The club claims it will help kids learn benevolence and empathy as well as, quote, personal sovereignty. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=14.32s)]
*  We're going to the source in this story. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=18.68s)]
*  Lucien Graves is with the Satanic Temple and joins us tonight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=20.64s)]
*  Mr. Graves, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=24.0s)]
*  So I have to ask, are parents complaining that there's an after school Satan Club at [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=27.4s)]
*  their children's school? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=33.36s)]
*  Some are, but they don't have to send their children to the program. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=36.04s)]
*  It's available for parents who do want to send their children to the program and it's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=38.92s)]
*  there as an alternative to religious clubs that are made to proselytize to children. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=42.68s)]
*  Ours doesn't include items of religious opinion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=48.36s)]
*  It doesn't include indoctrination. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  It just has a self-directed learning program with trained educators there to help guide [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=52.64s)]
*  the children through different activities and projects that they want to engage in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=58.0s)]
*  Where are the Satan Clubs trained educators trained? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=61.88s)]
*  Is there a Satan School of Theology? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=66.2s)]
*  No we've got educators who have volunteered with us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=70.6s)]
*  We vet them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=74.6s)]
*  We do the criminal background checks that aren't required of after school clubs and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=75.6s)]
*  required of any of the religious clubs because we want to be responsible about this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=79.64s)]
*  We make sure that they understand the curriculum, they understand what we want to do in this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=86.44s)]
*  program and that they're able to execute that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  I love your use of the word execute. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=94.92s)]
*  So have any school administrators said, look I know you can lecture me about religious [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=97.56s)]
*  freedom but you're a Satan Club and we're not going to let little kids go to the Satan [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=101.72s)]
*  Club. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=105.12s)]
*  Are they just passive like everyone else in America and kind of letting it happen? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  Well that's not being passive. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=110.48s)]
*  That's understanding what the law is. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=111.92s)]
*  That's understanding what the Constitution is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=113.56s)]
*  That's understanding what free speech is and what religious liberty is. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=115.44s)]
*  And there's a lot of people who express a lot of uproar about this and they go to the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  school board. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=123.44s)]
*  They complain to the principals. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=124.44s)]
*  They complain to the superintendent. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=125.58000000000001s)]
*  But a school board cannot overturn the Supreme Court. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=127.56s)]
*  Well actually so could there be an I Hate Gays Club? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=130.76s)]
*  Or Black People Are Inferior Club? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  And the answer of course is no because the community, and I'm not advocating for either [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=138.56s)]
*  one of those things, but the community has some say in what its kids are exposed to on [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=141.64s)]
*  government property, i.e. a public school. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=147.1s)]
*  So you're just telling me that everyone's just kind of going along with it because of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=151.12s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=154.2s)]
*  Well the Supreme Court allowed in religion. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  They said that not having religious clubs would be religious discrimination. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=163.2s)]
*  I think you can categorically deny religion. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=164.2s)]
*  But what you can't do is give the government the opportunity to pick and choose between [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=166.64s)]
*  which religious viewpoints they'll allow and which ones they won't. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=170.64s)]
*  They do all the time. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean you can be suspended from school for quoting portions of the Old Testament. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  Like immediately you could be. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=178.56s)]
*  I mean I'm trying not to use profanity on the air but what you're saying is ridiculous. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  We both know it's ridiculous. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=183.88s)]
*  And I just want to be really clear on this because to me it's another example of people [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  just sitting back and being like oh I guess I have to. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=188.72s)]
*  You know it's another drag time story hour for fourth graders. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  But that you know I can't say anything. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=193.48s)]
*  And you're confirming that everyone feels that way. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=195.6s)]
*  They kind of have to go along with it for some reason. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=197.44s)]
*  Well people get upset about it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=200.72s)]
*  People like you and they don't reconcile their viewpoints on free speech and religious liberty. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what you're suggesting. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=207.32s)]
*  I don't know if you're suggesting if the school board should say no this is not allowed [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=208.76s)]
*  and we're going against the Supreme Court ruling. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  What I'm saying is you ought to be allowed to quote the New Testament out loud in school [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=214.76s)]
*  I mean if we're going to apply the standard which I suppose I'd be happy to live under [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=220.42s)]
*  we have to apply it equally but it's not applied equally as you know. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=224.1s)]
*  And I suppose I mean have you been in touch. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=227.74s)]
*  I don't know the New Testament story you're speaking of but we would defend anybody's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  right to practice their religion and we're not asking for other religious clubs to be [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=233.94s)]
*  taken out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  Look I'm not even equal access. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=241.62s)]
*  And I'm just saying the school would not provide that if it were an expression of Orthodox [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=242.62s)]
*  Christianity as you know. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=246.66s)]
*  Lucian Graves I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVVp9bcjWI&t=249.46s)]
