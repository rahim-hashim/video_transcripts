# Tucker Carlson: The US is about to run out of diesel fuel
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, there are a lot of far away places in this world, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=2.24s)]
*  Namibia, for example, but Europe is not one of them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=4.84s)]
*  Europe is where your kids spent junior year abroad. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Europe is an easy flight from the East coast [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=10.16s)]
*  of the United States to pretty much anywhere on the continent. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  And you know this if you've been on vacation in Europe [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=14.84s)]
*  as millions of Americans have. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=16.8s)]
*  For the most part, they speak English in Europe. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=18.84s)]
*  They've got Starbucks and Taco Bell [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=20.88s)]
*  and air conditioning and modern hospitals. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=22.48s)]
*  It is not another world. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=24.72s)]
*  So given that, given how closely related [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=26.76s)]
*  the United States is to Europe and has always been, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=28.8s)]
*  you would imagine our leaders would notice [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=31.6s)]
*  when Europe began to fall apart, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  especially when the signs were not subtle at all [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=36.44s)]
*  and they weren't. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=38.84s)]
*  This summer, Germans began clear cutting ancient forests [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=40.24s)]
*  to heat their homes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  In Poland, families queued up for hours to buy coal, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  just like they did 150 years ago. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=48.92s)]
*  In the UK, the government projected [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=51.68s)]
*  that more than 10,000 Britons will freeze to death, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=54.5s)]
*  will die this winter for lack of heating fuel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=57.24s)]
*  Freeze to death. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=60.92s)]
*  In England, that is not supposed to happen [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=62.58s)]
*  in a first world country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=65.36s)]
*  So Europe is moving backward at high speed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=66.58s)]
*  and it's not clear where it'll end. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=70.0s)]
*  So the question is, why is this happening? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=72.66s)]
*  And the answer for once is a very simple one, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=74.16s)]
*  the war in Ukraine, that's why it's happening. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=76.0s)]
*  A huge percentage of Europe's energy came from Russia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=78.14s)]
*  Those imports have now been banned, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=81.16s)]
*  supposedly to punish Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=82.48s)]
*  What's the result of this punishment? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=85.16s)]
*  Well, the Russian ruble is now far stronger [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=87.36s)]
*  than it was a year ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  The European economy, meanwhile, is collapsing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=91.64s)]
*  Europeans are much poorer than they were [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=94.94s)]
*  when the war in Ukraine started. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=97.94s)]
*  So how is that a victory for Europe [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=100.12s)]
*  and the West and democracy? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=103.28s)]
*  Well, that's a fair question, it's an obvious question, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  but no one in Washington appears to be asking that question. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  Instead, the Biden administration is doubling down [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=111.14s)]
*  on the self-destructive mistakes [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=113.68s)]
*  that are destroying the European Union. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=116.12s)]
*  The White House banned Russian oil, natural gas, and coal. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=118.36000000000001s)]
*  It was our moral duty. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=121.28s)]
*  And then at the same time, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration crushed domestic oil production here [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  by canceling oil and gas leases. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=126.92s)]
*  And then, as if that wasn't enough, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration sold a piece [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=130.96s)]
*  of our strategic petroleum reserve, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  maybe this country's most important resource, to China. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=134.8s)]
*  None of this hurt Putin in any way, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=139.68s)]
*  all of it impoverishes the United States. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=141.4s)]
*  So what could possibly be the justification for doing that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=144.6s)]
*  We've wondered. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=148.56s)]
*  Anyone who's paying attention has had to have wondered that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=149.96s)]
*  Well, this week, Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=152.76s)]
*  of Bethesda, answered that question. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=155.72s)]
*  Russia is an Orthodox Christian country [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=158.6s)]
*  with traditional social values. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=161.28s)]
*  And for that reason, it must be destroyed [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=163.44s)]
*  no matter what the cost to us. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=166.32s)]
*  So this is not a conventional war. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=169.5s)]
*  This is a jihad. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=171.86s)]
*  Jamie Raskin said that out loud, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=174.14s)]
*  but many in Washington agree with him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=176.42s)]
*  In both parties, they would like to see [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=178.3s)]
*  World War Trans immediately. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=180.02s)]
*  So what is a jihad going to mean for you? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=184.26s)]
*  Well, the details are stunning. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=187.66s)]
*  Thanks to the Biden administration's religious war [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=191.18s)]
*  in Ukraine, this country is about to run out of diesel fuel. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=193.62s)]
*  According to data from the Energy Information Administration, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=197.17999999999998s)]
*  by the Monday of Thanksgiving week, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=199.89999999999998s)]
*  that's 25 days from now, there will be no more diesel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  So what's gonna happen then? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  Well, everything will stop. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  That means trucks and trains and barges all unable to move. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=208.66s)]
*  Farm equipment will shut down. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=213.14s)]
*  There'll be no deliveries because there'll be no trucks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  There'll be no diesel generators. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  And then inevitably, our economy will crash [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  because everything runs on diesel fuel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=222.42s)]
*  Not on solar panels, not on wind farms, on diesel fuel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=226.6s)]
*  Diesel is not a negotiable commodity. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  You have to have diesel. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=231.48s)]
*  So what happens when we don't have it? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=233.68s)]
*  Well, yesterday, Fox's Jackie Heinrich, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  apparently alone in the White House press corps, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=239.16s)]
*  asked the White House spokesman, John Kirby, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=241.32s)]
*  that very question. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=243.4s)]
*  What's the plan here? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=244.4s)]
*  We're running out of diesel. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  John Kirby standing at the podium, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  representing the White House, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  the President of the United States, the administration, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=250.16s)]
*  the largest organization in human history, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=252.32s)]
*  the executive branch of government, had no answer. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=255.12s)]
*  But don't worry, he said, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=258.56s)]
*  we will be exporting plenty of energy to Europe [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=259.96s)]
*  to help fight that progressive crusade in Ukraine. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=262.56s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=265.84s)]
*  What are we doing to increase the supply of diesel, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=267.64s)]
*  given that the Energy Information Administration said, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=270.68s)]
*  as of October 14th, the US only had about a 25-day supply. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=273.2s)]
*  You have the Northeast and New York already rationing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=277.68s)]
*  home heating oil. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=280.96s)]
*  What are we doing to prepare for the winter [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=282.88s)]
*  and to ramp up supply of diesel? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=285.4s)]
*  I'll take the question on the diesel, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=287.44s)]
*  because I just don't have the data on that in front of me. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=288.8s)]
*  So let me take that, and we'll get back to you on that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=290.88s)]
*  But writ large, the President has been working very, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=294.2s)]
*  very hard to make sure that we're — [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=296.96s)]
*  that not only are we ready for fluctuations that could come, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=299.6s)]
*  and of course, the prices are going down, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=303.12s)]
*  and we think that's important, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=304.92s)]
*  but that we are also doing what we can [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=307.6s)]
*  to help our European friends and partners, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=310.0s)]
*  who are also going to be facing a long, cold winter. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=312.48s)]
*  We have doubled our commitment, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=314.52s)]
*  the commitment he made in March for natural gas exports to Europe. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=316.56s)]
*  We've doubled that commitment in terms of actual — [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  getting things over there, getting natural gas over there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=324.28s)]
*  And we are working with foreign suppliers of natural gas and oil [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=326.56s)]
*  to see if we can't help our European partners [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  diversify their own storage and supplies. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=332.36s)]
*  So just pause and savor the irony here, just for a moment, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=335.76s)]
*  because now everything is irony. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=339.12s)]
*  They've been telling you for decades, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=341.16s)]
*  since Al Gore left the White House, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=344.04s)]
*  that the single greatest threat to the world was warming, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=346.04s)]
*  and because of their efforts to fight warming, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  you are in danger of freezing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  And unlike warming, freezing actually kills people, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=356.16s)]
*  a lot of people every year, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  and it will kill people in the West this year [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=360.76000000000005s)]
*  thanks to their efforts to fight warming. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=363.36s)]
*  The second thing to notice [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=366.92s)]
*  is the White House spokesman's totally uninterested blase response [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=368.6s)]
*  to the most basic question anyone could ask, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  which is, what are we doing about the fact we're running out of diesel fuel? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  And he has no idea, and he's not embarrassed that he has no idea. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  The problem is, at this point, there may not be an answer, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  because there may not be a way to avoid a disaster. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  Diesel fuel is not just low in this country, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=389.88s)]
*  it's low in every Western nation that has aligned itself with Ukraine. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=391.72s)]
*  All these nations preparing for World War Trans [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=396.56s)]
*  are running out of diesel fuel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=399.12s)]
*  As New York Magazine has reported, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=401.2s)]
*  the last time there was this little supply of diesel, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=402.64s)]
*  there were about 3.5 billion fewer people on the planet. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=405.0s)]
*  Well, that puts it in perspective. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=408.88s)]
*  So the Biden administration responded, as you know, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=411.2s)]
*  earlier this year to rising gas prices, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=413.36s)]
*  which they feared above all, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=415.16s)]
*  because the midterms are coming in two weeks, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=416.28s)]
*  by tapping the strategic petroleum reserves. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=418.48s)]
*  But that will not work here. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=420.44s)]
*  The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=422.48s)]
*  contains a million barrels of diesel, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=424.36s)]
*  in case of emergencies. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=426.4s)]
*  The problem is, the demand is so high across the board [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=427.88s)]
*  that according to the Washington Post, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  even if the Biden administration used every single barrel [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  in that stockpile, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  that stockpile would be empty in less than six hours. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  And of course, it's not just diesel that's running out. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=443.0s)]
*  Jet fuel is up about 23% in just the last month. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=445.0s)]
*  Kerosene, which if you don't live in New York City, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=448.88s)]
*  you know perfectly well it's used to heat people's homes [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  and keep them from dying, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=452.84s)]
*  is now close to $7 a gallon. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=454.84s)]
*  Who heats with kerosene, by the way? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=456.84s)]
*  Poor people heat with kerosene. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=459.23999999999995s)]
*  And they're the ones who can't get it, $7 a gallon. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=461.84s)]
*  In New England, people are worried [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=464.96s)]
*  about freezing to death this winter. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=466.11999999999995s)]
*  Here's a local Fox report. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=467.2s)]
*  West Hartford homeowner, Sharona Resnick-Cravett, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  has been paying for oil to heat her home [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=472.23999999999995s)]
*  for more than 35 years. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=474.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, this is New England. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=477.28s)]
*  It gets cold here, we're cold. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=478.2s)]
*  Sharona is a widow living on a fixed income. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=480.2s)]
*  She says before her husband passed away, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=483.28s)]
*  they shared the bills. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=485.67999999999995s)]
*  Now she is having to make sacrifices. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  How are you preparing and trying to figure out [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  what can you sacrifice at this point? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=492.44s)]
*  Food. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=495.32s)]
*  I go to the grocery store [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=496.84s)]
*  and I'm very frugal about what I buy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  She tells me at $6 a gallon, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=499.78s)]
*  buying oil has become a huge burden. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=502.79999999999995s)]
*  The average home uses 800 gallons of oil per year. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=505.55999999999995s)]
*  That's almost $5,000 at the current rate. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=509.56s)]
*  This shouldn't be happening in this of all countries. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=514.16s)]
*  The United States has some of the deepest, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=517.48s)]
*  by some measures, the deepest energy reserves on the planet. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=519.36s)]
*  It's our main strength. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=522.8s)]
*  Cheap energy is the reason this is a rich country. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=524.4s)]
*  That's the reason. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=527.88s)]
*  That's why we're exceptional, because we have cheap energy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=529.72s)]
*  And this country was energy independent just a few years ago. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=533.84s)]
*  Now, if you want to fix the economy, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=537.24s)]
*  you would make this country energy independent once again. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=539.88s)]
*  You would bring back cheap energy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=542.96s)]
*  That will fix the economy quicker than anything else. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=544.4s)]
*  In fact, it's the only thing that'll fix the economy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=546.76s)]
*  But the Biden administration, for whatever reason, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=549.44s)]
*  has done the opposite. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=552.36s)]
*  Depleting our strategic petroleum reserve, for example. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=553.32s)]
*  They just released another 15 million barrels the other day. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=555.92s)]
*  Because they know that's running out. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=560.0s)]
*  The White House is also begging foreign governments for help [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=561.4s)]
*  in the most humiliating possible way. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=565.14s)]
*  Biden just went and begged the Saudis in secret for more oil. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=567.16s)]
*  As the New York Times reported this week, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=570.52s)]
*  Biden's top aides, quote, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=571.8399999999999s)]
*  thought they had struck a secret deal [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=572.92s)]
*  to boost oil production through the end of the year. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  But then the Saudi royal family decided not to go along with it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=577.48s)]
*  They're not ramping up their oil production. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=580.24s)]
*  They're doing the opposite. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=581.68s)]
*  Saudi's oil minister is now telling the West [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=583.52s)]
*  to brace for energy shortages. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=585.12s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=586.8s)]
*  It is my profound duty to make it clear to the world [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=588.1999999999999s)]
*  that losing emergency stock may become painful in the months to come. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=594.8s)]
*  So an energy shortage is not really a debate [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  over whether some dude should be on the girls' swim team. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=606.76s)]
*  This is adult stuff. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=609.56s)]
*  Countries rise and fall on the basis of what energy costs. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=611.8399999999999s)]
*  And when there's a real energy shortage, things fall apart. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  People die. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=620.5999999999999s)]
*  Economies collapse. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=621.9599999999999s)]
*  We're in a time of poverty sets in systemic poverty, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  not just in the bad part of town, but in your part of town. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  So this is a real thing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  The problem is the people running the government are children. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=631.92s)]
*  They not only can't admit what they've done wrong, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=636.76s)]
*  they don't even understand it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=639.0s)]
*  Here's Corrine Jean-Pierre, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=641.76s)]
*  the glass ceiling shattering spokeswoman at the White House, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=644.68s)]
*  addressing the question yesterday. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=648.0s)]
*  I'm anxious to get your thoughts on this New York Times report [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=650.3599999999999s)]
*  because I think it's a very important one. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=653.0s)]
*  The Saudi officials thought they had a deal with the Saudis [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=655.0s)]
*  before the president went to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=658.52s)]
*  for his meeting with the crown prince. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=661.24s)]
*  But they thought they had a deal on oil supplies and oil, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  price of oil, but that the Saudis backed out of that deal. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=666.8s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=671.3599999999999s)]
*  So we have been very clear about how we believe [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=672.64s)]
*  parts of that report was mischaracterized, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=675.76s)]
*  and there has been some changes that have been made to that report. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=678.0s)]
*  The trip to the Middle East was not about oil. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=681.84s)]
*  Was there an understanding, Corrine, with the Saudis [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=684.24s)]
*  that the Saudis then backed away from? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=687.32s)]
*  Again, the trip was not about oil. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=689.28s)]
*  This is embarrassing. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  She can't even conjugate the verb correctly. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=694.52s)]
*  This is the spokesperson. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=696.6800000000001s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZoli8oekg&t=699.0s)]
