# Jesse Watters: This claim changed the course of US politics
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. I'm Jesse Waters in for Tucker. The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=0.0s)]
*  left still in a complete meltdown over Glenn Youngkin's win in Virginia. They're accusing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=5.38s)]
*  anybody who voted for him of being a tiki torch carrying white supremacist. More on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=9.48s)]
*  that in a minute. But first, Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=14.08s)]
*  president in mid July of 2016. Just days later, a Russian national living in this country [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=18.72s)]
*  made a claim that would upend Donald Trump's candidacy and eventually his presidency. It's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=24.8s)]
*  a claim that changed the course of U.S. politics for the next four years. The Russian national, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=30.52s)]
*  a man named Igor Danchenko, said he had just received a phone call proving that Donald [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=35.64s)]
*  Trump's campaign was conspiring with the Russian government. The phone call supposedly came [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=41.6s)]
*  from a U.S. citizen who was serving as president of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  That alleged phone call became the central piece of evidence in the Steele dossier written [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=52.8s)]
*  by British ex spy Christopher Steele. That dossier in turn was a key piece of evidence [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  in the FBI's warrant applications to spy on the Trump campaign. The government leaked [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=63.28s)]
*  information on those supposedly secret warrant applications to the media and the Russian [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=68.84s)]
*  collusion narrative began. In January, BuzzFeed published the Steele dossier online. BuzzFeed's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=74.12s)]
*  editor justified publishing the document by saying the FBI was supposedly taking it [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=80.4s)]
*  seriously. This document that is being fought over and that by the way everybody except [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=85.4s)]
*  the public in a certain sense has seen, we've seen, you know, we don't have any special [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=91.04s)]
*  powers. At what point does the audience say we can see this too and we can deal with the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  fact that it is clearly labeled as unverified, that it's clearly labeled that some things [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=99.68s)]
*  in it aren't true, which is what we did. I kind of get it. I mean, so what you're saying [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=103.76s)]
*  is because famous people are gossiping about it and because other news organizations. Famous [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=107.6s)]
*  people, the President of the United States, the President-elect and the intelligence agencies. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  A famous person? We're not just talking garden variety famous people. Trust me, they gossip [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  too and by the way let me just note. It's not gossip. Official briefing, a document that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  by the way is a public document subject to the freedom of information law. Well actually [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=122.52s)]
*  in some sense it's gossip because it's unverified and the difference between what you did and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=126.84s)]
*  what Judge did was what Judge reported turned out to be true whereas it looks like what [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  you reported is not true. There were obvious red flags with the dossier from the very beginning. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=132.6s)]
*  For one thing, Christopher Steele was working for an opposition research firm called Fusion [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=137.56s)]
*  GPS, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the dossier made several obviously [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=142.28s)]
*  false claims. For example, it stated that the Trump campaign was working with hackers [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=148.08s)]
*  in the Russian consulate in Miami, but there is no Russian consulate in Miami, but for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=152.72s)]
*  partisan reasons, media personalities overlooked all that. They insisted the dossier was reliable. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=158.32s)]
*  The allegations in this Christopher Steele dossier, and you went through the timeline [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=165.24s)]
*  very well a few moments ago, are stunning. There are actually substantial portions of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=168.56s)]
*  what was in the Steele dossier, which was a raw intelligence document, that have indeed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=173.08s)]
*  checked out. Based on our own reporting and word from numerous official sources, the dossier [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  in fact is far from bogus. I think we're going to actually have to stop calling it the infamous [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  dossier. Increasingly, it's the accurate dossier. Today, thanks to an indictment from U.S. Attorney [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=187.0s)]
*  John Durham, we learn the truth. It turns out that there was no late July 26 phone call [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=192.88s)]
*  to Igor Denchenko about Russian collusion. Igor Denchenko wasn't speaking to the head [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce about Donald Trump or about anything at all. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=204.24s)]
*  Instead, according to today's indictment, the source of much of Denchenko's information [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=208.92s)]
*  was a Democratic party operative and a former Hillary Clinton advisor. We can identify that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=213.92s)]
*  Clinton advisor tonight. His name is Charles Dolan. In other words, Hillary Clinton's team [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=220.84s)]
*  wasn't just funding the Steele dossier, they were effectively writing it too. Dolan, by [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  the way, has extensive connections to Russia, closer connections than anybody on Donald [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=231.72s)]
*  Trump's team had. From 2006 to 2014, for example, Dolan did PR work on behalf of the Russian [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=236.72s)]
*  government and a Russian energy company. According to Durham's indictment, in August 2016, Denchenko [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  told Dolan that he was working on quote, a project against Trump, unquote. Dolan responded [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=249.84s)]
*  by saying he had just received dirt on Paul Manafort, who was Donald Trump's campaign [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=256.12s)]
*  manager at the time, from a quote, GOP friend. It was all a lie. According to today's indictment, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=260.72s)]
*  quote, Dolan later acknowledged to the FBI that he never met with a GOP friend in relation [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  to this information that he passed to Denchenko, but rather fabricated the fact of the meeting [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=274.38s)]
*  and his communications with Denchenko. Throughout 2016, Dolan and other political operatives [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=279.76s)]
*  continued to feed Denchenko more lies about the Trump campaign. The indictment states, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=285.52s)]
*  for example, that one of Denchenko's sources believed the ex-Clinton aide would quote, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=290.48s)]
*  take me to the State Department if Hillary wins. Denchenko himself also lied about traveling [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=295.28s)]
*  to the Moscow Hotel in the summer of 2016, a trip where he supposedly gathered information [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=302.28s)]
*  about the infamous P-Tain. Denchenko lied about all of this to the FBI. He never told [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=308.36s)]
*  them he was working for a former Hillary Clinton aide. So the big question is, how did Denchenko's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=314.32s)]
*  lies and all of his bogus conversations with these sources get into this Steele dossier? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=319.52s)]
*  Who connected Denchenko to Christopher Steele? Well, the indictment says that a member of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=326.08s)]
*  the National Security Council named Fiona Hill first introduced Denchenko to Steele. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=331.44s)]
*  If that name sounds familiar, it's because Fiona Hill was one of the Democratic Party's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=337.88s)]
*  witnesses against Donald Trump in his first impeachment trial. Now she's popped up again [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=341.56s)]
*  as one of the key figures behind the Steele dossier. That's either an incredible coincidence [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=347.64s)]
*  or a sign that our national security establishment is even more corrupt than we thought it was. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=353.8s)]
*  But it gets worse. The FBI, it turns out, knew for years that Denchenko's sourcing was [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=358.52s)]
*  They included his claims in search warrant applications against the Trump campaign. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  Regardless, declassified footnotes from a DOJ inspector general report revealed that the FBI [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  suspected Chris Steele's dossier was a part of an elaborate Russian disinformation campaign. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=375.96s)]
*  One of the footnotes said the bureau, quote, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  That subset referred to the activities of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=395.0s)]
*  who Steele's dossier claimed had traveled to Prague to meet with Russian agents. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=400.76s)]
*  Special counsel Robert Mueller couldn't find anything to support that claim, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=405.32s)]
*  and Cohen denied it. It was totally made up. Durham's indictment today makes it even more [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=409.4s)]
*  clear that the FBI knew the dossier was a scam. According to today's indictment, June 2017, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  FBI agents interviewed Denchenko in Virginia. Agents asked Denchenko about his contacts with [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=423.24s)]
*  the Clinton aide Charles Dolan. Denchenko lied and said he didn't talk to Dolan. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=428.68s)]
*  The FBI agent documented at the time he knew it was a lie, but nothing happened. The FBI didn't [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=433.56s)]
*  prosecute Denchenko. Robert Mueller didn't even mention any of this in his report. Until today, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  until John Durham's indictment, no one in the government did a thing. Now Denchenko faces [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=446.6s)]
*  five federal charges, including lying to the FBI to hide his conversations with Dolan. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=452.84s)]
*  And this could just be the beginning. We're learning a lot about the collusion hoax very [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=459.32s)]
*  quickly. Weeks ago, John Durham indicted DNC lawyer named Michael Sussman for lying to the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=463.79999999999995s)]
*  FBI about a secret channel of communications between the Trump organization and a Russian bank. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  Durham has also secured a guilty plea from an ex-FBI attorney who lied about the Trump [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=475.88s)]
*  campaign's ties to Russia. Now we're learning that Hillary Clinton allies gave information to a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=481.16s)]
*  Hillary Clinton contractor and laundered it, all of it, into the FBI and the Department of Justice. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=487.08000000000004s)]
*  More than four years after that fabricated July 26 phone call, some of these criminals [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=494.52000000000004s)]
*  are finally going to jail. Kim Strassel is a columnist [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADIwK5rNUw&t=501.08000000000004s)]
