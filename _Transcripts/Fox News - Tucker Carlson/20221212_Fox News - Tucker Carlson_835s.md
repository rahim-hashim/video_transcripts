# Tucker Carlson: Pete Buttigieg learned some roads are too racist to fix
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we're coming up on the two year anniversary [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  of the Biden administration. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=3.9s)]
*  If you can even believe it, seems like a day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=4.76s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg has been there almost the whole time. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=7.76s)]
*  He was sworn in in early February of 2021. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=9.6s)]
*  And when he was, he had high hopes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=12.8s)]
*  We looked at the tape today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=14.84s)]
*  Though we had no previous experience with transportation, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=16.28s)]
*  or for that matter, with secretarial work, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=18.56s)]
*  Buttigieg held up his right hand [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  and swore an oath to Kamala Harris [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=22.04s)]
*  to be the best darn secretary of transportation he could be. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=23.88s)]
*  And he seemed to mean it, but not for long. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=27.68s)]
*  Sadly, history soon intervened. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=29.96s)]
*  Just weeks into the job, Buttigieg discovered [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=31.92s)]
*  that some of the roads he was supposed to be overseeing, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=34.42s)]
*  the roads he was now secretary of, were in fact racist. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  And not just low grade, got drunk, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=41.0s)]
*  and wrote an insensitive Facebook post 10 years ago racist. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=42.96s)]
*  Not that kind of racism, no. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=45.56s)]
*  These were hardcore David Duke level, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=47.2s)]
*  nasty old segregationist roads. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  These were roads that refused to respond to reason [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=51.36s)]
*  and clearly had no intention of changing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=54.24s)]
*  and joined the 21st century. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=56.28s)]
*  Some of these roads literally had white stripes [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  painted on them, white stripes, Jim Crow stuff. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  Buttigieg seemed shocked by the whole thing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=66.0s)]
*  They don't have roads like that back in South Bend, Indiana. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=67.52s)]
*  So for Pete Buttigieg, it was a pivot point. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=70.7s)]
*  It was one of those moments of profound disillusionment, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=72.56s)]
*  so common to high-minded young newcomers to Washington, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=74.94s)]
*  where everything changes in an instant. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=78.3s)]
*  All your preconceptions washed away. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=80.1s)]
*  Here he'd sworn an oath to take care of the roads, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  but learned the hard way that some roads are beyond repair. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=84.82s)]
*  They are too racist to fix. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=87.36s)]
*  So Pete Buttigieg embarked on another path. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=90.04s)]
*  He became one of America's foremost religious leaders. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=92.48s)]
*  As an Episcopalian, it was not an easy transition. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=96.0s)]
*  Traditionally, members of the clergy believe in God, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=98.56s)]
*  but Buttigieg had a characteristically clever solution, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=101.32s)]
*  an approach he had learned during his years [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=104.24s)]
*  as a McKinsey consultant. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=105.72s)]
*  In place of the concept of an omnipotent, loving God [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=107.56s)]
*  who brings justice to the world, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=110.2s)]
*  Buttigieg simply substituted the word climate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=111.72s)]
*  Thanks be to climate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=114.88s)]
*  Our climate, who art in heaven, that kind of thing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=116.36s)]
*  And it sounded pretty good. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  Here's one of his sermons. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  You talk very openly about being a person of faith, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  and I want to understand how you connect that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  to this issue of climate change [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=129.04s)]
*  and our custodianship of the Earth [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=131.72s)]
*  and our moral responsibilities. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=134.24s)]
*  Climate is a moral issue, and this is about stewardship. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  It is about justice. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=140.4s)]
*  There's a moment here where we should invite [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  those who are motivated by religious moral considerations [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=143.92s)]
*  to know that those are some of the things [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=149.6s)]
*  that are at stake in what we're doing to this planet. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=151.56s)]
*  So this was really a milestone in modern Christian theology. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=156.2s)]
*  Climate, declared Father Buttigieg, is a moral issue, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  not a meteorological matter, not even a policy topic. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a moral issue. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=165.92s)]
*  Climate is a question that bears directly [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  on the fate of your mortal soul. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=169.04s)]
*  When you mistreat the climate, you risk damnation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=171.08s)]
*  In so much as you have done to the least of these, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=174.24s)]
*  you have done it to the climate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  Big change. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=178.84s)]
*  You thought it was about the science. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=179.68s)]
*  Actually, it's about morality. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=180.5s)]
*  Okay, Reverend Peet, so you set the terms here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=182.08s)]
*  So how's your climate record? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=185.38000000000002s)]
*  That seems like a fair question, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  given that you've just told us that we will go to hell [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=188.4s)]
*  for our carbon emissions. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=190.56s)]
*  So let's see how you're doing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Fox News Digital just got ahold [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=194.24s)]
*  of the Reverend Peet's travel schedule, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  a list of trips he's taken since getting the job [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=197.84s)]
*  at the transportation department. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=199.72s)]
*  And it turns out that Reverend Peet [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=201.48s)]
*  is the Jimmy Swagger of climate clergy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=204.04s)]
*  He was commanding you not to do it, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=207.2s)]
*  at the same time he was doing it himself in a very big way, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=209.28s)]
*  way more than you've ever thought of doing it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Reverend Peet has sinned. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=214.36s)]
*  Oh boy, has he, in a dark and very naughty way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=216.18s)]
*  In less than two years, Buttigieg has flown private [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=219.68s)]
*  at taxpayer expense nearly 20 times. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=223.36s)]
*  He's jetted to Ohio and Florida and New Hampshire, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=226.04s)]
*  among other places. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=228.2s)]
*  In September, Buttigieg took an FAA jet [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=229.64s)]
*  to a Canadian gay rights ceremony [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=232.16s)]
*  to accept an award for his LGBTQ plus advocacy, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=233.68s)]
*  something else he's been doing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  since he gave up on the roads. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=238.24s)]
*  All this has been extremely expensive for you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=240.28s)]
*  and every other taxpayer. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=242.16s)]
*  You may recall that Donald Trump's HHS secretary, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=243.4s)]
*  Tom Price, lost his job for doing exactly the same thing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=246.14s)]
*  An outragedpolitico.com drove him out of office. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  So it's expensive, but that's not the real crime. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=254.18s)]
*  The real crime here is against the climate. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=257.36s)]
*  It's a sin, it's a moral transgression [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=260.32s)]
*  because none of these planes [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=262.02000000000004s)]
*  that Buttigieg was jetting around on were solar powered. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=264.32s)]
*  Not a single one ran on a windmill [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=268.22s)]
*  or recycled French fry oil. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=271.24s)]
*  They were all fossil fueled, all of them. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=273.36s)]
*  And there is likely no mode of transportation [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=277.0s)]
*  in the history of machines [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=279.36s)]
*  that emits more carbon than private air travel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  That would include long trips across India [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  on coal-fired locomotives. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=285.12s)]
*  Private jet travel stands alone. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=286.92s)]
*  Private jets emit an average of two tons of carbon dioxide [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=288.6s)]
*  in an hour, per hour. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=292.56s)]
*  For perspective, that's 14 times more carbon emissions [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  per passenger than the JetBlue flight you're on [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=299.32s)]
*  or any other commercial flight. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=302.32s)]
*  So you might as well start a tire fire to heat your house. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=304.18s)]
*  That would be better for the atmosphere [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=307.24s)]
*  than what Pete Buttigieg is doing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  Traveling by private jet is literally the last thing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=311.72s)]
*  that Father Pete should ever do, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=314.48s)]

*  You may remember that last year when Pete Buttigieg [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=320.24s)]
*  was busted commuting in a carbon belching SUV, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=322.64s)]
*  one of the vehicles that destroys the climate, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=326.64s)]
*  then unloading a bicycle from the backseat [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  for a short, widely photographed ride to the White House. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=330.72s)]
*  You're seeing that footage on your screen now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=333.6s)]
*  Now that should have been the very first tip [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=335.92s)]
*  that Reverend Pete's sermons [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  and the self-described climate activists [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=339.7s)]
*  who applauded those sermons are all entirely fraudulent. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=341.34s)]
*  And in fact, they are fraudulent. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=345.61999999999995s)]
*  Roughly half of all emission created by airplanes [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=347.94s)]
*  are emitted by the richest 1% of the population [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=351.73999999999995s)]
*  flying private, the right majority of these, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  Biden voters and big fans of, you guessed it, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=356.58s)]
*  the Reverend Pete Buttigieg. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=359.76s)]
*  This year alone, to pick but one among many examples, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=361.97999999999996s)]
*  Steven Spielberg, who said he's terrified of climate change, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=364.58s)]
*  emitted over 4,400 metric tons of carbon from private jets. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=367.9s)]
*  How much is that? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=375.02s)]
*  That's 600 times more emissions [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  than the average person emits in a year. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=377.73999999999995s)]
*  Another climate activist, Taylor Swift, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=381.02s)]
*  nearly doubled Steven Spielberg's total, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=382.94s)]
*  8,000 metric tons of CO2 in a year, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=385.84s)]
*  all of them destroying the planet, rising the seas, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=390.2s)]
*  an offense against Mother Earth. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=393.0s)]
*  Now, Taylor Swift justified it by saying, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh, I loan out jets sometimes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=396.3s)]
*  Oh, it's okay. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=397.9s)]
*  But it's not okay, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=399.82s)]
*  not if you claim to believe in climate change. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=400.65999999999997s)]
*  A 50-minute flight on a private jet can emit as much carbon [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=402.86s)]
*  as the average person's car does over an entire year. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=406.92s)]
*  50 minutes! [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=410.98s)]
*  So imagine what a flight from DC to LAX does, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=413.09999999999997s)]
*  or more likely from Hamptons to Aspen. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=416.14s)]
*  And then imagine thousands and thousands, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=419.46s)]
*  tens of thousands of these flights, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=422.02s)]
*  all carrying people who claim they believe [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=424.08s)]
*  that climate change is, quote, existential. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=426.96s)]
*  It's not a mistake, it's intentional, it's a statement, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=430.16s)]
*  and it's quite a statement if you think about it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=432.7s)]
*  If you're yapping about carbon emissions and climate, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  and then flying private, what you're really doing [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=438.04s)]
*  is hoisting a screaming middle finger to the country, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=440.64s)]
*  to the plebes below in their SUVs, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=444.04s)]
*  which you say you plan to ban. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=446.32s)]
*  And not just in this country, we've got it easy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=449.3s)]
*  The economies of entire nations around the world [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=451.8s)]
*  are being destroyed right now [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=454.14s)]
*  in the name of fighting climate change [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=455.78s)]
*  at the behest of people who fly private. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  So people are going hungry and freezing to death [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  around the world so that Pete Buttigieg and his friends [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=462.18s)]
*  won't have to walk through the magnetometer [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=464.41999999999996s)]
*  at the TSA checkpoint. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=465.86s)]
*  I'm gonna mean to sing out the Reverend Pete, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=467.82s)]
*  though he is certainly the most self-righteous of the group. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=469.82s)]
*  They're all doing it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=473.38s)]
*  Is there a single high-level climate activist [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=474.5s)]
*  who doesn't fly private? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  At the recent climate summit, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=478.53999999999996s)]
*  more than 400 attendees flew in privately, not on JetBlue, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=479.9s)]
*  in their own planes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=484.02s)]
*  Jeff Bezos is one of them. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=485.41999999999996s)]
*  He flew in his private jet, so did Boris Johnson. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=486.41999999999996s)]
*  John Kerry was famously busted [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=489.02s)]
*  flying to a climate summit in Iceland [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=490.53999999999996s)]
*  on his personal Gulfstream. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=492.52s)]
*  But don't worry, he had no choice. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  He's too important. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=497.88s)]
*  It's the only choice for somebody like me [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=499.18s)]
*  who is traveling the world to win this battle. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=502.06s)]
*  I believe the time it takes me to get somewhere, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=505.14s)]
*  I can't sail across the ocean. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=508.18s)]
*  I have to fly to meet with people and get things done. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=509.58s)]
*  Oh, someone like me. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=513.8s)]
*  You never heard of Zoom, pal? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=515.64s)]
*  You should be in jail by your own standards. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=516.92s)]
*  You're a climate criminal. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=519.76s)]

*  Not just him. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=529.2199999999999s)]
*  Virtually every recognizable person [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=530.06s)]
*  in American politics and entertainment flies private. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=531.5999999999999s)]

*  You know who flies private? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=538.52s)]
*  A lot. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=539.3599999999999s)]
*  Al Gore flies private. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=540.4s)]
*  Michael Bloomberg, boy, does he fly private. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  In a four year period, the UN climate envoy, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  Mr. Bloomberg, took more than 1700 private flights [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=547.76s)]
*  burning more than 10,000 metric tons of CO2. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=552.4399999999999s)]
*  You could never do that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=556.7199999999999s)]
*  If you filled your yard with diesel engines [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=559.5799999999999s)]
*  and never turned them off, you would not do that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  Your car emits less than five metric tons of CO2 a year. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=564.7199999999999s)]
*  So this is meaningful. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  This is an actual offense against Mother Earth [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=571.88s)]
*  and the climate. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=574.8s)]
*  So you have to wonder what the defenders [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=576.28s)]
*  of climate think of this. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=577.64s)]
*  What about the climate warriors at Greenpeace [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=578.52s)]
*  and the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=580.68s)]
*  Have they noticed this? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=582.92s)]
*  Not really. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=583.76s)]
*  Have they scolded their donors [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=585.32s)]
*  for undermining their core message? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=587.12s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=589.88s)]
*  Catherine Clark, the incoming Democratic Party house whip [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=592.32s)]
*  doesn't complain either. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=595.98s)]
*  She should be because her own child has nightmares [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=598.34s)]
*  about climate change. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=601.1s)]
*  Let me tell you what it means to me [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=603.46s)]
*  coming in as a different generation. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=606.76s)]
*  I remember my middle child waking up with nightmares [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=609.82s)]
*  over concern around climate change. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=613.94s)]
*  Okay, so you terrorized your own children. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=617.5400000000001s)]
*  You scared the crap out of little kids about climate. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=619.62s)]
*  So you must be very upset about what Pete Buttigieg [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=622.76s)]
*  is doing to climate by flying private, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=625.7s)]
*  which is the most destructive thing you can do to climate [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=629.78s)]
*  other than signing off on the sabotage [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=632.86s)]
*  of a Russian natural gas pipeline, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=635.5799999999999s)]
*  which I guess they also did, but who's noticing? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=637.26s)]
*  But she's not worried about it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=641.42s)]
*  Catherine Clark doesn't care. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=642.26s)]
*  Another two are donors, including the environmental activists [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=643.1s)]
*  who send her all that money. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=645.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, a lot of young people [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=647.18s)]
*  are very upset about climate. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=648.5799999999999s)]
*  They believe Pete Buttigieg. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=649.98s)]
*  And you know what they're doing? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=652.02s)]
*  They're destroying some of the greatest artwork [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=652.86s)]
*  in Western civilization because they want you to know [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=654.22s)]
*  how important the climate is. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=657.02s)]
*  It shows the destructive nature of our addiction to oil. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=659.78s)]
*  During these times of catastrophic climate change [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=669.3399999999999s)]
*  is needed now more than ever. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=672.3399999999999s)]
*  What is worth more, art or life? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=679.3399999999999s)]
*  We cannot afford new oil and gas. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=683.3399999999999s)]
*  It is not worth more. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=686.3399999999999s)]
*  New oil and gas is going to take everything we know and love. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=688.5s)]
*  So groups like that, those thugs, those monsters, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=693.58s)]
*  the Stalinist mobs didn't appear out of nowhere. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=697.98s)]
*  It's not organic, of course. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=700.1s)]
*  They were whipped into a frenzy by John Kerry [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=701.86s)]
*  and Nancy Pelosi and Pete Buttigieg. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=704.62s)]
*  Those were their inspiration. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=706.94s)]
*  But what's interesting is they're destroying the things [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=709.1s)]
*  that are most valuable in our society, our art, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=711.38s)]
*  the legacy of our civilization. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=714.5400000000001s)]
*  But you know what they haven't done? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=717.14s)]
*  They haven't said a single word about Al Gore's [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=719.1s)]
*  personal Gulf Stream or John Kerry's or Pete Buttigieg. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=721.86s)]
*  That's weird, isn't it? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=725.98s)]
*  They're attacking our civilization's art, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=727.66s)]
*  but they're not saying anything about the people [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=730.5s)]
*  who are actually destroying the climate. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=732.4200000000001s)]
*  And you knew else isn't BlackRock. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=735.34s)]
*  The ESG score that you keep hearing about? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=737.4200000000001s)]
*  Your flights on private planes have no effect [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=741.26s)]
*  on an ESG score, really? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=743.26s)]
*  The E is for environment. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=744.82s)]
*  But BlackRock doesn't say a word. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=747.1s)]
*  Could it be that the climate movement isn't really [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=749.38s)]
*  about the climate or about the environment? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=752.38s)]
*  Could it be that the climate movement is really [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=754.7s)]
*  about creating a permanent caste system [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=756.7s)]
*  where the people at the top of society, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=759.14s)]
*  the Brahmins, can do literally whatever they want, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=760.9s)]
*  can violate with impunity the standards they impose [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=764.74s)]
*  on others while endlessly lecturing and oppressing [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=767.1800000000001s)]
*  the population that supposedly runs the country [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=770.12s)]
*  but of course actually doesn't? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=772.1800000000001s)]
*  Could it be? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=774.14s)]
*  Ooh, it's possible. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=775.14s)]
*  We called Pete Buttigieg's office today and asked, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=776.5s)]
*  how you can justify flying private as the earth warms [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=778.38s)]
*  and the seas rise? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=781.46s)]
*  How are you not a climate criminal? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=782.62s)]
*  Speak slowly so we can understand. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=784.5s)]
*  Of course they didn't explain. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=787.1s)]
*  But the rest of us should impose this [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=788.98s)]
*  as a litmus test going forward. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=790.44s)]
*  No one who seeks to impose carbon rationing [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=792.38s)]
*  on another human being should ever be allowed [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=795.18s)]
*  to step within 100 yards of a private aircraft, period. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=797.82s)]
*  Anyone who claims to be serious about fighting [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=802.22s)]
*  climate change should demand tomorrow morning [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=804.5400000000001s)]
*  a federal law against private air travel. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=806.82s)]
*  Make it illegal, it's that simple. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=810.0600000000001s)]
*  Then go ahead and fly commercial with everyone else [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=812.14s)]
*  or stay home. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=814.1s)]
*  What's the argument against that? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=815.98s)]
*  Well, here's what you do know. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  Anyone who lectures you about climate [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=819.14s)]
*  and opposes banning private air travel [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=820.5400000000001s)]
*  is a total fraud and should be ignored. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHKyVQcJHro&t=822.64s)]
