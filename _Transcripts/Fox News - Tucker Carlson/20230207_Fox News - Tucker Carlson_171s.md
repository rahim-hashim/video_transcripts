# Rufo: This FSU initiative is dividing Americans based on race
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ)
*  Chris Ruffo tirelessly is on this. He broke this story. He's a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. Chris, thanks so much for coming on. So I just have to ask you once again, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=5.36s)]
*  how is this, which is so obviously illegal under federal and state laws, all 50 states, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=11.44s)]
*  how is this allowed? Well, it shouldn't be, but it's allowed because these are people who have [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=16.72s)]
*  power. They've expanded in the universities with these so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=23.28s)]
*  programs, and no one is challenging them from within the institution. And so that's why I'm [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=27.44s)]
*  doing this investigative series. I'm exposing it. We're going to put pressure on these folks [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=32.0s)]
*  because what they're doing is quite simple. They're dividing Americans, or in this case, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=36.08s)]
*  students at Florida State, along what they call a matrix of oppression. They're designating some [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=39.6s)]
*  groups, oppressors, other groups, oppressed, and they're creating special benefits and special [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=44.24s)]
*  punishments based on your identity. It's wrong. We have them scrambling. And the more we expose it, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  the more we put pressure on them, the more that we could stamp out this racialist ideology that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=54.96s)]
*  is capturing all of our institutions. Well, and it's just, it's directly opposed to the America that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=60.32s)]
*  normal people want to live in of all colors, by the way. You're not prepared for this. I'm just [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=67.44s)]
*  throwing this at you. I just read today that you've been appointed to the board of a college by [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=71.52s)]
*  Governor DeSantis in Florida. And in a minute 30, can you sum up what it's a very interesting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=75.44s)]
*  story? Can you sum up what you're doing and what that is? Yeah, I was appointed along with [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=80.64s)]
*  six other trustees to take over the new college of Florida. It's the smallest public university [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=85.68s)]
*  in the system. On our first board meeting, we fired the president. We let go of the general [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=90.64s)]
*  council. We switched the board chair and we're going to implement top to bottom reforms at [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=95.6s)]
*  this university. We're going to be bringing a classical liberal arts education and demonstrating [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=99.76s)]
*  it's time for conservatives to get tough. It's time for when we win elections to actually [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=104.8s)]
*  start changing institutions. And we're not just simply going to be the caretakers of left-wing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=109.84s)]
*  ideology. We're taking action. Governor Ron DeSantis is leading the way and I'm proud to be part [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=115.04s)]
*  of this movement. So you're not waiting around for a report from the current administration at this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=120.16s)]
*  college? No, we're acting very quickly. And I think you're going to see dramatic changes right [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=125.84s)]
*  from the outset. And look, we're following the governor's lead. This is a guy who has a bold [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=132.56s)]
*  vision, takes courageous action. And really the thing that I hope to demonstrate in this experiment [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=137.04s)]
*  taking over this college is political courage because that's what we need as conservatives. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=142.0s)]
*  It's time to stop just doing white papers, talking to each other. It's time to take action. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  You know, John Durham is going to do a report in the next 10 years. So just hold tight. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  Chris Ruffo, great to see you. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=156.88s)]
*  opens, stories that are changing the world and changing your life. From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz8BMijJPMQ&t=164.48s)]
