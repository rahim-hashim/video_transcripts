# Tucker blasts Rep. Kinzinger for Ukraine tweet: 'Get some respect, buffoon’ #shorts
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY)
*  getting buffoons like Adam Kinzinger sitting in his office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=0.0s)]
*  making bellicose noises on social media. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=3.04s)]
*  Just the other day, Kinzinger posted images on Twitter [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=5.2s)]
*  of a Ukrainian air ace called the Ghost of Kiev. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=7.68s)]
*  He downed Russian Migs left and right. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=10.8s)]
*  Well, it turns out the whole thing was a hoax, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=13.52s)]
*  but of course Adam Kinzinger had no idea [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  because he knows nothing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=16.88s)]
*  Quote, the Ghost of Kiev has a name [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=17.84s)]
*  and he has absolutely owned the Russian Air Force, he tweeted. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=19.76s)]
*  Imagine a sitting member of Congress [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=22.96s)]
*  tweeting about a war like it's a cable news segment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=25.04s)]
*  He absolutely owned the Russian Air Force. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=27.76s)]
*  Really? Get some respect. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=29.44s)]
*  People are dying buffoon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=31.92s)]
*  Kinzinger then attached an obviously photoshopped image [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=35.2s)]
*  of the comedian Sam Hyde sitting in the cockpit of a fighter jet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  Sam Hyde, for the record, is not a Ukrainian fighter ace. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=40.72s)]
*  He is once again a comedian. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=43.52s)]
*  That was Adam Kinzinger. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=46.08s)]
*  These are the people pushing us toward a new world war. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  So at the very least, let's pause and think this through. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRi9nQV_7uY&t=49.6s)]
