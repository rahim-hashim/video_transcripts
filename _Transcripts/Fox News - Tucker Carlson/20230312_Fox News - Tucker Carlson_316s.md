# Tucker: This video shatters the left’s narrative about January 6
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g)
*  Within hours of January 6th, literally hours, you began to hear that day described as a deadly insurrection, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=0.0s)]
*  and not described by one news outlet or one politician, but in unison by all of them, almost like it was coordinated. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=8.6s)]
*  A deadly insurrection. That's how history may record January 6th. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=16.0s)]
*  But the tape that we reviewed from within the building on that day proves it was neither an insurrection nor deadly. Here it is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=22.0s)]
*  January 6th, when an estimated 2,000 rioters breached the Capitol building, causing the deaths of five police officers. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=32.0s)]
*  Certain dates echo throughout history. December 7th, 1941, September 11th, 2001, and January 6th. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=41.0s)]
*  The mob beat officers with anything they had on them. Hockey stick, flagpole, a fire extinguisher. Police officers died. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=53.0s)]
*  Donald Trump supporters who, of course, rioted and killed police officers. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=60.0s)]
*  By the evening of January 6th, the Democratic Party and its publicists in the national news media had settled on a description of what had happened that day. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=66.0s)]
*  They distilled an enormous number of highly complex events, events that even now we don't fully understand, into a single, emotionally-related political slogan, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=75.0s)]
*  which they've repeated for years with remarkable discipline. January 6th, they said, was a deadly insurrection. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=85.0s)]
*  There was a deadly insurrection that the right wing is trying to cover up. He incited a deadly insurrection. Incited a deadly insurrection. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=92.0s)]
*  The violent, deadly insurrection on the Capitol nine months ago was about white supremacy, in my view. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=98.0s)]
*  A deadly insurrection. Everything about that phrase is a lie. Very little about January 6th was organized or violent. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=104.0s)]
*  Surveillance video from inside the Capitol shows mostly peaceful chaos. But the slogan worked. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=113.0s)]
*  The term deadly carries enormous emotional power, which is why they used it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=119.0s)]
*  To prove the insurrection was deadly, propagandists pointed to the death of an officer called Brian Sicknick. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=124.0s)]
*  The mob killed Officer Brian Sicknick. That's what they said. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=130.0s)]
*  It was their single most powerful indictment of the January 6th protesters and of Donald Trump and of Republican voters nationally. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=134.0s)]
*  They repeated that claim for years. They are still repeating it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=142.0s)]
*  At first, they told the country that Officer Sicknick was murdered with a fire extinguisher. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=146.0s)]
*  Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the fight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=150.0s)]
*  That story came from The New York Times, which is effectively the assignment editor for most of the rest of American media. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=154.0s)]
*  It was a lie, untrue in any way. But only after that lie had hardened into conventional wisdom did the newspaper bother to retract it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=161.0s)]
*  The New York Times has quietly retracted its story about the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=170.0s)]
*  The damage had been done. Brian Sicknick, himself a Trump voter, had been transformed without his consent into a political martyr of the left. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=176.0s)]
*  His memory was shamelessly exploited by the incoming Biden administration. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=186.0s)]
*  In February of 2021, Sicknick's body lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda, where a parade of unscrupulous politicians made use of it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=190.0s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=199.0s)]
*  Breaking down the doors, trying to overturn an outcome of election, and killing several police officers in the meantime. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=201.0s)]
*  But Brian Sicknick should not be reduced to a prop for the political ambitions of the Democratic Party. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=208.0s)]
*  He was a human being. The facts of his life matter, including how he died. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=214.0s)]
*  To this day, media accounts describe Sicknick as someone who was, quote, slain on January 6. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=219.0s)]
*  The video we reviewed proves that is a lie. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=225.0s)]
*  Here is surveillance footage of Sicknick walking in the Capitol after he was supposedly murdered by the mob outside. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=228.0s)]
*  By all appearances, Sicknick is healthy and vigorous. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=235.0s)]
*  He's wearing a helmet, so it's hard to imagine he was killed by a head injury. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=238.0s)]
*  Whatever happened to Brian Sicknick was very obviously not the result of violence he suffered at the entrance to the Capitol. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=242.0s)]
*  This tape overturns the single most powerful and politically useful lie the Democrats have told us about January 6. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=250.0s)]
*  And it was indeed a lie. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=258.0s)]
*  The January 6 committee knew perfectly well that Brian Sicknick was walking normally through the Capitol after he was supposedly murdered by Trump supporters. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=260.0s)]
*  And they know that because they saw this tape. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=269.0s)]
*  We can be sure because the footage contains an electronic bookmark that is still archived in the Capitol's computer system. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=272.0s)]
*  That means that investigators working for the Democratic Party reviewed this tape. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=279.0s)]
*  They saw it. But they refused to release the tape to the public. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=284.0s)]
*  Why? Because this tape would shatter the fraud they were perpetrating on the country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=288.0s)]
*  Because hiding the truth served their political interest. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=293.0s)]
*  They lied about the police officer they claimed to revere. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=297.0s)]
*  If they were willing to do that, then their dishonesty knew no limits. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1At8Lg_1g&t=300.0s)]
