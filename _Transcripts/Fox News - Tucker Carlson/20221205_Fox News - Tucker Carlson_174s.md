# Kari Lake: This is the propaganda arm of our government
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU)
*  Keri Lake joins us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=0.0s)]
*  Keri, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=1.56s)]
*  Did you, I mean, I assume you must have suspected [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=3.8200000000000003s)]
*  something like this was happening. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=6.36s)]
*  How do you feel now that it's been confirmed? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=8.0s)]
*  Well, nothing surprises me now, to be honest, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=11.3s)]
*  but this did, I was a little bit surprised. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=13.86s)]
*  I mean, we saw what happened with Hunter's laptop in 2020. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=16.16s)]
*  The DNC is behind it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=19.88s)]
*  Biden's people are behind it, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=21.22s)]
*  keeping the narrative away from discussing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=22.94s)]
*  the disturbing contents of that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=25.04s)]
*  So it shouldn't be surprising that states are doing this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=26.88s)]
*  And my opponent, who I wanted to recuse herself [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=30.52s)]
*  from the election more than a year ago [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=33.56s)]
*  because of conflict of interest, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=35.76s)]
*  it wouldn't surprise me if her office [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=37.54s)]
*  was trying to silence people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=39.08s)]
*  I mean, we got silenced. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=40.48s)]
*  At one point, my Twitter page got taken down [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=41.84s)]
*  because they didn't like one of the tweets I put up [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  during the election. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=46.56s)]
*  It makes me wonder who was behind that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=47.44s)]
*  We had to remove a tweet during the election [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  in order to get our ability to communicate [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=52.28s)]
*  with our followers and the people who were supporting us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=54.96s)]
*  It is frightening what's happening with Twitter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  This is an arm, it's a propaganda arm of our government. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  And we need to wake up right now [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=63.72s)]
*  and demand that we get some control [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=66.4s)]
*  over what's happening in our government. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=68.9s)]
*  The FBI, and you know, we're talking about Twitter tonight. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=70.16s)]
*  Let's talk Facebook. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=72.92s)]
*  What about TikTok? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=73.88s)]
*  This thing is gonna go so deep [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=75.4s)]
*  that I think people are gonna be shocked [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=77.32s)]
*  when they learn the full extent. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=79.26s)]
*  I can't wait to hear what they were doing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=80.6s)]
*  when it comes to censoring us on COVID. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  When people's lives were at risk, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=84.72s)]
*  when our children were being masked up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=86.28s)]
*  Shocking. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=88.96s)]
*  And with vaccines. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=90.34s)]
*  Really quick, how can you have a democracy [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=91.6s)]
*  in a country where the government is suppressing speech? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=93.64s)]
*  How can that be a democratic country? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=98.2s)]
*  I believe it's called fascism, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=101.8s)]
*  and they're always accusing us of being the fascist one. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=103.16s)]
*  And you know, they spent three years talking [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=105.48s)]
*  about Russia, Russia, Russia, the collusion story, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=107.8s)]
*  and they didn't wanna talk about Hunter's laptop. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=110.2s)]
*  They didn't wanna talk about problems with our elections [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=113.48s)]
*  that we discovered in 2020, and we saw repeated in 22. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  When are we gonna have a serious discussion [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=120.16s)]
*  about what's really wrong in this country? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=122.44s)]
*  We don't have a lot of time left on the clock. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  And you know, as Twitter said, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=126.44s)]
*  what was the term they used? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=128.28s)]
*  We're on it, we're gonna get on it right away. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=130.8s)]
*  Well, we're getting on it in Arizona, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=133.0s)]
*  and the people have had enough. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=134.84s)]
*  We're sick of the Katie Hobbs office [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=136.62s)]
*  and the Secretary of State's office [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=139.8s)]
*  and what they've been up to. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=141.32s)]
*  And we're gonna start fighting back, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=142.52s)]
*  and we're gonna be drawing up some lawsuits in our election [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  because we won't have elections that are run [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  like they're run in third world countries. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=149.12s)]
*  We have too much to save in this country [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  to allow our elections to be run that way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=153.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, Godspeed, I think all, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  I would hope all people would agree with that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=158.4s)]
*  Carrie Lake, great to see you tonight, thank you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2i0RnMNBU&t=160.42000000000002s)]
