# This is how Hillary Clinton broke federal law: Patel
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8)
*  Cash Patel is a former national security adviser to the House Intel Committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight to sort out what the second part of this story means. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=4.08s)]
*  Cash Patel, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=7.28s)]
*  So how should we understand this fine of the Hillary Clinton campaign? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=9.6s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=13.84s)]
*  So the main thing to take away is that the Hillary Clinton campaign broke federal law. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=15.82s)]
*  That's why they levied this fine. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=20.84s)]
*  When I was leading the Russiagate investigation, we had to get a subpoena from Congress to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=22.12s)]
*  get the bank records to show that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Dems paid for the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=25.8s)]
*  Steele dossier. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=30.04s)]
*  And three years later, the FEC finally woke up and said, yes, that's illegal and we need [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=31.6s)]
*  to find them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=36.28s)]
*  Had any other campaign done it, they would have fined them to the tune of tens of millions [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=37.28s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=40.68s)]
*  But I'll take this as a start. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=41.68s)]
*  But the biggest takeaway is the Hillary Clinton campaign broke federal law by taking political [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=42.84s)]
*  contributions and paying a foreign asset to gin up dirty Russian information that was [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  fake that they funneled into the FBI to falsely surveil President Trump under illegal [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  warrants issued by the Federal Surveillance Court. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=58.14s)]
*  So the whole thing was a scam. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=61.3s)]
*  It was illegal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=63.06s)]
*  They'd been fined for it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=64.06s)]
*  It wouldn't have worked unless the entire Washington press corps abetted it, went along [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=65.34s)]
*  with it, reported the stuff as true. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=69.72s)]
*  And it was fact. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=71.86s)]
*  It was just another set of campaign lies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=72.86s)]
*  It was oppo. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=74.3s)]
*  Has anybody apologized for their roles in this? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=75.8s)]
*  I don't think those 51 Intel analysts, the heads of the CIA, they called Hunter Biden's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=80.42s)]
*  laptop Russian information have apologized. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=85.14s)]
*  They actually doubled down and said they were glad to give the warning, even though it had [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=87.22000000000001s)]
*  been proven wrong. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=90.7s)]
*  Hillary Clinton and the Steele team and Fusion GPS have not apologized, even though her lawyers [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=91.7s)]
*  for the campaign have been indicted by special counsel John Durham. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=96.5s)]
*  So federal indictments, federal fines showing corruption and a breaking of the federal law [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=99.98s)]
*  is not enough for the mainstream media to come around and say not only did they get [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  it wrong, but they got it so wrong that they need to be calling out the Hillary Clinton [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  campaign. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=112.7s)]
*  And now probably Joe Biden or actually his son Hunter, because these people have been [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=114.38s)]
*  corrupting the media for decades and they are supposed to be the bastions, the dynastic [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=117.9s)]
*  bastions of Democratic, of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=122.34s)]
*  And they have failed in upholding the principles of the law, which we, you and I have reported [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=125.5s)]
*  on for so long. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=129.82s)]
*  Well, and they they prevented us from having a free and fair election in 2020 by suppressing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=130.82s)]
*  information voters needed to know. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=135.34s)]
*  And the people who did that, those 51 former Intel officials all still have their security [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=136.62s)]
*  clearances, which they used to make millions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=140.7s)]
*  They trade on those clearances. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=142.26s)]
*  Why do they still have their security clearances? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=144.38s)]
*  They don't work for the government anymore. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=145.61999999999998s)]
*  They work for MSNBC. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=147.42s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=150.06s)]
*  And it's not it's not a law that they have them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=151.06s)]
*  They are. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  It's a regulation and those can be revoked immediately and they should be revoked immediately [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  because they were spreading as former cabinet secretary's lies about political operatives [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=157.04s)]
*  that they favored one over the other. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=162.5s)]
*  And they got an election. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  They got a presidential candidate and Joe Biden to come out during an election and say, look, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=165.89999999999998s)]
*  three CIA directors, a director of the NSA and a secretary of defense said, my son's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=171.3s)]
*  laptop is Russian disinformation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=175.14s)]
*  So so much of the American public believed them and they were all lying and they knew [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=177.38s)]
*  it because they didn't have access to the Intel then. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=181.7s)]
*  And they don't have it now and they should have their security clearances revoked immediately. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=184.78s)]
*  What happened to all the civil libertarians on the left? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=188.78s)]
*  It's down to like Matt Taibbi and Glenn Greenwald and Naomi Wolf. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=190.74s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=194.06s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=195.06s)]
*  I've never seen a category vanish more quickly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=196.06s)]
*  Cash Patel, I appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvKEbzDMuX8&t=198.14s)]
