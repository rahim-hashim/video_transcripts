# Ron DeSantis cautiously optimistic about coordinated, helpful federal response to Ian
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY)
*  Ron DeSantis is of course the governor of Florida. He is watching all this very very intensely. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=0.0s)]
*  He has declared a state of emergency in Florida tonight. He joins us right now. Governor, thank [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=5.2s)]
*  you very much for coming on. You're seeing the bigger picture here. How would you assess [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=12.08s)]
*  Florida right now? Well Tucker, this is a major major storm. I mean it hit at 155 miles an hour. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=16.64s)]
*  That is one tick below a category five. But unlike some of the category five storms we've had, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=24.319999999999997s)]
*  this is a huge storm in terms of its size. It brought record storm surge in Collier, Lee counties [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  and it's continuing to churn throughout the state. And so you know you're going to end up with many [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  more people without power. Obviously in southwest Florida as soon as the storm passes you know we [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=42.8s)]
*  have emergency responders at the local level. The state has marshaled hundreds of aircraft. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=49.44s)]
*  We have high water vehicles. We have the capacity to go by air, by land or by sea to help people [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  and we will do that and that's going to need to need to take place. But then you're going to have [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=63.04s)]
*  a major effort to restore power. We have 100 cell towers that we can help stand up to help do [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=68.16s)]
*  communications. We have over 42,000 linemen and other personnel associated with restoring power. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=75.04s)]
*  If you're driving anywhere in Florida, I-10, I-95, you see these trucks coming into the state [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  and it's been ongoing. So that's going to be the biggest probably logistical effort in the history [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  of the state. As soon as it's safe to go in, they're going to go in, try to get of course rescue [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=92.48s)]
*  people first, then try to stabilize the situation, restore power, get fuel in there and make sure [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=97.76s)]
*  people can communicate. So the storm came ashore in southwest Florida, Lee, Charlotte counties in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=104.0s)]
*  there. It's hard to know exactly what's going on there. You would know how bad does it look, the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=111.2s)]
*  damage, do you think? Well I think it's clearly the biggest flood event we've ever seen in that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=117.6s)]
*  part of the state and that's not just Lee and Charlotte. That would be Collier. You had massive, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=124.08s)]
*  storm surge. You have places in those counties that have massive standing water. That of course [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=129.76s)]
*  presents a lot of hazards on the back end. I mean we've been telling folks be careful once the storm [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=135.76s)]
*  goes past. You know in Hurricane Irma, Tucker, I had the folks pull the numbers. There were seven [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=141.12s)]
*  deaths directly caused by Hurricane Irma. There were 77 deaths caused in the aftermath for things [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=146.8s)]
*  like downed power lines or misusing generators. So that's going to be a major, major disaster. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=153.6s)]
*  In terms of some of the structural damage, I think it's too soon. We're getting some intermittent [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=159.2s)]
*  reports but it's really going to have to pass. We're going to have people out there at the local [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=163.76s)]
*  and state level assessing the damage but my sense is I think it's going to be one of the biggest [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=168.48s)]
*  flood events we've ever had. What remains to be seen is just how much damage the wind did. Obviously [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=173.6s)]
*  it's very significant but as you know Tucker in that part of Florida, you know a lot of those [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=179.92s)]
*  buildings that are built are built specifically to withstand a category five hurricane and so [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  we'll see Florida building codes. How did they hold up and hopefully they held up okay. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=190.48s)]
*  When a natural disaster like this strikes a state, it is common. I think it's always the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  case that the state receives federal aid. Given how politicized things are at the moment, are you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=204.16s)]
*  confident you're going to get the federal support Florida needs? So I actually spoke with the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=209.12s)]
*  president and he said he wants to be helpful. So we did submit a request for reimbursement [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=215.52s)]
*  for the next 60 days at 100 percent. That's significant support but it's a significant [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=221.36s)]
*  storm. So we haven't heard back from it but I'm actually cautiously optimistic that we do. I mean [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=228.16s)]
*  as you say Tucker, we live in a very politicized time but you know when people are fighting for [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=232.88s)]
*  their lives, when their whole livelihood is at stake, when they've lost everything, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=237.36s)]
*  if you can't put politics aside for that then you're just not going to be able to. So I'll [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=242.24s)]
*  work with anybody who wants to help the people of southwest Florida and throughout our state. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=246.56s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihB7RVLhJvY&t=252.0s)]
