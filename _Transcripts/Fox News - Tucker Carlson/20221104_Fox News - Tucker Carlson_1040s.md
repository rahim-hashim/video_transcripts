# Tucker Carlson: This is laughably absurd
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's Unhappy Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  What a day. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=2.92s)]
*  And it started on the weirdest possible note. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=3.96s)]
*  If you tuned into the Today Show this morning, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=6.22s)]
*  looking for the usual funny cat videos [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=8.6s)]
*  and trans-friendly salad recipes, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=10.74s)]
*  you may have been surprised to find actual news [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=13.6s)]
*  being committed on your screen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=15.88s)]
*  In place of the segment you expected to see, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=17.68s)]
*  fit and sexy over 70, there was NBC News correspondent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=19.92s)]
*  Miguel Almaguer letting you know that actually, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=23.84s)]
*  that assault on Paul Pelosi in San Francisco [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=26.96s)]
*  that you read about last week, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=29.0s)]
*  that story was a whole lot stranger than you ever imagined. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=30.4s)]
*  According to Almaguer, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=34.82s)]
*  citing several law enforcement sources [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=35.92s)]
*  with direct knowledge, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=37.6s)]
*  it was Paul Pelosi who opened the door [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=38.92s)]
*  for police when they arrived. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=41.54s)]
*  Now you'll remember that authorities had previously told us [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=43.56s)]
*  that the intruder, David De Pape, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=45.96s)]
*  had broken into Paul Pelosi's bedroom [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  on the third floor of the house and woken him up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Yet somehow both Pelosi and De Pape [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=52.74s)]
*  were on the ground floor by the time police got there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=54.72s)]
*  Moreover, according to Almaguer, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=57.52s)]
*  Pelosi and De Pape had been together in the house [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=59.84s)]
*  for at least half an hour. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=62.06s)]
*  And yet strangely, they both seemed fine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  With police present, Almaguer reported, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=67.10000000000001s)]
*  Paul Pelosi, quote, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=69.72s)]
*  did not immediately declare an emergency or leave his home. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  Instead he, quote, walked back several feet [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=73.92s)]
*  toward the assailant and away from police. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=80.72s)]
*  Paul Pelosi walked away from the police [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=82.0s)]
*  and toward David De Pape? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=84.12s)]
*  What could possibly explain behavior like that? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=86.12s)]
*  And what were the two doing for the 30 minutes [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=89.12s)]
*  before police arrived? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=91.08s)]
*  Under normal circumstances, we wouldn't wanna know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  Paul Pelosi's personal life is his business. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=95.64s)]
*  It's not our business. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  We've got nothing against the guy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=98.76s)]
*  We believe in privacy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=100.28s)]
*  But unfortunately for Paul Pelosi, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=102.28s)]
*  there's an election coming next week [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=104.04s)]
*  and his wife's allies immediately politicized [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  the assault against him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=108.4s)]
*  They tried to tell us that David De Pape, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  a homeless, illegal, alien, nudist drug addict [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=112.4s)]
*  who had a BLM flag hanging near the broken school bus [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=115.88s)]
*  that he lives in, was actually a right-wing hit man [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  inspired by Q, determined to act out the violence [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=122.32s)]
*  of January 6th in Nancy Pelosi's own home. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  They told us that, like we'd believe it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=129.22s)]
*  Then the president of the United States went on television [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=131.42s)]
*  and said it again. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=133.16s)]
*  It's laughably absurd. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=135.06s)]
*  Russia bombed its own pipeline, okay. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=137.4s)]
*  But they said it and they're still saying it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=139.9s)]
*  Then out of nowhere comes the Today Show, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=142.56s)]
*  the head baton twirler [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=145.2s)]
*  in the Democratic Party's media pep squad [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=146.78s)]
*  and completely, probably unintentionally, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  blows up their lie. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=151.28s)]
*  After watching Al McGeer's story [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=154.16s)]
*  in the Today Show this morning, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=155.76s)]
*  you could only conclude, as Elon Musk put it, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  there's a tiny possibility there might be more [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=159.76s)]
*  to the story than meets the eye. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  You think? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  And now we know for a fact that there is more to the story [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=165.88s)]
*  because NBC News has Jeffrey Epstein-ed the entire thing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  NBC deleted Al McGeer's story, both from its website, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=172.2s)]
*  and from Twitter. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=176.12s)]
*  Why'd they do that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=176.96s)]
*  Well, obviously they did it because the report was true. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=177.88s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=180.88s)]
*  When was the last time you saw someone punished for lying? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=182.2s)]
*  No one's ever punished for lying. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=186.12s)]
*  You can lie all you want. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=188.28s)]
*  What you can't do is tell the truth [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=190.12s)]
*  about something important. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=192.0s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=193.88s)]
*  You will be punished if you do that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=195.14s)]
*  And many are punished in case you haven't noticed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=197.12s)]
*  So just for fun, we called over to NBC News today. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=200.96s)]
*  We wanted to get their explanation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=203.04s)]
*  for why they censored their own story. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=204.3s)]
*  But mostly for being honest, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=207.38000000000002s)]
*  we just wanted to rub their noses in the fact [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  that they're not journalists at all. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  They're obedient little throne-sniffing servants [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=212.18s)]
*  to the party in power. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=214.34s)]
*  Predictably, NBC News refused to tell us [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  what was wrong with their own story, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=218.34s)]
*  but of course we already knew what was wrong with it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=219.5s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi didn't like it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=221.06s)]
*  That was the problem. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=222.58s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi did appreciate the story [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=224.06s)]
*  that NBC News ran and titled, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=225.78s)]
*  "'The GOP has Paul Pelosi's blood on its hands.'" [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=227.62s)]
*  That story remains on the NBC website tonight. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=231.78s)]
*  It meets their quote, standards. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=234.74s)]
*  So what are we watching here? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=237.82s)]
*  Well, lying, obviously, but not the usual kind of lying. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=239.22s)]
*  Normal people lie in a very recognizable way. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=243.9s)]
*  They're human beings. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  They have consciences. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=247.26s)]
*  They feel guilty about lying. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=248.1s)]
*  So they don't go all the way. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=249.38s)]
*  They shade the truth. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=250.22s)]
*  Did you eat these cookies, you'll ask your five-year-old? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=252.1s)]
*  I had one, he'll say, looking at you nervously. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=254.7s)]
*  He's lying, but he's doing it to the minimum extent [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=256.98s)]
*  he feels he has to. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=259.82s)]
*  But if you ask a sociopath the same question, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=261.85999999999996s)]
*  you'll get a very different answer. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  Did you eat these cookies, you'll ask? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  No, he'll reply, looking you straight in the face [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  and smiling faintly. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=270.73999999999995s)]
*  You ate them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=272.29999999999995s)]
*  That's not shading the truth. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=274.46s)]
*  That's inverting the truth. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=276.17999999999995s)]
*  It's scary, and you're seeing a lot of it lately. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=278.7s)]
*  John Fetterman won the View Today, for example. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=281.65999999999997s)]
*  The one thing everyone knows about John Fetterman [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  is that in May, he suffered serious brain damage [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=286.11999999999995s)]
*  from a stroke. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=288.17999999999995s)]
*  He can now barely speak. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=289.02s)]
*  That's true, it's obvious. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=290.38s)]
*  There's no debate about it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=291.38s)]
*  Now, if you live in Pennsylvania, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=292.94s)]
*  you may vote for John Fetterman on Tuesday anyway, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=293.94s)]
*  depending upon how attached you are to late-term abortion. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=296.42s)]
*  But no matter how you vote, with or against, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=299.5s)]
*  you can't argue that John Fetterman, quote, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=302.24s)]
*  "'looks and sounds great,' [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  because by any measure, he does not, at all." [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  But that's exactly what ABC hosts argued today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=308.98s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=312.74s)]
*  I think you look and sound great. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=314.98s)]
*  So last week, let me ask you this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=316.94s)]
*  You and Dr. Oz faced off in your first televised debate, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=319.14s)]
*  and you said, quote, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=322.86s)]
*  "'It wasn't exactly easy.' [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=324.0s)]
*  I think it was an incredibly courageous and brave thing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=326.06s)]
*  for you to show what healing from a stroke looks like.'" [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=328.7s)]
*  That's incredibly brave. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=332.3s)]
*  On the other hand, Dr. Oz, a cardiac surgeon, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=333.78s)]
*  in my view, came off as a bully. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  Does any of this surprise you, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=340.78s)]
*  a man with a Harvard master's degree? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  Do you think the people of Pennsylvania [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=345.0s)]
*  saw what they needed to see from you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=346.68s)]
*  to gain their vote? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=348.74s)]
*  Yeah, I really believe that it certainly wasn't an even, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=352.7s)]
*  an even event for me, without a doubt. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=356.22s)]
*  John Fetterman, you look and sound great. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=360.18s)]
*  Really, ABC lady? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=362.7s)]
*  Have you had a stroke too? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=364.32s)]
*  How stupid do you think your audience is? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=366.3s)]
*  Pretty stupid, apparently. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  This same liar described Fetterman's Senate debate [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=370.36s)]
*  performance, the one you saw, as, quote, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=373.3s)]
*  incredibly courageous and brave, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=375.08s)]
*  like he was on the Bin Laden raid [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=377.34s)]
*  instead of drooling on a stage in Harrisburg. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=379.14s)]
*  In case you've forgotten what she was referring to, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  here's what it looked like. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=384.34s)]
*  You're running for a seat that could decide [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=387.26s)]
*  the balance of power in Washington. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=389.82s)]
*  What qualifies you to be a U.S. Senator? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=392.14s)]
*  You have 60 seconds. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=395.23999999999995s)]
*  Hi, good night, everybody. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=397.73999999999995s)]
*  Hi, good night, everybody. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=400.9s)]
*  That's not incredibly courageous. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=403.38s)]
*  It's incredibly cruel. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=405.38s)]
*  John Fetterman's wife ought to be shunned by decent people [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=407.46s)]
*  for allowing that to happen. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=410.38s)]
*  She knew her husband's condition. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=411.74s)]
*  She just wants the power. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=413.42s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  And keep in mind, that's how John Fetterman talks [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=416.78s)]
*  with the help of a computer. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=418.9s)]
*  We got a glimpse of his talking machine today. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=420.52s)]
*  It's the size of an iron lung. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=422.82s)]
*  Fetterman, who's recovering from a stroke in May, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=426.18s)]
*  used a closed captioning device during the interview, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=429.02s)]
*  with the stenographer typing out the questions [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=432.08s)]
*  in real time. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=434.44s)]
*  Again, just like the question of what Paul Pelosi [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=437.56s)]
*  was doing at two in the morning [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=440.56s)]
*  with an illegal alien nudist, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  we would be just as happy, in fact, very happy, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=443.4s)]
*  to ignore this whole thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=445.97999999999996s)]
*  We don't wanna talk about John Fetterman's stroke. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=447.62s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=450.24s)]
*  It's depressing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=451.08s)]
*  John Fetterman should have dropped out of the race in May [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=452.64s)]
*  with the encouragement of his loving wife, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  which apparently he doesn't have. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=456.86s)]
*  But instead, they're pushing him, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=458.56s)]
*  the Democratic Party is pushing him, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=459.76s)]
*  to run for the Senate, despite his inability to speak. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=461.46s)]
*  And they're doing that because they want power. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=464.08s)]
*  And for the rest of us, that means we are now required [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=466.34s)]
*  to pretend that the sad brain damage guy [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=468.5s)]
*  is actually incredibly brave and impressive. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  In other words, they're demanding that we ignore [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=474.02s)]
*  what we can see with our eyes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=475.7s)]
*  That's called the big lie. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=477.88s)]
*  And four days before the midterm elections, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=480.02s)]
*  it's everywhere. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  Here's Joy Reid of MSNBC telling you [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=483.9s)]
*  that inflation is not real. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=486.17999999999995s)]
*  Now, you may think, you may imagine [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=488.74s)]
*  that you're paying more for spaghetti [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=490.42s)]
*  and two by fours and heating oil. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=491.94s)]
*  Oh no, that's just a figment of your imagination. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=493.58000000000004s)]
*  In fact, it's a diabolical Psyop engineered [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=496.26s)]
*  by the information warfare division [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=498.94s)]
*  of the Republican Party in Washington. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=500.74s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=503.5s)]
*  The only people I ever hear use the word inflation [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  are journalists and economists, right? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=507.34000000000003s)]
*  So that is not part of the normal lexicon [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=510.94s)]
*  of the way people talk. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=513.98s)]
*  So it's interesting that Republicans are doing something [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=515.46s)]
*  they don't normally do, right? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=517.62s)]
*  Which is not use the common tongue, right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=518.86s)]
*  Not use just common English to sort of use, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=521.54s)]
*  do on their campaigns like they're doing with crime. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=523.26s)]
*  But what they've done is they've taught people [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=525.46s)]
*  the word inflation, right? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=527.42s)]
*  Most people who would have never used that word ever [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=528.98s)]
*  in their lives are using it now [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=530.86s)]
*  because they've been taught it, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=532.28s)]
*  including on TV, including in newspapers. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=533.9s)]
*  They've been taught this word. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=537.12s)]
*  Someday we're gonna do a recurring segment [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=540.94s)]
*  called guest Joy Reid's IQ. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=542.5s)]
*  That'll be fun. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=544.44s)]
*  What they've done, says the Harvard lady. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=545.78s)]
*  What they've done, if they've taught people [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=547.7s)]
*  the word inflation. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=549.94s)]
*  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=552.46s)]
*  The Republican Party running around teaching people words, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=553.6600000000001s)]
*  even three syllable words, inflation. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=557.38s)]
*  Inflation, scary. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=561.5400000000001s)]
*  Next, some of these MAGA people will be reading [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=564.08s)]
*  and writing their own names on legal documents [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=566.3000000000001s)]
*  and God knows what else. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=568.46s)]
*  Stop them before they bring literacy to the population. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=570.3000000000001s)]
*  Before you know it, people will start to believe [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=573.5400000000001s)]
*  that crime is real. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=574.9200000000001s)]
*  And for the record, it's not. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=576.12s)]
*  But there's a major concern surrounding the racist rhetoric [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=579.04s)]
*  that often goes hand in glove with law and order messages. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=582.76s)]
*  Republicans are pulling out all the old fear [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=586.64s)]
*  and loathing playbook, trying to scare voters about crime. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=589.52s)]
*  They're not concerned about voter safety. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=593.08s)]
*  They just wanna keep voters scared. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=596.64s)]
*  They have now turned to a strategy [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=598.68s)]
*  that sensationalizes crime, that weaponizes crime, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=601.16s)]
*  and that racializes crime. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=604.4s)]
*  The other guys play the crime card relentlessly [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=606.92s)]

*  It's got racial elements to it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=611.04s)]
*  Let's just call that for what it is. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=612.56s)]
*  The type of crime that scares Republican [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  and independent voters the most [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=616.48s)]
*  to make them believe that crime is skyrocketing, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=617.9399999999999s)]
*  that America is a hellhole. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=620.14s)]
*  The thing is, it works. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  Dystopian, nakedly racist video, preferably grainy, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=624.36s)]
*  security cam footage featuring almost exclusively [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  black people committing crime in big cities. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=632.0s)]

*  You know what they're doing? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you know what they're doing? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=639.16s)]
*  These racists, they're weaponizing crime. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=640.92s)]
*  It's not the guy with the weapon who's the problem. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=645.38s)]
*  The one stealing your purse or raping you [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=647.9s)]
*  or breaking into your house or carjacking you [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=650.8399999999999s)]
*  with the kids in the back. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, that's not the weapon [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  that we need to worry about. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=655.88s)]
*  The weapon is you're noticing that it's happening. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=656.8s)]
*  And in case you don't believe that, we have statistics. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=662.16s)]
*  And they appeared the other day in CNN. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=664.98s)]
*  CNN ran a report on FBI crime stats [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=666.74s)]
*  showing that crime is down. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=669.26s)]
*  See, crime is down. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=670.84s)]
*  These are numbers. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=672.74s)]
*  Kind of forgot to mention that the FBI report they cited [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=674.74s)]
*  left out 40% of major cities in the United States, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=677.38s)]
*  including the two biggest, New York and Los Angeles. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=681.28s)]

*  Oh, except for the population centers. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=687.1800000000001s)]
*  But you know, Bangor and Great Falls, totally fine. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=689.58s)]
*  It's totally fine. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=694.14s)]
*  So again, this is not a small lie. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=696.8199999999999s)]
*  Not a small lie, it's a big lie. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=699.22s)]
*  The big lie. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=700.78s)]
*  I think that's a phrase they use. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=701.62s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=703.86s)]
*  They're also denying there's anything wrong [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=705.18s)]
*  with our southern border. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=706.58s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with our southern border. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=707.98s)]
*  There's no invasion. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=709.22s)]
*  Five million people, five million friends come over [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=710.14s)]
*  for dinner, not a big deal. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=712.34s)]
*  And by the way, if you've got video of it, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=714.46s)]
*  it's probably fake. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=715.6999999999999s)]
*  Actually, we do. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=716.74s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=717.62s)]
*  Clearly, this is major news. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=719.66s)]

*  what was Fox News airing? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=728.86s)]
*  Crime, crime, crime. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=730.42s)]
*  Crime, inflation, immigration. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=731.8199999999999s)]
*  That's all they do all day, every day, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=733.8199999999999s)]

*  We saw JD Vance harping on the issue of crime [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=739.54s)]
*  and linking it to things like illegal immigration. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=743.06s)]
*  Those are the types of issues, the things that drive fear. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=746.74s)]
*  They're just coming straight out, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=750.14s)]
*  and especially during election time, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=751.3s)]
*  we see it's the caravans again, it's the fear of immigrants. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=753.02s)]
*  They were scaring suburban white women [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=756.02s)]
*  with caravans coming to their neighborhood. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=758.0999999999999s)]

*  The border crisis, crime on the rise, and inflation. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=765.62s)]
*  Why aren't they talking about climate change? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=770.54s)]

*  Climate change is what matters. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=774.8199999999999s)]
*  Instead, they're talking about their country, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=776.42s)]
*  their stupid country. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=778.26s)]
*  It's just five million people. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=779.9399999999999s)]
*  You're racist if you notice. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=781.8199999999999s)]
*  Again, nothing you just heard refutes in any way the facts [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=784.58s)]
*  that Fox News puts on a loop. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=787.86s)]
*  What it addresses is you, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=791.6999999999999s)]
*  and the person it attacks is you, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=794.46s)]
*  because you dared to notice. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=796.54s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=799.58s)]
*  You're not allowed to notice, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=801.3s)]
*  and don't you dare vote against it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=802.66s)]
*  So of the many lies they're pushing, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=806.1s)]
*  maybe the most bewildering of all [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=808.02s)]
*  is the idea that you can destroy democracy by voting. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=809.94s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=812.98s)]
*  We're under the impression you destroyed democracy [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=814.0200000000001s)]
*  with like, artillery, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=815.74s)]
*  or by changing the population of your country, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=818.58s)]
*  by opening the borders, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=822.0200000000001s)]
*  thereby watering down the voting power of the population. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=823.98s)]
*  It's citizens. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=828.5400000000001s)]
*  That might be destroying democracy. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=829.3800000000001s)]
*  But no. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=830.9000000000001s)]
*  Now we've learned that the real attack on democracy [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=832.1s)]
*  is electoral disobedience. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=836.34s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=838.3800000000001s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=840.2s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot for all of us. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=842.34s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=844.9000000000001s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=846.74s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=848.46s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=849.3800000000001s)]
*  Democracy is actually on the ballot. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=851.5s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=852.98s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=854.82s)]
*  And democracy is on the ballot. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=856.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=857.34s)]
*  Do you believe that democracy is on the ballot in Utah? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=858.4200000000001s)]
*  It is on the ballot. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=862.0600000000001s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot this year in America. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=863.1800000000001s)]
*  Somebody's gotta tell voters what they need to hear, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=865.82s)]
*  which is that democracy is on the ballot. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=867.98s)]
*  All right, and this is ultimately a new show. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  We have our opinions, but it's also incumbent on us [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=872.82s)]
*  to check the facts. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=874.86s)]
*  So we have a sample ballot here and we're checking, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=875.7s)]
*  and it turns out democracy is not on the ballot. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=877.3000000000001s)]
*  There are actually names of candidates who are on the ballot [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=880.5s)]
*  and you get to choose one as a voter, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=882.5s)]
*  the one who best represents you, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=885.5s)]
*  and you get to choose any candidate you want [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=888.0600000000001s)]
*  because it's a democracy, meaning you run the government [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=889.94s)]
*  because it's your country. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=892.54s)]
*  So no, democracy is not on the ballot. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=893.9s)]
*  And of course they knew that. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=896.1s)]
*  What they're really telling you [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=897.0999999999999s)]
*  is that the threat to democracy is voters. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=898.7399999999999s)]
*  Don't you dare destroy this beautiful representative [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=902.02s)]
*  government by asking it to represent you. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=904.3399999999999s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=907.66s)]
*  Democracy means supporting Joe Biden [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=909.7399999999999s)]
*  and anything less than that is insurrection. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=911.6199999999999s)]
*  That's the script they're reading. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=916.2199999999999s)]
*  And the amazing thing is some of the more feeble-minded [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=917.9799999999999s)]
*  among them actually seem to believe it. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=919.9s)]
*  So Michael Beschloss, for example, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  Beschloss is living proof that you don't have to pass [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=923.18s)]
*  an IQ test to become a historian. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=924.9399999999999s)]
*  You just have to call yourself one. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=926.42s)]
*  I'm a historian, Michael Beschloss. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=927.3399999999999s)]
*  So they hauled in Beschloss the other day [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=929.38s)]
*  from semi-retirement to ruminate about democracy. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=931.0999999999999s)]
*  And they expected him to say, democracy's on the ballot. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=934.54s)]
*  And he may have said that, but as he got going, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=938.2199999999999s)]
*  he lost control of himself. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=940.54s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=942.38s)]
*  And a historian 50 years from now, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=944.18s)]
*  if historians are allowed to write in this country, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=947.06s)]
*  and if there are still free publishing houses [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=949.9s)]
*  and a free press, which I'm not certain of, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=952.38s)]
*  but if that is true, a historian will say, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=955.06s)]
*  what was at stake tonight and this week [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=958.3s)]
*  was the fact whether we will be a democracy in the future, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=961.3599999999999s)]
*  whether our children will be arrested [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=964.66s)]
*  and conceivably killed. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=966.5s)]
*  We're on the edge of a brutal authoritarian system, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=968.6199999999999s)]
*  and it could be a week away. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=972.02s)]
*  A week away? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=974.9s)]
*  What? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=976.42s)]
*  We don't know where Michael Beschloss is broadcasting from. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=978.9399999999999s)]
*  It didn't look like a bunker. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=981.9s)]
*  Looked like a French country kitchen [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=983.62s)]
*  that his decorator put together, but whatever. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=985.5s)]
*  Hope he's stockpiling low carb pasta [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=987.7s)]
*  because it could be a dark tomorrow. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=991.66s)]
*  Now keep in mind, this is the guy who was advising [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=995.26s)]
*  Joe Biden on extremism, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=997.42s)]
*  but needless to say, he does not regard himself [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=999.46s)]
*  as an extremist. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1001.1s)]
*  Quote, if you vote Republican, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1002.34s)]
*  your children will be arrested and killed. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1003.78s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1005.94s)]
*  That's his campaign slogan. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1007.9s)]
*  It's not quite as reassuring as say, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1009.0600000000001s)]
*  a chicken in every pot or even hope and change, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1010.98s)]
*  but at this point, Democrats are out of hope [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1015.1800000000001s)]
*  and above all, they fear change. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1017.66s)]
*  They want things to say exactly the way they are. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1020.1s)]
*  Unfortunately for them, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1023.66s)]
*  Blake Masters may soon bring change to Washington. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1024.54s)]
*  We hope he does. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1027.18s)]
*  He's running for Senate from the state of Arizona. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1028.26s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1030.3s)]
*  to catch our nightly opens, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1032.6200000000001s)]
*  stories that are changing the world and changing your life [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1034.66s)]
*  from Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHz83GX1H0Q&t=1038.38s)]
