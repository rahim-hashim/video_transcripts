# Tunnel to Towers provides homes for families of fallen soldiers
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8)
*  There are so many groups out there that purport to be helping veterans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=0.0s)]
*  The impulse is honorable. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=5.84s)]
*  It's great. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=6.84s)]
*  Of course, not all the groups are great, however. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=7.84s)]
*  So we wanted to highlight the work of a group we think is great and a man who's devoted [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=9.96s)]
*  his life to helping members of the military and their families. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=13.72s)]
*  Frank Siller is the founder of Tunnels to Towers Foundation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=16.84s)]
*  The organization provides mortgage-free homes for the families of combat veterans who died [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=20.14s)]
*  fighting for the country, as well as veterans who are seriously injured. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=25.3s)]
*  We're happy to have Frank Siller join us tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=27.88s)]
*  Frank, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=29.48s)]
*  So this is totally taking over your time in your life. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  This is what you're doing with your life. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=34.6s)]
*  Tell us why you've decided to do this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=35.6s)]
*  And thank you, by the way. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=37.64s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=38.64s)]
*  Listen, my whole family decided to do this because 20 years ago, our youngest brother, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=40.32s)]
*  a firefighter, Steven Gerard Siller, gave up his life. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=46.0s)]
*  He ran through the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel with 60 pounds of fire gear on his back to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=50.34s)]
*  get to the towers, going up the stairs, saving other people. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=55.6s)]
*  And while doing so, he gave up his life. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=60.04s)]
*  And we made a promise as a family to make sure we never forgot. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=61.04s)]
*  And since that day, we've lost 7,070 men and women in uniform who have been protecting [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=64.48s)]
*  us here on our homeland. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=72.16s)]
*  And we better never forget those great heroes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=74.52s)]
*  And today, we're so proud that we read all of those names, 7,070, at the Lincoln Memorial. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  These Gold Star families were with us reading their loved ones' names out. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=83.7s)]
*  And it was very, very moving and very necessary. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=87.3s)]
*  It was the right thing to do. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=90.18s)]
*  So we're very proud. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=91.72s)]
*  7,070. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=92.72s)]
*  I don't think most Americans understand the magnitude of that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=93.72s)]
*  So part of what you do is give homes to the families of servicemen killed in action. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=98.3s)]
*  What is the response to that? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=107.76s)]
*  I mean, that's such a remarkable thing to do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=108.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=110.72s)]
*  We gave out 35 mortgage-free homes today to Gold Star families. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=111.72s)]
*  We gave out 85. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=116.44s)]
*  This year alone, we're doing 200. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=117.6s)]
*  Now, you could do the math, Tucker. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=119.24s)]
*  That's a big number. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=121.24s)]
*  But we have Fox viewers have been helping us for years, thank goodness. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=122.24s)]
*  And we've been able to accomplish this because of the generosity of great Americans. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=127.2s)]
*  Look, it's something, the reaction is, thank God, they thank us because they could stay [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=132.28s)]
*  in their homes, that they were making the dreams with their loved ones. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=137.56s)]
*  And if they didn't have a home, because a lot of these servicemembers go from base to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=141.36s)]
*  base and don't have one, we build them a mortgage-free home. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=145.16s)]
*  So they're so grateful because everyone we do for has a young family left behind. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=147.84s)]
*  And I think the least that we could do is a country to take care of these families that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=153.04s)]
*  put it all on the line for us. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  And so many times they don't come home. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=159.12s)]
*  They're willing to die for you and I every day, Tucker. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=160.92s)]
*  And so many times they do. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  And we better take care of them as a nation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=165.04s)]
*  And at Total Towers Foundation, we just want to be that conduit to bring Americans together [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=167.1s)]
*  to take care of these families. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  I agree with that completely. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=173.04s)]
*  Final question I have to ask, does it wear you out emotionally? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=174.32s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=178.76s)]
*  It is so uplifting, so gratifying. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=179.76s)]
*  And I love these families. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=182.28s)]
*  They love our foundation. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  We bring them into our, we just love them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=184.68s)]
*  If you're with us, you would see what's happening. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  All these families that get these mortgage-free homes, they join us on the mission. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=191.56s)]
*  They want to help the next family. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=194.84s)]
*  They want to pay it forward. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=196.84s)]
*  So it is quite remarkable. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=198.32s)]
*  It is something that is divine intervention. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=200.68s)]
*  But we can't do it without the generosity of Americans. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=204.28s)]
*  We know we are the land of the free because of the brave, but we better take care of the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=207.28s)]
*  brave when they don't come home. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=211.08s)]
*  At least take care of the families that are left behind. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=212.68s)]
*  And that is our promise forever. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=215.78s)]
*  The Total Towers Foundation has made that commitment. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=217.68s)]
*  We ask an awful lot of these people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=220.62s)]
*  I agree with you completely. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  Frank Siller, thank you very much. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzepLyw-VP8&t=223.20000000000002s)]
