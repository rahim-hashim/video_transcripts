# Chamath Palihapitiya claims 'nobody cares' about Chinese Uyghurs
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo)
*  Welcome back. Chamath Palya Pitya is a billionaire out in California in Silicon Valley. He's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=0.0s)]
*  a huge donor to the Democratic Party. He's also the part owner of the NBA team, the Golden [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=8.1s)]
*  State Warriors. So on a recent podcast, he went out and told the truth. And he said what [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=12.5s)]
*  he personally thinks about China's human rights abuses, its genocide, its murder of the ethnic [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=17.62s)]
*  minority, the Uighurs. Watch this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, nobody cares about what's happening to the Uighurs, okay? You bring it up because [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=27.099999999999998s)]
*  you really care. And I think that's nice that you care. The rest of us don't care. I'm just [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=30.5s)]
*  telling you a very hard, I'm telling you a very hard ugly truth, okay? Of all the things [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=34.739999999999995s)]
*  that I care about, yes, it is below my line. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=40.58s)]
*  Repulsive human being, obviously. You got to kind of admire his honesty. Can't be honest. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=45.42s)]
*  We're glad he was. So the Golden State Warriors issued a statement that read this way, Mr. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=52.86s)]
*  Palya Pitya does not speak on behalf of our franchise. And of course, the billionaire [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  himself issued a statement saying, well, my family came from a country with mean people. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=60.5s)]
*  And by the way, the United States has human rights abuses too. Even more repulsive than [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=64.3s)]
*  you would ever imagine. Of course, the Golden State Warriors didn't even mention the Uighurs [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=70.02s)]
*  in their statement. You wouldn't want to upset China. Say the word Taiwan. We dare you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=73.42s)]
*  Enos Cantor Freedom knows a lot about how this all works. He plays for the Boston Celtics. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=78.9s)]
*  He recently became an American citizen. He's very proud of that. Second time he's joined [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=83.34s)]
*  us and we're glad he's here. Mr. Freedom, thank you very much for coming on tonight. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=86.94s)]
*  So to hear someone say it, oh, I like your shirt. To see someone say that as clearly [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=91.62s)]
*  as this owner just did, like, I don't care if they're murdered by the government of China. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=96.94s)]
*  How do you feel when you see that? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  I remember we had a game today at 1230 and my manager texted me this video right before [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=104.9s)]
*  the game. And first of all, I couldn't believe it. I was very angry, very disgusted and very [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=109.62s)]
*  disappointed. And his comments were so, I was like, I couldn't focus on the game because [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=115.66s)]
*  of his comments. I mean, you look at the Uighur people, what's happened to the Uighurs is [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  one of the worst human rights abuses in the world today and there is a genocide happening [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=128.78s)]
*  while we're talking right now. And him going out there and saying, I could care less, it's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=133.02s)]
*  a shame and it is disgusting. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=137.34s)]
*  I mean, so you just became an American citizen. To see the most privileged, the richest people [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=140.34s)]
*  in our society, some of them anyway, just say out loud, like, I don't care about anybody [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  but myself making money, having power over this country. I mean, that must be kind of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  discouraging as someone who just got here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  You know, the funny thing is this guy owns a company called, actually I have it right [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=156.86s)]
*  here, called Social Capital where they pretend to care about social values and this is a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=162.18s)]
*  virtue signal and I have all these recordings here with me. He pretends to care about the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=167.9s)]
*  others but the only thing he cares about is money and promoting the CCP propaganda. And [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=173.1s)]
*  it makes me sick how he's using social justice to make money for his company. And I want [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=179.1s)]
*  to ask him one question. You know, one question. If your mother, if your daughter, if your [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=184.78s)]
*  sister was in those concentration camps and getting tortured and gang rape every day, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  would you still think about money? Would you still remain silent? So I want him to answer [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=194.74s)]
*  that question. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=199.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, greed is a sin. People used to say that out loud. No one ever says that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=200.34s)]
*  out loud now but you obviously understand it. And I'm so glad you said that and I'm [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=204.88s)]
*  so glad you're in this country. Thank you very much, Mr. Freedom. Good to see you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZ5k1u9PKo&t=210.04s)]
