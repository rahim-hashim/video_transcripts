# Heather Mac Donald: The post-George Floyd horrors never stop coming
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U)
*  Heather McDonald knows a lot about this topic. She's written about policing for many years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=0.0s)]
*  She's the author of an upcoming book called When Race Trumps Merit. She joins us [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=4.64s)]
*  tonight to assess. Heather McDonald, thank you so much for coming on. This is the tragedy, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=8.08s)]
*  this is one of them, that you predicted, I think. How would you assess what we saw in Memphis? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=12.48s)]
*  Well, this makes me long for the days, Tucker, when we heard ad nauseam from academia that blacks [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=19.68s)]
*  cannot be racist because racism equals power plus privilege and blacks, by definition, have neither [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=24.0s)]
*  of them. Now we're at the point where racism is a virtually non-falsifiable proposition. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=29.76s)]
*  My favorite example of this new paradigm is the claim that the fact that the five officers in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=35.6s)]
*  Memphis were indicted for murder is itself a product of racism. So, you know, what's an ally [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=40.56s)]
*  to do? The only thing you can do is absolve favored victim groups of all accountability. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=46.24s)]
*  But the larger point is that the post-George Floyd horrors never stop coming. We lost [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=51.2s)]
*  thousands more black lives to drive-by shootings, not a single one of those protested by Black Lives [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=57.68s)]
*  Matter activists, and police departments are now facing a retention and recruitment crisis. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=64.4s)]
*  At the same time that the pressure is escalating yet again to hire by race, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=70.32s)]
*  pressure that began under the Obama administration and even was more longstanding, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=76.16s)]
*  well, letting race trump merit is always a disaster, whether it's in policing or in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=80.72s)]
*  medical training. And the premise for this diversity hiring is not even true. It is not [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=86.32s)]
*  the case that the more black officers you have on a force, the less excessive force of brutality you [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=93.44s)]
*  have. The Obama administration itself found that in Philadelphia, black and Hispanic officers were [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=100.0s)]
*  more likely to shoot unarmed blacks than white officers. A 2017 study found that the more black [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  officers on a force, the more black civilians were killed. So this whole story, the narrative [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=112.64s)]
*  of police racism and the narrative that getting rid of standards will solve our crime or policing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=119.44s)]
*  problems is completely false and it's going to get worse. Yeah, I mean none of this has anything [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=126.56s)]
*  to do with racial justice. These are the enemies of civilization of many colors. It's not about race, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=132.72s)]
*  it's about destroying civilization and they're working on it. Heather McDonald, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=138.56s)]
*  a voice of honesty, I appreciate it. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=142.48s)]
*  nightly opens, stories that are changing the world and changing your life. From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Noe1Iw_k5U&t=147.92000000000002s)]
