# Dr. Oz rips John Fetterman over debate question
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM)
*  I'm at Oz is running against John Federman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=0.0s)]
*  Dr. Oz joins us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=2.7s)]
*  Doctor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=4.32s)]
*  This is one of those races that I'm not sure [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=7.0s)]
*  people are paying attention to, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=8.84s)]
*  but the deeper you look into this guy, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=9.96s)]
*  the more shocking it is that he's running for public office. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=12.24s)]
*  How is this happening, do you think? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=16.26s)]
*  Well, let me just give you a few examples [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=20.04s)]
*  and I'll give you my diagnosis. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=21.72s)]
*  He puts himself above others and the law. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=23.56s)]
*  He does it continuously. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=26.0s)]
*  It's what he's done throughout his career. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=27.3s)]
*  For example, he's backed massive middle class tax hikes, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=29.56s)]
*  but these tax hikes don't affect him [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=33.08s)]
*  because he's not paid his taxes 67 times. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=34.64s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  You want middle class tax hikes, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=39.4s)]
*  but you're not paying your own 67 times. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=40.92s)]
*  He carries a- [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=43.2s)]
*  I'm sorry, let me just stop you there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=44.28s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=46.06s)]
*  So this is a guy who was supported by his parents [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=46.9s)]
*  until he was 49 years old. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=49.16s)]
*  He's a rich kid. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  49 years old, he's taking money from his parents [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=51.32s)]
*  and he hasn't paid his taxes? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=53.36s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=55.18s)]
*  How is that allowed? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=56.04s)]
*  It's stunning to me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=57.32s)]
*  He had a nonprofit and he also has some properties he owns, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  but he's got tax liens. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=62.48s)]
*  He ignores them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=63.72s)]
*  He said they fell through the cracks, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=64.56s)]
*  but it gets worse than this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=66.82s)]
*  The hypocrisy runs deep. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=68.36s)]
*  He cares about criminals over the innocent, it seems. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=69.92s)]
*  One third of all prisoners in Pennsylvania, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=73.3s)]
*  he says, should be released. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=75.24s)]
*  He's argued to release convicted murderers [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=76.48s)]
*  serving life sentences over the objections of the families [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=78.88s)]
*  and others on the parole board. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=82.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Philadelphia murder rate [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=84.4s)]
*  has ever been. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  Debates that we've been talking about are important [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=88.78s)]
*  because he's got to be able to defend [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=91.34s)]
*  his radical left positions, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=92.86s)]
*  but he's been dodging them since July. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  And the Washington Post just put out an op-ed piece [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=95.86s)]
*  saying, I think what everyone should be arguing, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=98.78s)]
*  which is for democracy to survive, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=100.6s)]
*  you've got to have debates. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=102.1s)]
*  You've got to answer questions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  And so he's got to agree, they argue, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  for multiple debates starting immediately [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  to prove his ability to serve. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=109.22s)]
*  And here's what I think is happening to the diagnosis. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=111.42s)]
*  I think liberals are trying to bury the truth. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=113.82s)]
*  They have poured money into Pennsylvania [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=116.86s)]
*  manufacturing a candidate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=118.2s)]
*  And if you're worried about that, go to draz.com [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=119.4s)]
*  and help me out because what they're trying to do [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  is hide what's really going on, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  to manufacture somebody that seems appealing, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  but way outside the boundaries [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=129.52s)]
*  of the values of Pennsylvania. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=131.36s)]
*  And is cognitively impaired. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=133.1s)]
*  I mean, I'm not being mean, but it's not, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=134.46s)]
*  I'm not mocking the guy for having a stroke, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=136.36s)]
*  but we're all gonna have to live under him [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=138.28s)]
*  if he makes it to the Senate. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  We know what happens when you elect someone [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  who's cognitively impaired. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=143.56s)]
*  We're living under it now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=144.52s)]
*  This guy, am I understanding this correctly? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=146.12s)]
*  He wants to boot the debate until after [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=148.12s)]
*  all the early voting has basically been conducted. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=150.8s)]
*  Is that his plan? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=153.4s)]
*  He has not agreed to a debate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=156.28s)]
*  I just want to, a debate agreement means [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=158.12s)]
*  you have a date, a time, a location, a moderator. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=159.96s)]
*  That's not what's happening here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=163.44s)]
*  He has not agreed to a debate. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=165.0s)]
*  And here's what I've been challenging him on. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm saying, listen, either you're healthy enough [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=168.26000000000002s)]
*  to debate, because your team keeps saying you're healthy, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  and you want to hide these radical ideas [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=172.7s)]
*  you've been throwing out there on Twitter, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=175.26s)]
*  which you can't do, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=176.94s)]
*  Or you're lying about your health. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  Either way, we need to know the truth, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  but there's no way for voters in Pennsylvania [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=181.64s)]
*  to understand what this man stands for, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=184.54s)]
*  because he's not been able to defend these positions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=186.54s)]
*  By the way, I can keep going. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  He wants open borders and to legalize all drugs. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=189.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, we've got the biggest open air drug market ever [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=193.44s)]
*  in Philadelphia, swaths of the city consumed by zombies [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=196.72s)]
*  with needles hanging out of their bodies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=200.14s)]
*  The highest fentanyl death rates ever in Philadelphia. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=201.78s)]
*  And Pennsylvania is number three in the country [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=204.06s)]
*  for fentanyl deaths. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  People are crying to me wherever I go. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=206.98000000000002s)]
*  And speaking of going, I campaign a lot. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=208.74s)]
*  I've been to 200 places around Pennsylvania [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  over the summer. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=213.12s)]
*  John Feteman, to my knowledge, maybe half a dozen, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=213.96s)]
*  spoken for a total of 25 minutes or so. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=216.86s)]
*  I mean, he just hasn't answered questions from the media, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  from the voters, or from me. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=221.74s)]
*  So it's not just a debate. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=223.3s)]
*  He's got to get out and start defending himself, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  and he's not doing it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=226.58s)]
*  He's hiding. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  Another decadent rich kid pushing crime and drugs [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=229.2s)]
*  and refusing to defend his position. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=232.04s)]
*  This is not democracy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  And I appreciate your calling it out. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Oz, thank you very much for joining us tonight. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJF4sBhN3qM&t=236.48s)]
