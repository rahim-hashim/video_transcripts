**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378)
*  Lee Zeldin is a member of Congress from New York Eastern, Long Island. He's running for governor of the state against the unelected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=0.0s)]
*  Incumbent now last night a man called David Jacob bonus attempted to stab Zeldin during a campaign event [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=6.26s)]
*  He charged the stage with a blade. Here's footage of the attack [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=13.0s)]
*  There's only one option [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=16.08s)]
*  So how did this guy know where Zeldin was well days before the attack Kathy Hokel once again [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=28.08s)]
*  Who was the governor but has not been elected governor sent out an email listing Zeldin's upcoming campaign appearances and telling her supporters [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=35.28s)]
*  He's an [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=42.2s)]
*  Extremist now if Lee Zeldin's an extremist then we're all in trouble [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=43.84s)]
*  She also tweeted that Zeldin is quote dangerous for New York not just wrong, but dangerous. What a nutcase [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=47.6s)]
*  She is that's the lady with the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=53.160000000000004s)]
*  vaccinated necklace [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  After the attack Lee Zeldin predicted that the man who tried to stab him would get out of jail quickly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  Thanks to New York's bail laws and that is of course exactly what happened [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=62.2s)]
*  The attacker was released from jail with no bail of any kind [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=66.0s)]
*  Now you just saw on the tape that he was tackled and Joe Cheneley is the man who did it [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=69.52s)]
*  He's executive director of American veterans. He joins us tonight [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=74.08s)]
*  So thanks so much for coming on and bless you for what you did. You didn't hesitate at all [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Tell us the circumstance. How did you you seem to have keyed in on this guy right away? How? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=82.76s)]
*  Yes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  So thanks for having me on Tucker. And so I was the master of ceremonies of the rally last night [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=90.0s)]
*  I'm also running for New York State Assembly in that area in Fairport [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=95.36s)]
*  and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=98.68s)]
*  About about five minutes before the incident [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  I noticed a gentleman walking into the rally kind of staggering and it just he didn't seem right [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  It was really high-energy a very positive atmosphere [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=109.56s)]
*  Large crowd and when he came in just didn't seem to have the same vibe and I took notice of that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  Standing just off stage saw him walk up to the edge of the side of the stage where several other people were he stood there [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=120.04s)]
*  I was watching I continued to watch him a little bit as I was continuing to watch the congressman as well [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=125.88s)]
*  And then he jumped up onto the stage. I couldn't get to where he was at that time [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=130.72s)]
*  so I ran around behind the stage came up behind the congressman as I [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=135.64s)]
*  Didn't know exactly what this guy's intentions were as he walked up [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=140.96s)]
*  I watched him and he walked directly up to the congressman as your viewers just saw [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=145.0s)]
*  Told the congressman that you're done and then he pulled a weapon that was attached to his hand and he swung at [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=151.6s)]
*  Congressman Zeldin's face or his throat area congressman [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=159.44s)]
*  Zeldin was able to block that strike or attempted strike and hold his wrist [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=162.52s)]
*  As he pulled his wrist back to try to swing again [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=168.0s)]
*  I grabbed him from behind was able to bear hug him and slam him down to the ground where we were able to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  eventually get his weapon away from him and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=175.96s)]
*  Restraint him until law enforcement came [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=178.44s)]
*  Amazing have you ever been a cop? How do you how do you have such high situational awareness? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBIoU4QF378&t=181.07999999999998s)]
