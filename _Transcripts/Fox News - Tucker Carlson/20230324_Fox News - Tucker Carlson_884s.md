# Tucker: This is infuriating
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Friday. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=3.6s)]
*  It has been a long week in the news business. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=4.44s)]
*  All sorts of things you thought could never happen [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=7.0s)]
*  did in fact happen and then vice versa. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=9.8s)]
*  A whole lot of predictions failed to materialize. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  The big theme of the week as usual was lying. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=15.58s)]
*  There was an extraordinary amount of lying. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=18.6s)]
*  At this point, the people in charge seem [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  like they tell the truth only by accident. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=22.92s)]
*  Occasionally somebody in power will say something true [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=25.0s)]
*  and is swiftly punished for it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=27.8s)]
*  Can't have that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=29.74s)]
*  It's infuriating to watch, but it's also, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=31.46s)]
*  if you look at it right, very amusing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=33.62s)]
*  These are not sophisticated deceptions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=36.36s)]
*  This is not Dwight Eisenhower stealthily planning D-Day. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=38.46s)]
*  This is your five-year-old ambling in with frosting [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=42.08s)]
*  on his face to tell you he never touched the birthday cake. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=44.58s)]
*  Should that make you mad? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=47.54s)]
*  Of course it should make you mad. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=48.36s)]
*  But if you're human, you will also laugh at it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=49.84s)]
*  Cake? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=51.78s)]
*  What cake? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=53.8s)]
*  The kid has no idea how ridiculous he is. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=54.64s)]
*  So with that spirit in mind, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=57.94s)]
*  we're gonna devote the next hour [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=59.82s)]
*  to a special presentation on lying in American politics. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=61.3s)]
*  And we're gonna do our best to stay amused [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=65.17999999999999s)]
*  because that's much better than being angry. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=66.98s)]
*  And we're gonna start with what could be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=69.46s)]
*  the funniest lie of the year. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=71.38s)]
*  Vladimir Putin blew up Russia's natural gas pipeline [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=73.58s)]
*  to Europe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=77.08s)]
*  Now, why would Putin do something like that? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=78.4s)]
*  Well, they told us because he's evil. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=80.86s)]
*  Putin is so evil that he murdered his own country's economy [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=83.38s)]
*  purely for the dark thrill of doing it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=86.34s)]
*  That's evil. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=88.78s)]
*  It takes a bad man to declare war against himself. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  Next, Putin will be invading Moscow. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  So that was their story, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=96.9s)]
*  the story that Biden administration told us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=97.98s)]
*  And then every single news organization in the country, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  with no exceptions at all, backed up the lie. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=102.94s)]
*  Of course Putin did it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  They lectured us. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=106.9s)]
*  Don't ask questions or you're a Russian agent. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  There was for a moment a perfectly united front of falsehood [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=110.88s)]
*  on the question of what happened to Nord Stream. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=114.82s)]
*  But it wasn't enough. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=117.52s)]
*  The story was too absurd to stand [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=119.0s)]
*  even by the standards of 2023. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=121.22s)]
*  Anyone who thought about it for even a moment [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=123.66s)]
*  realized that of course Vladimir Putin [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=125.38s)]
*  didn't blow up his own pipeline. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=126.94s)]
*  Why would he do that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  The Biden administration [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=129.92s)]
*  blew up Vladimir Putin's pipeline. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=131.54s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=133.9s)]
*  Joe Biden himself had promised on camera [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=135.1s)]
*  that he would do it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=136.94s)]
*  And then Biden officials publicly celebrated [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  after it happened. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=140.34s)]
*  So every rational person knew the truth. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=141.18s)]
*  So after a few months, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=145.14s)]
*  the people who lie for a living [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=146.42s)]
*  decided to make up a news story. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=147.7s)]
*  Unfortunately, this one was even dumber and less believable. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=149.22s)]
*  Okay, they conceded Putin didn't do it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=152.64s)]
*  That was wrong. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  We'll admit it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=155.92s)]
*  It was not Putin who blew up the pipeline. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=157.18s)]
*  It was the Ukrainians. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=159.54s)]
*  But not the Ukrainians you're familiar with, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  the ones who are getting billions of American tax dollars [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=163.76s)]
*  every month. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=166.14s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=166.98s)]
*  Not our Ukrainian friends. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=167.82s)]
*  They would never do that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=168.64s)]
*  It was Ukrainians we've never met. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=170.54s)]
*  It was rogue Ukrainians acting against Russia, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=172.54s)]
*  but with no connection to the Biden administration whatsoever. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=176.1s)]
*  These are good people fighting for a noble cause, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=179.22s)]
*  but doing it entirely on their own [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=181.82s)]
*  without our assistance or knowledge. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  That's what the New York Times told us actually happened. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=186.54s)]
*  And then everybody swallowed it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=189.72s)]
*  Watch CNN. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=191.29999999999998s)]
*  In a separate but parallel story, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=192.45999999999998s)]
*  we've been learning more, Kate, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=194.06s)]
*  about the Nord Stream attack. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=195.26s)]
*  You remember the Nord Stream pipeline back in September [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=196.78s)]
*  saw an explosion, a sabotage effort. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=199.84s)]
*  It is the subject of an ongoing investigation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=203.52s)]
*  by German authorities. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=205.6s)]
*  According to New York Times report, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=207.0s)]
*  they say that they believe that according to sources, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=208.4s)]
*  it may have been perpetrated by a group [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=211.24s)]
*  aligned with the aims of Kiev, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=213.16s)]
*  but not actually backed by Kiev, not run by Kiev, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=215.44s)]
*  an independent group acting on its behalf and in its name. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=219.18s)]
*  Totally independent. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=224.12s)]
*  Now imagine if you found yourself repeating something [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=226.52s)]
*  that ridiculous on television. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=229.62s)]
*  Here you have an explosion, a three-part explosion [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=231.46s)]
*  that was part of a deep sea operation in the Baltic Sea, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=236.58s)]
*  300 feet underwater, that happened at exactly the moment [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=240.34s)]
*  that NATO war games were going on in the area. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=244.46s)]
*  So you would think that there was probably some involvement [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=246.5s)]
*  from a military somewhere. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=249.06s)]
*  But no, says the lady on the TV, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=250.3s)]
*  repeating the New York Times, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=253.02s)]
*  it was a shadowy, unnamed group [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=254.82s)]
*  of totally independent Ukrainians [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=256.94s)]
*  who happen to live in a country [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=259.38s)]
*  that the Biden administration runs [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=261.32s)]
*  and whose pensions are being paid for by you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=262.98s)]
*  Right, totally independent. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=267.18s)]
*  Does anyone really believe that? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=270.26s)]
*  Does a single human being, including the hair hats, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=271.58s)]
*  repeating it, actually believe that? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=274.42s)]
*  No. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=277.06s)]
*  And that's the thing about so many of these lies. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  You don't believe them, but you're not special. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=280.44s)]
*  Nobody believes them, even the people repeating them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=282.9s)]
*  And nowhere is that more true [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=288.0s)]
*  than on the question of the climate emergency. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=289.92s)]
*  Here's the climate emergency. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=293.8s)]
*  That's what climate change is about. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=295.52s)]
*  It is literally not figuratively a clear and present danger. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=298.0s)]
*  The latest climate report, nothing less than, quote, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=301.84s)]
*  code red for humanity. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=304.88s)]
*  Let me say it again, code red for humanity. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=307.4s)]
*  Okay, so you can buy that or not. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=310.84s)]
*  And by the way, a lot of good people, some smart people, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=312.68s)]
*  people of good faith do believe that, and that's okay. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=316.18s)]
*  But do the people telling you that believe it? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  Does Joe Biden actually think [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=323.1s)]
*  that climate change is code red for humanity? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, don't listen to what he says, watch what he does. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=329.46000000000004s)]
*  This week, Biden spoke to Canada's Prime Minister, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=331.82000000000005s)]
*  Justin Trudeau, about how terrifying [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  this climate emergency is. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=337.98s)]
*  But he didn't talk to Trudeau on Zoom, no. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  Instead, he flew on a private airplane [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  to the capital of Canada, Ottawa, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=345.7s)]
*  where he and Justin Trudeau drove around the city [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=348.86s)]
*  in a 20-vehicle convoy, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=351.34s)]
*  complete with ambulances and armored vehicles. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=353.86s)]
*  Now, if you were concerned about climate change [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=357.3s)]
*  being driven by humans and the burning of fossil fuels, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=360.74s)]
*  which produce carbon dioxide, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=364.58s)]
*  you probably wouldn't behave like that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=367.18s)]
*  You'd probably just get on the phone [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=368.98s)]
*  and talk about climate change. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  But they didn't. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=371.82s)]
*  And none of the global warming experts [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=373.62s)]
*  who were telling you that your suburban is a sin [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=375.74s)]
*  said a word about it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  In fact, they were busy lecturing you about the rest. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  Your wood stove, your gas stove. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=382.82000000000005s)]
*  You remember in January, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=385.3s)]
*  the gas stove ban was a conspiracy theory. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=386.26000000000005s)]
*  Anyone who was worried about the government cracking down [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=389.06s)]
*  on their kitchen was a nutcase, a Ruby Ridge-level wacko. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=391.58000000000004s)]
*  The New Republic reported back then, and we're quoting, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=397.66s)]
*  people are getting real heated over a gas stove ban [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=399.86s)]
*  that isn't happening. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=402.9s)]
*  Note and appreciate the pun. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  So that's always the first move. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=406.54s)]
*  You're imagining it, crazy person. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=407.9s)]
*  Then we move forward a couple of months [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=411.18s)]
*  and the conspiracy theory is actually, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=413.18s)]
*  well, it's true, and if you disagree with it, you're a wacko. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=416.21999999999997s)]
*  This is from Politico, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=419.74s)]
*  a political blog in Arlington, Virginia yesterday. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=421.38s)]
*  Quote, New York nears deal to ban gas stoves in new homes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=423.86s)]
*  Oh, it's so great. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=428.41999999999996s)]
*  So they say something, if you take it seriously, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=431.94s)]
*  it's your fault because it's not true, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=434.41999999999996s)]
*  and then they tell you that in fact it is true, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=437.7s)]
*  and if you don't agree with it, you're a criminal. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=439.65999999999997s)]
*  You see this a lot. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  You're told something, you're required to believe something [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=443.82s)]
*  that's clearly false, and if you don't go along with it, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=446.14s)]
*  you're banned from social media and harassed, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=448.97999999999996s)]
*  and maybe you can't use Airbnb, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=451.5s)]
*  and maybe if you keep talking, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=453.05999999999995s)]
*  JP Morgan cancels your bank account, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  and then once you submit, they admit, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  actually, yeah, you're right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=459.61999999999995s)]
*  Now, you've seen this on a lot of different topics, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=462.94s)]
*  but you never saw it more clearly at a more sustained pace [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=466.38s)]
*  than over the three years of COVID. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=470.73999999999995s)]
*  Remember they told you, of course you remember, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=473.41999999999996s)]
*  because they told you every day, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=474.94s)]
*  this was a pandemic of the unvaccinated. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=475.85999999999996s)]
*  It is, as we've said, a pandemic [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=478.14s)]
*  and an outbreak of the unvaccinated. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=480.9s)]
*  This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=483.62s)]
*  As Dr. Walensky said on an earlier briefing today, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=487.14s)]
*  this is really becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=491.5s)]
*  Still a long way to go. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=494.46s)]
*  The fact is this has been a pandemic of the unvaccinated. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=496.46s)]
*  Yeah, so we're going to use this global pandemic, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=501.5s)]
*  which was a legitimate health threat, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=504.26s)]
*  to push our political goals into vilify and isolate [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=506.7s)]
*  and punish with law enforcement people [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=512.02s)]
*  who didn't vote for us. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=514.54s)]
*  If you're trying to convince people to fear doctors [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=515.46s)]
*  and never go to the doctor again, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=518.66s)]
*  this is exactly what you would do. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=521.06s)]
*  And of course, that's the effect for millions of people. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=522.74s)]
*  Faith in our medical system has evaporated [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=525.34s)]
*  because of their lying. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=527.5s)]
*  And of course we know they're lying [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=529.02s)]
*  because the vaccinated started getting COVID [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=529.9s)]
*  at a higher rate than people who exercised and ate well [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=531.66s)]
*  and maybe developed natural immunity. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=535.22s)]
*  So in the face of that undeniable science, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=536.9s)]
*  they had to change their talking points. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=539.74s)]
*  But for some reason, nobody told Senator Tina Smith [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=541.9s)]
*  of Minnesota to update her talking points. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=543.9799999999999s)]
*  So here she was on Tuesday of this week, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  assuring everyone in the words of the advertisements, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=549.4599999999999s)]
*  this medicine is safe and effective. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=553.14s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Menzel for being with us today. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=555.38s)]
*  So I want to start by just saying [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=558.8599999999999s)]
*  that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=560.5s)]
*  I mean, how is that different from the niacin creed? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=565.38s)]
*  You just repeat it every week. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=569.66s)]
*  You don't think about what it means. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=571.3399999999999s)]
*  You just repeat the slogans. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=573.4599999999999s)]
*  It's literally a liturgy, safe and effective, really. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=575.02s)]
*  A shot that gives young people heart inflammation [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=580.18s)]
*  without protecting them from COVID, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=583.5s)]
*  that's safe and effective? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=584.8199999999999s)]
*  All this does, all this level of lying does [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=588.3399999999999s)]
*  is make people cynical, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=591.2199999999999s)]
*  not simply about the people in charge. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=593.06s)]
*  You have every reason to be cynical about them, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=594.98s)]
*  but about words themselves. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=596.26s)]
*  Is there a connection between a word [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=597.5s)]
*  and a physical observable reality? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=600.26s)]
*  Oh, I'm not sure anymore. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=601.5s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre at the White House [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=603.62s)]
*  has never even thought about that or much. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=605.7800000000001s)]
*  Here she is confronted with the evidence [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=609.38s)]
*  that the Biden family took a seven figure payout from China. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=611.0600000000001s)]
*  Watch carefully, maybe for the first time in your life, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=615.22s)]
*  to how she responds. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=618.1s)]
*  House oversight says they've got bank records [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=620.5400000000001s)]
*  showing a Chinese energy company paying three Biden [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=623.26s)]
*  family members through a third party. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=626.34s)]
*  What were they paid for? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=628.62s)]
*  Look, I'm just not gonna respond to that from here. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=630.62s)]
*  Look, we have heard from House Republicans for years [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=633.46s)]
*  and years and years, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=638.14s)]
*  how the inaccuracies and lies when it comes to this issue. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=640.14s)]
*  And I don't even where to begin to even answer that question, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=645.26s)]
*  because again, it's been lies and lies and inaccuracy [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=649.38s)]
*  for the past couple of years, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=652.0200000000001s)]
*  and I'm just not gonna get into it from here. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=653.62s)]
*  Yeah, just not getting it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=656.1400000000001s)]
*  Here's some bank records. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=657.22s)]
*  Here's some numbers on paper that no one disputes are real. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=659.1800000000001s)]
*  What do you say to this? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=662.74s)]
*  Republicans lies years. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=663.6600000000001s)]
*  In other words, you're sopping wet, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=666.4200000000001s)]
*  the water seems to be coming from the sky. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=669.26s)]
*  Is it raining? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=671.74s)]
*  Lies, lies. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=672.62s)]
*  Of course, that's their response. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=676.38s)]
*  They always accuse you of exactly [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=677.46s)]
*  what they themselves are doing. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=679.02s)]
*  Remember when they told you that John Fetterman [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=680.34s)]
*  was totally qualified to be a Senator, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=681.78s)]
*  and he had no debilitating mental issues whatsoever. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=684.26s)]
*  In fact, he's way sharper than you are. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=687.6999999999999s)]
*  Shut up, Dumbo. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=690.2199999999999s)]
*  Whatever happened to John Fetterman, by the way? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=692.38s)]
*  Where is he? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=694.9399999999999s)]
*  He's supposed to be serving in the US Senate. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=695.78s)]
*  Can someone take a picture of him [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=697.06s)]
*  holding up today's paper so we can be certain? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=698.18s)]
*  But Korean John Peter doesn't care. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=703.2199999999999s)]
*  Republicans lies, it's been years. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=704.5s)]
*  And of course, she has to say that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=707.42s)]
*  because she does not want to get into the details [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=708.8199999999999s)]
*  about what her own boss, the President of the United States, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=711.66s)]
*  is saying, who really seems, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=715.1s)]
*  and will concede in a very amusing way, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=716.98s)]
*  utterly disconnected from reality. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=718.8199999999999s)]
*  So he began his campaign, you probably remember, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=721.26s)]
*  right around 2019, from telling us [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=723.9399999999999s)]
*  how he liberated Nelson Mandela from Robben Island, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=726.1s)]
*  from prison in South Africa, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=729.18s)]
*  and it's just gotten more florid from there. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=731.54s)]
*  And we are absolutely determined to be amused by Joe Biden. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=733.38s)]
*  So here he is telling you that during Selma, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=737.62s)]
*  he was actually at the forefront of civil rights. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=742.62s)]
*  He may have been on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=744.14s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=745.62s)]
*  I was a student up north in the civil rights movement. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=746.7s)]
*  I remember feeling how guilty I was. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=750.98s)]
*  I wasn't here. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=754.18s)]
*  How could we all be up there? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=756.1s)]
*  And you going through what you went through, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=758.18s)]
*  looking at those, I can still picture, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=759.58s)]
*  you still picture troopers with batons and wands and whips. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=762.26s)]
*  Can you even imagine what Joe Biden's [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=767.1800000000001s)]
*  actual racial attitudes were in 1963 in Delaware? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=769.46s)]
*  It was the same Joe Biden told us he was in the car [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=774.34s)]
*  with his dad 60 years ago, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=776.58s)]
*  and saw two men in downtown Wilmington kissing each other. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=778.1s)]
*  And his father said, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=781.94s)]
*  Joe, you've got to support gay marriage. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=782.7800000000001s)]
*  So there's something almost metaphysical going on here. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=787.34s)]
*  You have people who believe if they say something, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=790.1s)]
*  it will become true. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=793.3000000000001s)]
*  Their words will create reality itself. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=794.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=798.34s)]
*  That's the same standard, by the way, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=800.3000000000001s)]
*  that the Biden administration seems to be applying [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=801.1s)]
*  to what's happening to the former president [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=805.22s)]
*  and to children and gender ideology. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=808.62s)]
*  They want you to believe that eight-year-old boys [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=811.34s)]
*  can become women overnight just by wishing for it. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=813.14s)]
*  That's why Kamala Harris just sent a letter [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=815.9000000000001s)]
*  praising a man dressed as a woman. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=817.6600000000001s)]
*  That's why she goes around yapping about her pronouns. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=820.62s)]
*  We can't resist this clip. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=822.58s)]
*  It's too great. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=823.5400000000001s)]
*  I am Kamala Harris. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  My pronouns are she and her. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=825.98s)]
*  I'm a woman sitting at the table wearing a blue suit. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=827.38s)]
*  So we're not gonna say anything snarky about that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=832.46s)]
*  That's just so great. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=834.34s)]
*  And if there's one piece of video evidence [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=835.58s)]
*  that we can save and the time capsule [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=838.98s)]
*  inside all of our hearts [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=840.9399999999999s)]
*  to represent what it was like to live in this country [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=842.54s)]
*  in 2023, it's that right there. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=845.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=847.78s)]
*  She, her, my pronouns, and I'm wearing a pantsuit. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=849.42s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=852.34s)]
*  So one of the great lies going on right now [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=854.54s)]
*  is that the former president of the United States, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=856.5799999999999s)]
*  who was also once again the front runner [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=858.3399999999999s)]
*  for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=860.3s)]
*  has committed some kind of crime in the state of New York [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=862.02s)]
*  for which at some point he's going to be indicted. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=866.42s)]
*  Now we could have had a lot of people on to talk about this. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=870.18s)]
*  Trump defenders, people who voted for Trump. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=872.86s)]
*  We thought it would be more credible [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=874.74s)]
*  and probably a lot more interesting to have someone [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=876.06s)]
*  who did not vote for Trump, who does not agree with Trump, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=877.9399999999999s)]
*  but who's pretty serious about the law [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=880.62s)]
*  and has spent his life in it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYSGbd_9CA&t=882.62s)]
