# GOP lawmaker shares how heâ€™s holding China accountable
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY)
*  So, clearly it's too late to do anything about the Chinese military aircraft that just hovered over some of our nuclear launch sites. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=0.0s)]
*  But some members of Congress are taking the threat from China seriously. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey is one of them. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=11.52s)]
*  He is the chairman of the new bipartisan China Commission. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=13.92s)]
*  He just introduced a bill to strip China of trade privileges. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=16.32s)]
*  He's also introduced legislation to remove trade offices in the U.S. that are effectively controlled by China. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=19.76s)]
*  Seems obvious that every Republican in the chamber would support this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=24.8s)]
*  Do you think they will? We're about to find out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Congressman Chris Smith joins us tonight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=29.68s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=32.32s)]
*  Pretty straightforward piece of legislation from what I can tell. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=34.64s)]
*  Are we going to strip China of its trade privileges? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=39.36s)]
*  How many I think we members are supporting this? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=41.88s)]
*  Well, we're building a group. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=46.08s)]
*  We've talked. I've talked to a lot of people and we're going to get co-sponsors and a lot of them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=47.6s)]
*  You know, back in May 26, 1994, President Bill Clinton severed the relationship between human rights and trade. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=52.6s)]
*  And that's when we lost China. That's when we lost it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=63.24s)]
*  That's when they said all they care about is profits. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=66.16s)]
*  And in came the multilateral corporations to make money hand over fist, exploiting the local workforce under Xi Jinping. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=69.08s)]
*  They've gone from bad to extremely worse. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  The Uyghurs are being subjected to genocide. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=79.91999999999999s)]
*  Religious freedom is being decimated all over China. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  So the oppressor and Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party are horribly oppressing the people of China. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  Taiwan could be next. And certainly Hong Kong now has been largely lost. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=94.28s)]
*  So our bill says, Bill Clinton, you had it right when you were saying there ought to be linkage between human rights and trade. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  I'm taking that whole template and saying we need to do it and we need to do it now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=105.44s)]
*  You know, China is an exporting nation, as you know so well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=110.44s)]
*  Without exports, that economy drives to a dribble. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=113.4s)]
*  We need to say, unless you make serious and sustained progress in ending torture, political prisoners, concentration camps, forced abortion, all the horrible things. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=116.56s)]
*  I just had a hearing in July, Tucker, on this horrible practice of stealing people's organs. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=126.08s)]
*  50 to 100,000 people, 100,000 victims every year who are killed to get their organs. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  And they go after 28 years old. That's what was brought out in our hearing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=139.16s)]
*  And it's from people like Christians and Tibetan Buddhists, Uyghurs and the Falun Gong practitioners. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=143.88s)]
*  This is something that is Nazi like and it's going on right now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=149.84s)]
*  So we're saying they have to clean up their act or else their ability to send their exports to US markets will be severely [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=154.24s)]
*  and substantially tariffed. And that's what this bill does. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=161.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, people like Larry Flink, Larry Fink of BlackRock, suck up to the Chinese, the middle of the genocide, the lecture us on George Flink. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  I bet you this is probably the only lever that could get any change at all in our relationship with China. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=173.16s)]
*  And of course, we wish you the best of luck. You're going to need it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=178.56s)]
*  Congressman, Chris. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=181.8s)]
*  Tucker, thank you. And it will make a difference. It will make a difference. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Had Clinton not delinked human rights and trade, we would have a different China today. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=185.4s)]
*  That's when we lost them. And intellectual property rights are also included in our bill. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=189.32s)]
*  They have to stop stealing our secrets. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=193.6s)]
*  Yeah. The one thing they care about is trade for sure. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=198.68s)]
*  Thank you so much, Tucker. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCCS-SZfJtY&t=200.48s)]
