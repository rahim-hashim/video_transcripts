# Tucker: This is how dumb CNN is
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 15, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's Night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=0.0s)]
*  We're gonna start with an obvious observation. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  That's what we specialize in. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=4.46s)]
*  It feels like this country is losing control of inflation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=6.28s)]
*  It feels like it's getting worse. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=9.6s)]
*  In Dallas over the weekend, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=11.34s)]
*  a bottle of water was going for $8. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=12.56s)]
*  That's water, which we used to get for free from the sky. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=15.16s)]
*  Now eight bucks. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=17.8s)]
*  And people are paying it too. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=19.52s)]
*  If you were thirsty in downtown Dallas on Saturday morning, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=20.76s)]
*  you didn't really have a choice. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=23.28s)]
*  This is not a small development. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=25.32s)]
*  Inflation will make this country poor [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=27.16s)]
*  and it will do it faster than anything else will. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=29.7s)]
*  Anyone who doesn't understand that intuitively is an idiot [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=31.82s)]
*  or is irresponsible or both. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=34.62s)]
*  If you think COVID or climate change or police brutality [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=36.64s)]
*  or Iran is a bigger threat to the United States [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=40.14s)]
*  than the devaluation of the US dollar, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=43.22s)]
*  then you by definition [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=45.5s)]
*  should not be making meaningful decisions. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=46.72s)]
*  You're a moron. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  So with that standard in mind, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=50.42s)]
*  let's check in with our friends over at CNN [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=51.46s)]
*  to see what they're covering today on their news channel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=53.14s)]
*  Oh, it looks like they're planning a palace coup [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=55.9s)]
*  with the White House just another day in Washington. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=57.699999999999996s)]
*  Turns out CNN's researchers have discovered [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=60.54s)]
*  that Joe Biden is elderly and unpopular. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=63.14s)]
*  Breaking news. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=65.82s)]
*  And therefore he's probably not the best vehicle [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=66.74s)]
*  for the ambitions of the Democratic party going forward. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=69.17999999999999s)]
*  Obviously Biden isn't gonna serve two terms. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=71.66s)]
*  So as a public service, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=74.22s)]
*  CNN has assembled a list of people [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=75.42s)]
*  who should replace Joe Biden. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=76.94s)]
*  It's all pretty amusing when you think about it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=79.3s)]
*  Apparently somebody in CNN's math department [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=81.34s)]
*  finally finished the complicated calculations [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=83.78s)]
*  and concluded that Joe Biden, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=86.18s)]
*  who's already had two cerebral aneurysms, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=87.78s)]
*  will be 86 years old by the end of his second term. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=92.62s)]
*  86 years old? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=93.86000000000001s)]
*  CNN had no idea Joe Biden was that old. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=95.5s)]
*  Didn't tell us about it either. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=98.9s)]
*  Clearly this is not gonna work. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=99.9s)]
*  Time for someone new. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=101.2s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=103.18s)]
*  And honestly, as you watch this, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=104.78s)]
*  you can start to feel a little sad for Joe Biden. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=106.2s)]
*  He's been in office less than a year [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=108.98s)]
*  and already his own supporters are measuring his coffin. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=110.54s)]
*  But of course they are. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  This was always going to happen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=115.6s)]
*  Professional Democrats are not sentimental people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=118.14s)]
*  They're stony-hearted realists. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden has served his biological purpose. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=122.96s)]
*  He stopped Bernie Sanders in the primaries. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=125.36s)]
*  He made America safe for private equity. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=127.82s)]
*  Carried interest is still in the tax code. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=131.14s)]
*  Mission accomplished. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=132.88s)]
*  So it's time to pull Joe Biden off the stage [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=133.92s)]
*  before he gets even older and less popular. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  That's what they're thinking. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=139.18s)]
*  It turns out supporting Joe Biden [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=140.66s)]
*  was never about any specific ideology. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=142.12s)]
*  We on the right fell for that one, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=144.12s)]
*  but these people have no interest in principles or ideas. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=145.52s)]
*  Loyalty is a foreign concept to them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=148.34s)]
*  They care only about power. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=150.86s)]
*  It's kind of scary really. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  Thankfully, this same group is also stupid. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  Stupidity is their one redeeming quality. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=159.08s)]
*  If they were smart, they'd take over the world. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  They're certainly ruthless enough. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=163.02s)]
*  But thank God they can't do that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  because they're too limited by their own bigotries [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=165.78s)]
*  and their tiny intellects. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=168.02s)]
*  How dumb are these people? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=169.96s)]
*  Well, they assume that everybody else is just like them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=171.92s)]
*  And that's always the hallmark of true stupidity. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  These are the geniuses who believe Salvadoran immigrants [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=178.72s)]
*  want to be called Latinx. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  They can believe that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=183.48s)]
*  because they don't talk to Salvadoran immigrants. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  They only talk at them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=186.22s)]
*  So they have no idea that the average Salvadoran [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=188.06s)]
*  has social views that are so terrifyingly right wing, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  they would be banned on Twitter instantly [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=193.38s)]
*  assuming Salvadoran immigrants actually use Twitter, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=195.16s)]
*  which most of them don't [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=197.0s)]
*  because they're smarter than CNN anchors. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=197.84s)]
*  Remember when Nancy Pelosi was out there [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  a couple of years ago talking about MS-13 [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=200.44s)]
*  when they were terrorizing Salvadoran immigrant communities [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=203.0s)]
*  and she was assuring us they were little angels. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=205.24s)]
*  They're children of God, she said. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=206.88s)]
*  CNN never sent a camera to an actual Salvadoran community [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=208.26s)]
*  to ask what they thought of MS-13. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=212.6s)]
*  The people terrorized them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=214.52s)]
*  What do you think we should do with MS-13? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=215.48s)]
*  Well, cut them into small pieces and feed them to the dogs. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=216.72s)]
*  That would have been the answer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=219.28s)]
*  Didn't see that on CNN. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=220.12s)]
*  What's their views on the trans community, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=221.96s)]
*  you'd have to wonder. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=223.52s)]
*  They're not put that on the air either. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=224.64s)]
*  CNN hasn't even thought about doing those interviews [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=226.0s)]
*  because they assume they don't need to. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=229.56s)]
*  The people at CNN believe that everyone [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=231.48s)]
*  who didn't vote for Donald Trump [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=233.28s)]
*  must have the same opinions and concerns [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=235.36s)]
*  as the average dingbat, trust-a-farian and bozeman. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=237.72s)]
*  They imagine a world populated entirely [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=241.24s)]
*  by people like themselves, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=243.38s)]
*  college-educated liberals with empty personal lives. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=244.96s)]
*  And thank God they're wrong. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=247.34s)]
*  A world like that would be as sterile and bossy [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  and anti-human as the White House press secretary. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  Imagine 8 billion Jen Psaki's. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=254.88s)]
*  Horrifying. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  But in reality, humanity is far more interesting [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=259.24s)]
*  and far more, yes, diverse than that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=262.54s)]
*  Not that CNN has caught on. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=264.0s)]
*  Nor do they have any idea how unpopular they are. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=266.0s)]
*  Most Americans are not racist, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  no matter what you might hear, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  but an awful lot of them secretly do hate [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=272.98s)]
*  the nasty, uptight, self-righteous, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  entitled white liberals who run CNN and people like them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=278.6s)]
*  If you were to ask your average Trump voter, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=282.48s)]
*  who do you really dislike? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=284.8s)]
*  Not that anyone would ever ask them that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=286.12s)]
*  because nobody cares what they think, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=287.72s)]
*  but if you were, they'd probably say to the CNN camera crew, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  actually, I'm not mad at black people, I'm mad at you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=292.08s)]
*  Dislike of that group of people, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=297.64s)]
*  the people of all the power in this country, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=299.72s)]
*  is probably the deepest well of prejudice [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=301.44s)]
*  in the United States, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=303.68s)]
*  and of course it's totally justified. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=304.52s)]
*  Does CNN know that? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=305.76s)]
*  No, of course they have no idea. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=306.6s)]
*  Wait till you see their list of replacements for Joe Biden. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  Each one is tailor-made to appeal [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  to the dingbat, trust-afarian, embozeman, and no one else. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=314.64s)]
*  First on the list, of course, is Kamala Harris, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=318.44s)]
*  and that makes sense, she's the vice president. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=320.2s)]
*  The problem is, nobody likes Kamala Harris. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=322.44s)]
*  No one has ever liked Kamala Harris, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=325.2s)]
*  from her earliest days on the playground [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=327.4s)]
*  to her high school years in Canada, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=329.28s)]
*  to right now, which is December 15th, 2021. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=330.64s)]
*  Why is Kamala Harris so unpopular? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=334.28s)]
*  Because here's what she's like. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  And is that a socialist or progressive perspective? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=343.32s)]
*  The value of educators when they had to bring their kids. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=345.04s)]
*  It actually was Mike Pence on the debate stage. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=354.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  But... [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=357.68s)]
*  And said, where's Kamala? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  And apparently, they left me like a block behind, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  I followed out the struggle. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  Woo! [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=372.48s)]
*  What's up? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=377.32s)]
*  And I looked back up and I said, freedom! [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=379.04s)]
*  So Kamala Harris is a charmless phony [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=384.56s)]
*  who has such total and utter contempt for your intelligence [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=387.16s)]
*  that she fully expects you to believe [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=390.56s)]
*  that her fake laugh is real. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's bad, but honestly, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  it's not necessarily a deal killer in politics. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=395.68s)]
*  No one ever called Richard Nixon charming, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  yet Nixon won the biggest presidential landslide [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  in American history in 1970s. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=403.12s)]
*  So what's the difference? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=404.68s)]
*  The difference is Richard Nixon was competent. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  He had skills, he could do things. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris doesn't and she can't. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  Kamala Harris is totally incompetent. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=411.92s)]
*  She has zero skills, she's never done anything. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=413.64000000000004s)]
*  Harris can't redecorate her own office. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  She tried recently and she made it uglier. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  So this isn't gonna work. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=421.32000000000005s)]
*  We're gonna have to take Kamala Harris off the list. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=422.24s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=423.92s)]
*  So how about Pete Buttigieg? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  He's on the list, of course. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=426.76s)]
*  Everyone at CNN loves Pete Buttigieg. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=428.04s)]
*  She's just like them except a little spicier [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=430.08s)]
*  and much more glib. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=432.2s)]
*  Until a few years ago, Pete Buttigieg dated women. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  Now he's openly gay and a father [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=436.2s)]
*  and reads the Atlantic magazine [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=438.28s)]
*  and uses unintelligible buzzwords. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=439.68s)]
*  Many, many unintelligible buzzwords. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=441.76s)]
*  In fact, unintelligible buzzwords [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=444.4s)]
*  are Pete Buttigieg's entire vocabulary. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  You wanna talk like Pete Buttigieg, it's not hard. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=448.56s)]
*  Take a phrase or issue, any phrase or any issue [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=450.84s)]
*  and add the word racism, bingo. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=454.44s)]
*  You now have a promising future in the Democratic Party. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=456.44s)]
*  Do you think that people who support President Trump [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  and his immigration policies are racist? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=462.48s)]
*  Anyone who supports this is supporting racism. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=465.12s)]
*  Our healthcare system is burdened by racism. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=468.12s)]
*  We know that our housing is burdened by racism. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=471.44s)]
*  Our schools are burdened by racism. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=473.88s)]
*  Yes, the uniform is burdened by racism, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=476.24s)]
*  but it goes far beyond that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=479.04s)]
*  It is a matter of concern for every American [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=480.36s)]
*  that we dismantle systemic racism [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=484.24s)]
*  before it ends the American project in our lifetime. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=486.64s)]
*  Oh, and roads are racist too. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  Certain kinds of people love this. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=493.92s)]
*  If CNN anchors could do science, which of course they can't, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=495.68s)]
*  but if they could, Pete Buttigieg is the candidate [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=498.44s)]
*  they would create in their basement lab. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=501.32s)]
*  Rhodes scholar, McKinsey consultant, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=503.56s)]
*  no actual achievements of any kind. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=505.6s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg couldn't even run South Bend, Indiana. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  He tried, couldn't, and that's not really surprising. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=510.8s)]
*  Buttigieg has never shown any interest [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=513.8000000000001s)]
*  in improving the lives of actual people. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  His only real skill is talking about himself. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=518.0s)]
*  Every presidential election cycle, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=520.72s)]
*  you see someone like this. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=522.48s)]
*  Democratic candidates who are in effect media creations. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=524.28s)]
*  The New York Times pretends they could actually get elected, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=527.08s)]
*  but no, every election cycle, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=529.28s)]
*  the voters laugh at these people. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=531.64s)]
*  Ask Beto, he's been there. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=533.32s)]
*  So Pete Buttigieg is off the list, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=535.84s)]
*  but in his defense, whatever Buttigieg's fault, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=538.52s)]
*  at least he's not Elizabeth Warren. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=541.12s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren is the candidate for voters [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=543.2s)]
*  who find Kamala Harris too authentic. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=545.42s)]
*  Kamala's just too real for me. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=548.24s)]
*  I'd rather have the manufactured version, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=549.16s)]
*  someone who pretends to be say an American Indian. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=551.28s)]

*  you're gonna love Elizabeth Warren. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=556.02s)]

*  That's not gonna fly. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=587.28s)]

*  as old and familiar as Joe Biden is, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=591.12s)]

*  someone whose faults the country [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=595.04s)]

*  A couple of years ago, Pritzker broke his leg [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=613.88s)]
*  and then admitted he had no idea how he did it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=615.84s)]
*  He hasn't seen his legs since 1993. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=618.12s)]
*  Now we're not judging, obviously, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=620.24s)]

*  though thanks to J.B. Pritzker, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  there are far fewer of them every day. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  But CNN did not bother to interview a single one of them. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=639.2399999999999s)]
*  So go ahead and wish J.B. Pritzker the best, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=642.76s)]
*  but don't count on seeing him in the White House [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=644.76s)]
*  anytime soon. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  But if you're still fixated on replacing Joe Biden [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=647.56s)]
*  with a governor, CNN has a few more ideas for you. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=651.3599999999999s)]
*  CNN is recommending Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=654.28s)]
*  and Phil Murphy of New Jersey. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  Now you read that and you pause [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  and you begin to suspect that maybe this whole list [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=661.96s)]
*  is CNN's stealthy attempt to test you, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  to see what you will believe. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=667.6s)]
*  How ludicrous can they write it? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=668.72s)]
*  Phil Murphy? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=670.72s)]
*  Phil Murphy almost lost his job just last month. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=672.48s)]
*  He was nearly defeated as an incumbent Democrat governor [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  in a state that has a million more Democrats [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=680.08s)]
*  than it has Republicans. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=682.2800000000001s)]
*  How much do people in New Jersey hate Phil Murphy? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=684.48s)]
*  That's how much they hate him. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=686.2800000000001s)]
*  But now he should be president? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=689.44s)]
*  It feels like some pothead intern at CNN [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=690.8s)]
*  just pulled up the Wikipedia entry for Democratic governors [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=692.92s)]
*  and then copied their names into the story. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=695.84s)]
*  That's gotta be what happened. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=697.68s)]
*  How else did Gretchen Whitmer make the list? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=699.48s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=702.28s)]
*  You should also know that CNN recommends a former mayor. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=704.0s)]
*  That would be Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=706.4399999999999s)]
*  Now you'll be excited about this if you think [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=708.3199999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden's hair plugs aren't quite absurd enough. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=710.08s)]
*  Otherwise, huh? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=713.12s)]
*  Actually, Mitch Landrieu is a perfectly nice guy. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=715.56s)]
*  He's charming and friendly. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=717.04s)]
*  But the question is, how's New Orleans doing these days? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=718.88s)]
*  Is it cleaner? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=722.16s)]
*  Is it safer? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=723.2s)]
*  Is it a better place to live? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=724.04s)]
*  How are the schools? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=725.48s)]
*  Come on. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=727.36s)]
*  If you've been there, you know. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=728.2s)]
*  On the other hand, if Mitch Landrieu is gonna make the list, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=729.76s)]
*  then why not Bill de Blasio? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=732.56s)]
*  Why doesn't Bill de Blasio replace Joe Biden? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=734.96s)]
*  He certainly has got the time to do it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=737.64s)]
*  He's unemployed. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=738.84s)]
*  This could be Bill de Blasio's chance [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=740.24s)]
*  to turn all of America into Penn Station. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=741.92s)]
*  What a campaign slogan that would be. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=745.56s)]
*  Bill de Blasio 2024, make America filthy again. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=746.84s)]
*  We can't wait for CNN's endorsement of that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=750.24s)]
*  No doubt it's coming. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=751.88s)]
*  So by this point, we're getting toward the bottom [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=753.84s)]
*  of CNN's Biden replacement list. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=755.64s)]
*  And that's where we find the name of one Stacey Abrams. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=757.6s)]
*  Abrams was once a state representative in Georgia. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=761.12s)]
*  Now she describes herself as a quote, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=763.24s)]
*  voting rights activist, whatever that is. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=764.64s)]
*  Electing Stacey Abrams president of the United States [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=767.5600000000001s)]
*  would amount to the single largest act of equity [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=770.76s)]
*  ever committed in the modern era. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=773.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, would also signal the end [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=776.0s)]
*  of the modern era. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=777.92s)]
*  You know exactly the kind of country you would get [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=779.24s)]
*  with Stacey Abrams in charge. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=781.44s)]
*  Is she unqualified for the job? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=782.92s)]
*  Oh, of course she's unqualified. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=784.64s)]
*  But she's also, and this is an extra bonus, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=786.64s)]
*  totally delusional. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=788.48s)]
*  To this day, more than three years after the fact, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=790.04s)]
*  Abrams have never conceded that she lost [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=793.12s)]
*  the Georgia governor's race. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=795.6s)]
*  She still claims that election was stolen from her. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=796.92s)]
*  But wait a second, you ask. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=800.36s)]
*  Isn't that an attack on democracy? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=803.08s)]
*  When you challenge an election result in this country, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=805.64s)]
*  you are, as Liz Cheney often tells us, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=808.4s)]
*  shredding democratic norms. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=810.08s)]
*  You might as well be living in Moscow at that point [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=812.52s)]
*  because you, my friend, are doing the bidding [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=814.84s)]
*  of Vladimir Putin. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=816.28s)]
*  You're an insurrectionist. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=817.24s)]
*  And yet, Stacey Abrams is not living in Moscow. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=819.12s)]
*  She's living in Atlanta. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=822.96s)]
*  In pretty luxurious circumstances, actually, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=824.4s)]
*  all made possible by the huge amounts of cash [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  she has raised fighting for quote, voting rights. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=829.08s)]
*  A few years ago, Abrams spent nearly a million [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=832.32s)]
*  and a half dollars on residential real estate for herself, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=834.36s)]
*  despite owing the Internal Revenue Service [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=837.24s)]
*  $54,000 in back taxes. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=839.7600000000001s)]
*  Now that is equity in action. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=842.08s)]
*  So once again, you know precisely who Stacey Abrams is. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=845.4000000000001s)]
*  But still, there is something about her [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=848.96s)]
*  that's not quite as repulsive as the rest of the people [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=851.1600000000001s)]
*  on CNN's list. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=854.84s)]
*  Say what you will about Stacey Abrams. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=855.84s)]
*  She's not synthetic. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  She's no Pete Buttigieg, who was clearly implanted [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=859.4000000000001s)]
*  with some kind of neoliberal master chip [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=862.08s)]
*  when he worked at McKinsey. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=864.08s)]
*  Must stop climate change now. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=865.1600000000001s)]
*  No, Stacey Abrams isn't really like that. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=867.88s)]
*  She's a grifter, obviously, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=869.88s)]
*  but there is still a spark of recognizable humanity [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=872.48s)]
*  within her. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=875.24s)]
*  She's clearly got an active personal life. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=876.08s)]
*  Here's an excerpt from the softcore porn novel [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=878.0s)]
*  she wrote called Hidden Sins. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=880.6800000000001s)]
*  Their tongues tangled, danced, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=890.1600000000001s)]
*  and she reveled in the movement. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=893.12s)]
*  She splayed eager palms against his chest [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=895.56s)]
*  and tormented the flesh she found there. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=898.92s)]
*  Too far away, she gripped his waist to pull him closer [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=902.32s)]
*  until she stood cradled between his hard thighs. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=907.0s)]
*  That voiceover comes from our highly talented producer, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=913.24s)]
*  Mr. Alex McCaskill, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=915.88s)]
*  but imagine Stacey Abrams doing the same thing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=916.92s)]
*  Imagine Stacey Abrams standing on the west front [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=920.88s)]
*  of the Capitol building three years from now [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=923.6s)]
*  at her inauguration, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  reading her own words from Hidden Sins [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=926.84s)]
*  as she faces the slender but rigid Washington monument. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=929.8s)]
*  Somehow, strange as it sounds, we can imagine that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=933.48s)]
*  In fact, we can imagine it vividly. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=936.08s)]
*  CNN would be thrilled by the whole thing, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=937.96s)]
*  and we know for certain that Jeff Toobin would cover it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJpIwBGT40&t=939.32s)]
