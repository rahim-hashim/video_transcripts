# Biden administration targets Amish farmer with armed raid and $300K fine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo)
*  And we wouldn't know about it if it were not for Jeremy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=0.0s)]
*  Lufredo, who works for Rebel News. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=2.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=3.88s)]
*  Jeremy, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=5.4s)]
*  This one's stories is kind of hard to believe. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=7.28s)]
*  They're going after an Amish farmer. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Who are they, exactly? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=12.48s)]
*  We have the US Marshals Service recently [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=14.8s)]
*  raided Amos Miller's organic and holistic farm, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=18.04s)]
*  demanding he cease operations. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  And they charged him, as you said, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=24.2s)]
*  with $300,000 of fines, economically crippling the man. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=26.56s)]
*  And what's happening is you have the armed federal agents [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=31.2s)]
*  are demanding he stop food production because of the meat. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=34.48s)]
*  And you have him saying, well, you know what? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=37.36s)]
*  I want to keep farming. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=41.16s)]
*  So you have this back and forth between the giant empire [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=42.44s)]
*  of the US federal government and this tiny little farm [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=45.56s)]
*  in Burdenhand, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=48.2s)]
*  So they went after gyms, organic farmers, and churches. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=50.44s)]
*  So maybe they're against anything [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=57.44s)]
*  that's wholesome and edifying that makes you stronger [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=59.36s)]
*  and healthier and in favor of everything that diminishes you [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=62.2s)]
*  and makes you more dependent. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=65.36s)]
*  I'm just sensing a theme here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=66.44s)]
*  Do you see this? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=67.64s)]
*  Yeah, and another thing the community says [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=69.24s)]
*  is that they're coming after Amos to set an example. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=71.44s)]
*  They're coming after an independent, successful farmer [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=74.44s)]
*  who takes out the government middlemen [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=77.44s)]
*  and provides food directly to his community and his people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=79.92s)]
*  Now, by taking out the middleman, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=83.4s)]
*  by taking out the government, you're taking power away [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  and taking leverage away from the government [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=87.72s)]
*  and putting that power and leverage [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=89.6s)]
*  in the hands of the community and the farmers and the people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=91.08s)]
*  And another thing I'll add is Amos' farm [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=94.76s)]
*  doesn't use any gasoline or any fertilizer. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=97.0s)]
*  Now, as you know, these commodities [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=100.16s)]
*  have become very expensive because of Biden's policies [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=101.88s)]
*  in regards to the war in Ukraine and Russia. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=104.76s)]
*  So Amos has completely eliminated any risk [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  coming from the international or domestic politics [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=111.84s)]
*  of the Biden administration, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  and they're coming after him for it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=115.92s)]
*  Maybe if he promises to put more chemicals in the milk [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=118.76s)]
*  that turn kids trans, they'll lay off. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=120.92s)]
*  Did any of the federal marshals [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=123.16s)]
*  decline to raid an Amish organic farm on principle, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  or did they all just go along with this? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=128.44s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=130.24s)]
*  All I know is that many federal agents [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  did not decline to go and did go along with it [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=135.44s)]
*  and raided the farm and took inventory of Amos' farm [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=138.4s)]
*  to make sure that he doesn't sell or produce any more meat. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=143.4s)]
*  You know, we're for law enforcement, broadly speaking, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  but there's such a thing as conscience, okay? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=150.48s)]
*  And they should not have gone along with this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=152.48s)]
*  When they tell you to raid an organic Amish farm, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=154.36s)]
*  that's when you bow out, okay, I would say. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=156.72s)]
*  Jeremy, I appreciate your story that you did. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=159.12s)]
*  It's shocking to believe it's real, but it is. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=160.92s)]
*  We're thankful that you came. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=163.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oABmOolFo&t=165.32s)]
