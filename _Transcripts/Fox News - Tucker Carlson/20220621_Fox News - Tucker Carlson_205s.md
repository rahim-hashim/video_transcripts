# NCAA swimmer: Transgender ruling a step in right direction
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII)
*  So the world's body that governs swimming, it's called FINA, has finally banned men from competing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=0.0s)]
*  in women's swimming events. Took a while, but there's a catch. The new rule applies only to men [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=6.4s)]
*  who started their quote transition to womanhood, as if that's possible, after the age of 12. So in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=12.56s)]
*  other words, if parents decide to chemically castrate a male child at a young age, then the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=19.6s)]
*  body will allow that man to compete against women when they get older. What effect is this going to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=25.68s)]
*  have? Well, Riley Gaines has thought a lot about it. Riley Gaines is an NCAA swimmer, swim against [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Leah Thomas. She joins us tonight. Riley, thanks so much for coming on. So you've been almost [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  single-handedly bringing this topic to public attention. Many of your fellow swimmers are [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=42.24s)]
*  embarrassed, so thank you for doing it again. How do you feel about this ruling? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=48.16s)]
*  I definitely think it's a step in the right direction. It's a bold first step. Obviously, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=52.96s)]
*  it's not everything. We need more organizations across a bunch of different sports to comply as [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=57.84s)]
*  well, but I think it's a very bold first step, and I think it's something worth celebrating. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=62.56s)]
*  Does that view reflect that of people you swim with? Do other swimmers feel that? I mean, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=68.0s)]
*  you're the sort of lens through which we understand swimming, because again, everyone else is afraid [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=72.64s)]
*  to come on TV and talk about it, but do you know people who agree with you? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I do for sure. Being someone who witnessed that first hand, being at that competition in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=79.36s)]
*  March, I saw the amount of tears shed, the extreme discomfort in the locker rooms, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=84.48s)]
*  the talk of anger and frustration, and so I definitely think that I'm speaking for a large [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=89.52s)]
*  majority here. So parents in the Ottoman Empire, a lot of them castrated their sons in the hope [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=94.72s)]
*  they would grow up to be the court eunuch, which is a position of real power. There's real benefit [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=99.84s)]
*  to castrating your children in the Ottoman Empire. I wonder if you think that's a good thing, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=103.2s)]
*  the Ottoman Empire. I wonder if this ruling doesn't set up a potential incentive for parents [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=107.52s)]
*  to give their young boys massive hormone treatments pre-puberty. Right, it's worth noting. I think that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=114.0s)]
*  having this set age, will it sway children? Will it encourage parents? Personally, I think it's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  unlikely, just because maybe I don't have much experience seeing those kinds of things, and so [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=128.8s)]
*  that's why I do think this is a step in the right direction, but it's definitely [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  kind of worth taking into account that strict age that they set. It's a little scary. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=138.48s)]
*  Last question, and I meant to ask you this before, but why haven't more coaches spoken out about, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=146.32s)]
*  these people who devoted their lives to women swimming and they're seeing this cheating going on, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  and yet I haven't heard any of them say a word about it in public. Why? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=158.16s)]
*  Right, I think it's because obviously we live in this kind of cancel culture. I think they fear for [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=161.52s)]
*  their jobs. They have higher-ups above them who could be intimidating them or threatening them, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=168.56s)]
*  and so I think that they're scared to speak out about it, but the more voices, whether it be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=173.84s)]
*  athletes, coaches, non-athletes, it really matters, and so to have those voices, it really weighs a lot. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=179.12s)]
*  Yeah, it does, and yours does. I hope you're rewarded someday for your bravery. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=187.36s)]
*  Raleigh, thank you for joining us. I mean it. Thanks. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMKn1N8vsII&t=193.28s)]
