# Human smugglers get the message the border is open
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw)
*  The Biden administration clearly isn't worried at all about the crisis at the southern border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't think they're paying attention to it at all. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=5.8s)]
*  This is proof by the fact that Joe Biden is now heading to St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=8.4s)]
*  Islands for some sun, rest, and relaxation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=13.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, gangs and human traffickers not only have free run of the border, they basically [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=17.92s)]
*  control it as they're profiting heavily, fueling their criminal enterprise. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=23.6s)]
*  But they're not only taking over the Texas border. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=29.04s)]
*  Arizona is also in this crisis in crosshairs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  This month alone, customs officials at a single port of entry in the state of Arizona in Nogales [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=35.28s)]
*  seized roughly two million fentanyl pills. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Last month, that very same port of entry seized more than three million fentanyl pills. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=44.08s)]
*  And of course, that's just what CBP was able to detect. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=49.04s)]
*  The full extent of the drug trafficking and human trafficking that's occurring and the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=53.12s)]
*  consequences on our country, especially through our border in Arizona, this is almost impossible [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=57.2s)]
*  to measure. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=63.36s)]
*  Our government, both Democrats and Republicans, have clearly failed to secure our borders, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=65.12s)]
*  either because they just don't care about the American people, our security, or our country, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=71.04s)]
*  or they're totally incompetent. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  Mexico, certainly not doing anything to secure its own borders and keep people from entering [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=78.08s)]
*  our country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=83.12s)]
*  They're essentially a narco state that is controlled by and facilitating these cartels, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=83.76s)]
*  who are the ones who are winning in all of this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  And so the result is that like Texas, Arizona is also experiencing an unprecedented wave [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  of illegal migration. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=97.36s)]
*  But keep in mind, the impact doesn't stop there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=99.28s)]
*  It doesn't stop at our border states, because they're just way stations for the surge of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=101.44s)]
*  illegal migration that frankly is impacting every state across the country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=106.64s)]
*  Now, The Daily Callers Jorge Ventura was at the Yuma border in the middle of the night, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=112.16s)]
*  just before Christmas. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=116.72s)]
*  Here's some disturbing footage of what he saw. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=118.56s)]
*  We are approaching four in the morning here in Yuma, Arizona. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=121.6s)]
*  This is the current scene. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=124.16s)]
*  We're seeing a massive line here of migrants from all over the world, from Russia, Peru, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Brazil, Colombia, Cuba. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=129.68s)]
*  This is one of the more sophisticated human smuggling operations. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=132.32s)]
*  This once again shows, we're taking here this massive line here, this is once again shows [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=134.96s)]
*  the amount of control the Mexican drug cartels have on this border. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=139.76s)]
*  Secretary Margaritas continues to say that the border is closing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=143.84s)]
*  This massive line shows difference. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=146.56s)]
*  Ali Bradley of NewsNation reported today that she saw more than 400 migrants cross into Yuma [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  this morning alone. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=156.72s)]
*  Now, many of them, she said, are from Moldova, Russia, and Cuba. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=158.56s)]
*  And according to Bradley, quote, one Moldovan man told us he took an Uber [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  from Tijuana to this drop off point. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  And he says he was told the border is open. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  Now, as Jorge Ventura found, human smugglers have received that message loud and clear. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=173.28s)]
*  Ventura confirmed that many young people are being brought to the border by human smugglers. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=178.08s)]
*  So there we actually have the human smuggler. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  He's trying to flash his light to my camera and block us from filming him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=191.36s)]
*  He was actually calling me out yesterday for filming him here yesterday. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=196.0s)]
*  He's bringing another big group here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=200.08s)]
*  That's why he's using that stroke to block me from getting his face this time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=202.96s)]
*  As he's actually taking money payments right now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=205.84s)]
*  Officials in Arizona say they're not getting any help from the federal government in deterring [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=209.12s)]
*  this illegal migration and human trafficking. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  In fact, the Biden administration has successfully pressured Arizona to stop using shipping [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=217.04s)]
*  containers that they put up as makeshift barriers to keep illegal migrants out. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=222.48s)]
*  Now, Governor-elect Katie Hobbs has also vowed to stop using these containers as blockades. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=228.8s)]
*  In just a moment, we're going to speak to Mark Dannels, the sheriff of Cochise County, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  about the fight over those very shipping containers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  But first, we're going to go to The Daily Callers Jorge Ventura, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=241.36s)]
*  who shot the footage from Arizona that we just showed you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  Jorge, you are exposing the lie that the Biden administration is telling us about how the borders [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=248.08s)]
*  are secure and closed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  Tell us what's happening on the ground right now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=256.4s)]
*  In Yuma, Arizona is one of the more sophisticated human operations that I've reported. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=257.84s)]
*  I've been reporting in South Texas, California, and Arizona. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=261.84s)]
*  But in Yuma, what makes it particularly interesting is around two in the morning [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=264.4s)]
*  on the Mexican side, you'll see a massive wave of vehicle traffic. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=267.92s)]
*  After the migrants are dropped off, you'll see four or five human smugglers guide these migrants. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=270.96s)]
*  We're talking about hundreds of migrants from all over the world. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  So I got to meet migrants from Russia, Afghanistan, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Cuba. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=277.28s)]
*  There's being smuggled in the middle of the night, hundreds, overwhelming border patrol officials. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=283.44s)]
*  And luckily, we were able to track down one of those human smuggling routes, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=288.16s)]
*  get these smugglers on camera. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  What makes this actually more interesting, Tulsi, is how brazen these smugglers are, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=291.92s)]
*  walking on American soil and taking payments as they continue to smuggle hundreds. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=295.2s)]
*  And after we caught the smuggler on camera, he couldn't care less. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=299.36s)]
*  He just returned to the Mexican side and continued bringing groups. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=302.24s)]
*  And it just overwhelms border patrol officials on the Yuma side. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=305.04s)]
*  There was actually one point where it was around six in the morning. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=309.04s)]
*  I was staring at a group of 300 migrants with no border patrol agents to apprehend them or process [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=311.28s)]
*  them because they have to attend to other areas. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=315.76s)]
*  And it's just been a complete mess and disaster. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  And right now, the Mexican cartels have full control of the U.S. border. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  I know Secretary Mayorkas likes to say the border is secure. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  It is absolutely not. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  It's a different story on the ground. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  Jorge, thanks so much for showing people exactly what's really happening at the border. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=331.44s)]
*  Because if you watch the mainstream media, you listen to the Biden administration in Mayorkas, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=336.23999999999995s)]
*  they are blatantly lying to us. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=340.08s)]
*  And what you've just shown us again is who is actually in control at the border. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  It's those who are profiting the most, these cartels and human traffickers. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkPONpF0Vw&t=350.32s)]
