# Gaetz tells Tucker about drag queen story hours on military bases
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0)
*  If you wanted to destroy the most powerful military in the world, what would you do? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, among the many things you might try is hosting drag queen story hours on military bases for kids. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=3.2s)]
*  And today, Congressman Matt Gaetz, who represents maybe more uniform military than anybody in the Congress, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=10.0s)]
*  confronted the defense secretary about it directly. Watch. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=16.0s)]
*  How much taxpayer money should go to fund drag queen story hours on military bases? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=21.0s)]
*  You know, drag queen story hours is not something that the department funds. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=31.0s)]
*  Wait a second. That's actually not what the record seems to suggest. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=36.0s)]
*  You were going to fund one at Ramstein Air Force Base. That one got canceled. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=40.0s)]
*  But that's DOD insignia. That's a drag queen story hour for children. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=43.0s)]
*  Then also at Malstrom Air Force Base outside of Great Falls, Montana, you had a drag queen story hour for kids. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=48.0s)]
*  Who funded these things, Mr. Secretary? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=56.0s)]
*  Listen, drag shows are not something that the Department of Defense supports or funds. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=59.0s)]
*  Yeah, a liar. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=67.0s)]
*  Board member to defense contractor before he got this job. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=70.0s)]
*  So then Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, admitted that he was not aware military bases were hosting drag queen story hours. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=73.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=80.0s)]
*  Can I get copies of those? Because I'd like to take a look at those myself, actually. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=81.0s)]
*  Take a look and find out what actually is going on there because that's the first I'm hearing about that kind of stuff. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=84.0s)]
*  I don't read those news stories. I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=89.0s)]
*  I'd like to take a look at those because I don't agree with those. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=92.0s)]
*  Well, they're now in the official record. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=94.0s)]
*  I think those things shouldn't be happening. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=95.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for that admission. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah, actually, you'd like to go. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=99.0s)]
*  You know, kind of open-minded guy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=101.0s)]
*  Matt Gaetz represents North Florida in the U.S. Congress. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=104.0s)]
*  Even if he never passes a bill, it's worth having him there just for moments like this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=108.0s)]
*  It's amazing. What was your being on the questioning side? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=112.0s)]
*  What was your feeling about their responses? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=115.0s)]
*  America's top military leaders have brought misery to almost every part of the globe. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=118.0s)]
*  They have touched. They put Iran in a position of power in Iraq. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=123.0s)]
*  They armed ISIS in Syria. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=127.0s)]
*  They turned over Afghanistan to the Taliban in the bloodiest way possible. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=129.0s)]
*  We could have taken out the suicide bomber. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=133.0s)]
*  Didn't give the authorities. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=135.0s)]
*  They didn't even get the vengeance part right, Tucker. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=136.0s)]
*  When they were supposed to take out ISIS, they took out a family on the way to a barbecue. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=139.0s)]
*  And so now you see them trying to bring the misery and the ruin home to our country through this embrace of diversity, equity and inclusion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=143.0s)]
*  And this is real money. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=153.0s)]
*  Seventy million dollars they've requested for enhancements to diversity, equity and inclusion. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=154.0s)]
*  And this is the most divisive stuff possible. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=159.0s)]
*  And when I showed the secretary of defense evidence that was happening in Nevada, in Montana, in Virginia, he just said, nope, it's not happening. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=162.0s)]
*  And it makes you wonder, do these people have any sense of reality or is the pain the point, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=170.0s)]
*  whether it's DEI or the vaccine mandate, that they still don't have good answers for? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=176.0s)]
*  But in the end, it means that nobody wants to join the military and their recruiting numbers are dangerously down. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=181.0s)]
*  Do they see a connection between their reckless, crazy behavior and the unwillingness of people to join up voluntarily? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=188.0s)]
*  We are in a recruiting collapse and they say, well, we don't think DEI is the problem because we've sent out surveys and no one says it's the problem. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=195.0s)]
*  They don't realize that the people offended by this conduct aren't going to take their stupid survey. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=202.0s)]
*  Let me just be honest. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=207.0s)]
*  A great set, a great share of the people who fight in our military come from the American South. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=208.0s)]
*  And when you embrace these values that are so antithetical to the part of the country I represent, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=214.0s)]
*  you are really putting a downward pressure on the people we need to volunteer and fight, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=220.0s)]
*  not for some faraway land, not to go build some democracy out of sand in Arabia, but for our country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=225.0s)]
*  And you have to wonder whether it is incompetence or a purposeful purge. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=232.0s)]
*  I also pressed him on making sure we get our service members their full back pay and restoration of rank. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=237.0s)]
*  Austin said he would not do that in the absence of a legal requirement to do so. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=243.0s)]
*  So that is precisely the amendment I intend to offer to our National Defense Authorization Act. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=248.0s)]
*  Yeah. When you say you hate white men, you do kind of wonder like who's going to fight the wars then? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=253.0s)]
*  Because that's who's always fought the wars. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=257.0s)]
*  Well, General Milley maybe didn't go to the drag queen show because he was too busy getting in touch with his white rage still. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=259.0s)]
*  Who knows? But he gets credit for saying he wants to shut him down. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=264.0s)]
*  Loathsome. Matt Gates, thank you so much. Appreciate it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvB_HW6V1Z0&t=267.0s)]
