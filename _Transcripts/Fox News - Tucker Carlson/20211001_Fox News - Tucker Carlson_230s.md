# Tucker: US government needs to get serious about UFOs
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ)
*  That's our representatives just passed a defense bill, excuse me, that will cost more than [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  $770 billion. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=13.56s)]
*  We've told you about it previous nights this week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=14.56s)]
*  Some of it is hard to defend, but some of it is worthwhile and some of it is interesting. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=18.2s)]
*  So the bill includes a provision to create a permanent office under the defense secretary [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=23.36s)]
*  that will be tasked with investigating reports of UFOs. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=27.54s)]
*  That office would quote, carry out on an apartment wide basis the mission currently performed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=31.34s)]
*  by the unidentified aerial phenomenon task force. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=35.18s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=37.94s)]
*  It's unclear if the Senate will approve that provision. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=38.94s)]
*  We'll be watching. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=42.26s)]
*  Luis Elizondo led the Pentagon secret UFO task force for years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=43.26s)]
*  He joins us tonight to assess. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=47.28s)]
*  So thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  So what would this do if it becomes law and do we need it? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=50.8s)]
*  Yeah, Tucker, this is really historic. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=56.599999999999994s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  First of all, we absolutely need it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  It's a long time coming. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Frankly, we should have had it decades ago if you ask me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=62.76s)]
*  But it is historic and it's historic for several reasons. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=66.52s)]
*  In this obscure five pages that most people may not be aware of, it really says a lot. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=70.28s)]
*  First of all, it creates an environment where it disestablishes the UAP task force, which [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=76.18s)]
*  was a temporary capability to begin with and solidifies a permanent capability. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=81.34s)]
*  Two, it also forces the secretary defense to report on an annual basis to Congress what [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  we've learned about UAPs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=93.06s)]
*  Three, it also requires us to now work with our international friends and allies. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=94.58000000000001s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=99.66000000000001s)]
*  If that wasn't a big deal enough, two other items that I found very interesting. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=100.66s)]
*  Number four is that it and you kind of broke this story a few years ago. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=105.74s)]
*  It requires any recovered material associated with UAPs to finally be reported to Congress. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  And then last but not least, it also requires the government to report to Congress any adverse [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=116.69999999999999s)]
*  medical effects that have been encountered by our pilots who may have come up close and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=122.78s)]
*  personal to these UAPs. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=128.84s)]
*  So that suggests there have been adverse medical effects that American servicemen have been [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=131.24s)]
*  hurt by proximity to these objects? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=135.52s)]
*  Yeah, it actually suggests two things. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=139.2s)]
*  It suggests that, what you just said, that pilots may have actually suffered medical [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=142.4s)]
*  consequences adversely, but also that there is recovered material and that recovered material [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=146.6s)]
*  may be in the possession of the U.S. government. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  So does anybody that you're aware of in the Pentagon believe, sincerely believe that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=156.34s)]
*  these objects are part of the Russian or Chinese military or that they're foreign military aircraft? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=161.22s)]
*  I mean, honestly, if you were to ask them off the record, no, I think the consensus [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=170.02s)]
*  that this isn't Russian or Chinese technology. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=173.82s)]
*  Of course, you still have to keep that door open just to crack. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=176.46s)]
*  And I think it helps have the conversation, helps socialize it initially to, especially [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=180.56s)]
*  some folks who are just now actually hearing about this for the very first time, as crazy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  as it sounds, there are still people when you say, hey, have you heard about the UAP [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=189.94s)]
*  issue that we're encountering off the coast of California or over in the Middle East? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=193.86s)]
*  They're saying, no, what are you talking about? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=198.66s)]
*  So unfortunately, you still have to keep that part of the conversation open. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  But I think the general consensus is that we are dealing with something else. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=204.02s)]
*  Yeah, something else. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=207.02s)]
*  I mean, why is this not the biggest story ever of our lifetimes? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=208.38s)]
*  And of course it is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=211.74s)]
*  Lou Elizondo, thank you so much for all your efforts on this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=213.7s)]
*  Always my pleasure. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIz9TQWEyVQ&t=216.58s)]
