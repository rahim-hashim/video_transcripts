# Biden almost immediately politicizes response to Texas shooting
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc)
*  It does seem like the span between tragedy coming across the iPhone and partisan response [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=0.0s)]
*  is getting down to mere seconds. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I mean, this is the second time in, I think, seven days that I've been on your show, both [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=9.6s)]
*  of which have had incredibly heinous and horrific tragedies immediately followed by naked exploitation [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  of the dead bodies before anything is known about the people involved, including the killer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=25.72s)]
*  I was watching Joe Biden. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=33.32s)]
*  I empathize so much with what Will said that at the beginning of his speech, I was really [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=34.6s)]
*  hoping that he would strike exactly that note as somebody who has twice had to bury a child. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  He could really empathize with in a unique way with how uniquely heinous it is. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=45.08s)]
*  He could talk about the spirituality of our society and the need to unite on what obviously [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=50.4s)]
*  everyone no matter what your partisan perspective is reacts in the same way when seeing this [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=56.92s)]
*  sort of thing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=61.56s)]
*  And he spent about six seconds doing that and then immediately did a detour to figure [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=62.6s)]
*  out how he could squeeze and exploit the situation for partisan advantage. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=67.88s)]
*  It was so grotesque and unsurprising, but also really disappointing to watch. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=73.52s)]
*  And as God watches, speaking for myself, I would have praised Joe Biden if he had kept [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=79.84s)]
*  to the first part of that speech. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  I agree with you completely. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden has lost two children. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  Not many people can say that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=88.16s)]
*  He knows what it feels like. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=89.28s)]
*  I would listen carefully to him and I would feel deeply grateful if he used this moment [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=90.52s)]
*  to unite the country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=95.28s)]
*  We all are united in our grief as we watch children die. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=96.92s)]
*  Why not do that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think that the obsession that people who are doing politics full time have with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=104.24s)]
*  seeing the war, the world through this prism of partisan warfare is so consuming that it [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=112.0s)]
*  basically drains their entire soul so that nothing is left but this kind of immediate [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=117.36s)]
*  need to use every situation no matter how tragic to gain some kind of an advantage. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=123.36s)]
*  Look, Joe Biden is a politician. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=130.12s)]
*  He's in public policy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=132.24s)]
*  There are public policy aspects to events like this or the one in Buffalo. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=133.8s)]
*  So if you want to talk about that, that's fine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=137.68s)]
*  Wait a little bit of time, not just so the emotions can be processed, but so that just [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  basic facts are known about who this person is, what motivated them, what role guns had [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=144.8s)]
*  in terms of gun control laws or anything else you want to talk about. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=151.0s)]
*  They don't wait at all because they want to exploit those emotions that they could be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=154.02s)]
*  using to unite people to instead work them to their own advantage. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=158.34s)]
*  It's so ghoulish and grotesque to watch. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=162.02s)]
*  It really is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=164.62s)]
*  People have died and we owe them the respect of restraint. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=166.1s)]
*  That's how I feel about all death. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=170.3s)]
*  And I know you agree. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=171.62s)]
*  This stuff just drains people's humanity and it's just awful. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=173.02s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald, thank you for your description of that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=175.38s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=178.18s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEMsQMrLTc&t=179.78s)]
