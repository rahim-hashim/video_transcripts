# Doctor warns Tucker about hiring surgeons based on skin color, not skill
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw)
*  So equity, a poorly defined idea, has taken over and completely changed huge parts of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=0.0s)]
*  Banking, air travel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=7.72s)]
*  You don't want equity in medicine, do you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=10.24s)]
*  Particularly in surgery. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's there now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=12.96s)]
*  The American College of Surgeons has just declared itself to be a tool of white supremacy, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  suggesting that surgery itself may be racist. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=18.68s)]
*  They say that patients should have their surgeries done by doctors from their racial group, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=21.32s)]
*  as it was done during Jim Crow. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=26.48s)]
*  What should we think of this? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=28.52s)]
*  Well, Dr. Richard Beauschart is a surgeon. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=29.4s)]
*  He practices at Beauschart in MARSIC, Plastic Surgery Associates, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=31.56s)]
*  and he has a really thoughtful op-ed in The Wall Street Journal describing what's happening. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=34.8s)]
*  Doctor, thank you for coming on tonight, for being willing to do this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=40.4s)]
*  So why should we be concerned by these ideas entering medicine? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=43.6s)]
*  Tucker, thank you so much for having me on the show. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  I'm sitting here and I'm a little bit in disbelief that I'm even here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=53.92s)]
*  Don't take this incorrectly or wrongly, but I almost wish I didn't have to be. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=58.0s)]
*  Well, I agree. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=61.88s)]
*  I'm a plastic surgeon, once also board certified by the American Board of General Surgery, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=62.72s)]
*  and I've been practicing for over 33 years. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=68.76s)]
*  Last year, I was banned for life from access to members of the American College of Surgeons [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=73.08s)]
*  on their online discussion forums. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=79.16s)]
*  The ACS, for people that don't know, is the largest organization and also the oldest in the world. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=82.08s)]
*  Representing surgeons and also surgical patients. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  The mission of the ACS, which was written into their initial mission statement to serve [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=91.76s)]
*  all with skill and trust, has since been changed. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=97.12s)]
*  They were supposed to be promoting excellence in surgery and supporting surgeons and their patients. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=102.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, this is no longer true. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=107.48s)]
*  My ban occurred because two years ago, I noticed that there was a direction of the ACS to try [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=111.28s)]
*  to jump onto this systemic racism bandwagon that seems to be very popular these days. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=119.96s)]
*  The ACS leadership went to war against itself. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=127.6s)]
*  It declared the ACS, the American College of Surgeons, to be structurally racist. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=132.32s)]
*  It also went on to say that surgeons are racists, and even the practice of surgery is racist. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=137.04s)]
*  What this did is it produced a type of messaging that now states that, as you clearly put, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  it's best if patients are treated by surgeons of their own race. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=150.88s)]
*  Tucker, let me ask you a question. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=154.64s)]
*  If you are looking for a surgeon for yourself and a loved one, or a loved one, what are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=158.12s)]
*  you looking for in a surgeon? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=163.28s)]
*  Skill. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=166.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=167.2s)]
*  Skill, absolutely. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=168.2s)]
*  What about trust? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=172.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=173.0s)]
*  I would say that after skill, probably the single most important thing that goes into [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=174.0s)]
*  providing good medicine is trust. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=182.56s)]
*  A patient has to trust that a surgeon is not only competent and skilled, but also has their [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=184.0s)]
*  best interests at heart and will do the best for them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  A surgeon, on the other hand, has to also trust the patient, that they will understand [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=192.28s)]
*  that the surgeon is doing his or her best. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=197.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=199.88s)]
*  Dr. Boeser, I wish we had more time. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=200.88s)]
*  I hope you'll come back for a much longer conversation, because I think this matters [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=204.88s)]
*  more than almost anything else. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=208.04s)]
*  I appreciate your bravery coming on tonight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGITXkkFamw&t=209.36s)]
