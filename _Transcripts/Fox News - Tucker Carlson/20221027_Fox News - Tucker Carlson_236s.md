# New Canadian law would allow minors to be euthanized without parental consent
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog)
*  So Margaret Marsilla is a mother [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=0.0s)]
*  who lives outside Toronto, Canada. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=1.76s)]
*  She's got a 23 year old son [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=3.2600000000000002s)]
*  who suffers from depression and diabetes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=4.86s)]
*  Also, he doesn't have a girlfriend. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  On that basis alone, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=8.98s)]
*  doctors have just approved her son's assisted suicide. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  A doctor called Joshua Tepper signed off on it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  to kill the boy because he's sad [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  and doesn't have a girlfriend. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=23.02s)]
*  We know this because of the sub-stack common sense. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=24.28s)]
*  You can read the details and you should. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=26.5s)]
*  They're shocking. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=28.84s)]
*  This is about to become a lot more common in Canada [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  as a way of cutting down on healthcare costs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=32.52s)]
*  By March, new law in Canada is expected to allow children [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=35.04s)]
*  to be killed by doctors, by state doctors, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=38.44s)]
*  without the approval of their parents. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=41.34s)]
*  This seems like a very big change in Western civilization. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=44.0s)]
*  Charles Kamasie is a professor [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=46.96s)]
*  at Creighton School of Medicine. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=48.08s)]
*  He's the author of Losing Our Dignity. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=50.52s)]
*  I sure appreciate your coming on to assess this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=54.08s)]
*  We've had this conversation multiple times [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=55.88s)]
*  and each time we do, we reach a new and more terrifying load. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=57.52s)]
*  Doctors killing kids without telling their parents [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=61.1s)]
*  because the kids are depressed? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=64.56s)]
*  Let's see if I have the laundry list right, Tucker, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  at this point. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  We've got kids now are what they call mature minors. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=72.58s)]
*  We've got the homeless. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  We talked about that last time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=76.78s)]
*  The poor, the disabled, those with chronic pain. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=78.48s)]
*  And then right before coming on, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=82.06s)]
*  I researched the physicians group in Quebec [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=83.58000000000001s)]
*  that wants to kill newborn infants. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=85.54s)]
*  That's what's coming next. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=88.16s)]
*  The Toronto Star, Tucker, a very liberal paper in Canada, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=89.28s)]
*  called this Hunger Games Social Darwinism. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=93.16s)]
*  This is what happens, Tucker, when autonomy just goes nuts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=96.72s)]
*  I mean, you hate to, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=101.9s)]
*  and I really try never to invoke the Nazis [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  because, you know, for many reasons, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=105.76s)]
*  but they are famous for doing this exact thing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=109.14s)]
*  Use doctors to murder the weakest in your society. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=112.2s)]
*  And I thought that doctors kind of agreed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=115.38s)]
*  after the Second World War not to do things like this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you would think, and I'm the same way. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=122.0s)]
*  I think we should be very, very hesitant [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=123.6s)]
*  to use those arguments. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  But at a certain point, Tucker, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=126.92s)]
*  if the shoe fits, Canada has to wear it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=128.88s)]
*  Now the question is, can we stop this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=131.62s)]
*  from coming to the United States? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=133.82s)]
*  It hasn't got here yet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=135.62s)]
*  And I think we can. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=136.56s)]
*  For instance, New York, Connecticut, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=137.4s)]
*  even deep blue states like that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=139.12s)]
*  have not legalized even assisted suicide yet. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  And so what we need to do, Tucker, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=143.66s)]
*  and all your listeners need to do this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  is support in whatever way you can healthcare [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  that is about caring, not killing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=149.5s)]
*  In fact, there is a coalition of people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  There's a coalition of people coming up [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  with a brand new medical school, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=155.7s)]
*  the Padre Pio School of Medicine in 2026, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=157.26s)]
*  that is going to do this very clearly, very ably. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=160.1s)]
*  And if others would like to join a coalition of people [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  who are doing this, I urge them to send me a message [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=166.1s)]
*  through my website, charleskimosy.com or through Twitter, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  because we have to get off the couch [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=171.42s)]
*  and do something about this for those of us [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=173.0s)]
*  that see the writing on the wall here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=174.6s)]
*  Shouldn't the American Medical Association [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  weigh in and just say unequivocally, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=178.56s)]
*  doctors in the United States don't get to kill children [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=180.12s)]
*  just because children are depressed. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=183.12s)]
*  A doctor's job is to help people make them better, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=185.04s)]
*  not to kill them, give up on them when they're kids. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=187.04s)]
*  Well, as I wrote at length in Losing Our Dignity, Tucker, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  we have a very, very different healthcare system [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  than we had even 20 or 30 years ago. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=196.76s)]
*  It is hyper secularized. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=199.0s)]
*  It is often based on cost benefit analysis, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=201.48s)]
*  even something called quality adjusted life years, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=203.82s)]
*  which is basically ableism. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=206.42s)]
*  We had a lot of talk about ableism [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=208.26s)]
*  over the last couple of days. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=209.78s)]
*  This is ableism right here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=210.7s)]
*  And it's no accident that the disability rights groups [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=212.89999999999998s)]
*  are our biggest allies in this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  We should continue to employ them as again, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=216.72s)]
*  we get up off the couch here and fight. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=218.82s)]
*  Yeah, amen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=221.1s)]
*  Get off the couch and fight. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=221.94s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=222.94s)]
*  Professor Charles Kamasie, thank you as always. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=223.78s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4MURUeLog&t=226.29999999999998s)]
