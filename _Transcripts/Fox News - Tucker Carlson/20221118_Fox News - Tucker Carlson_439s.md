# Tucker Carlson: All Antifa has to do to end free speech is send some tweets
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=0.0s)]
*  Josh Denny is a comedian. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=2.6s)]
*  You may have heard of him. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=4.0s)]
*  He used to work for the Food Network. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=4.8s)]
*  He's also pro-life, personally willing to say so out loud. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Earlier this month, Denny was preparing to host a comedy show in Rutherford, New Jersey. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=10.6s)]
*  That's about half an hour outside of New York. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=14.9s)]
*  But just minutes after the show was announced, Antifa, violent radical group, decided to shut it down. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=17.1s)]
*  Hundreds of Antifa affiliated Twitter accounts started bombarding the venue [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=24.5s)]
*  called the Williams Center. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=29.5s)]
*  They also went after the chief of police of Rutherford, a man called John Russo, and they threatened violence. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=31.0s)]
*  Now, at that point, a chief of police who wanted to defend the Constitution, his solemn duty, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=36.5s)]
*  would have pushed back and affirmed the sacred right of free expression of every American. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=41.8s)]
*  But that's not what Chief Russo did. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=46.7s)]
*  Instead, he caved to the demands of the mob. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=48.5s)]
*  He warned the venue that the venue might face civil liability if they let free speech continue, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=51.8s)]
*  if they allowed the show to go on. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=58.8s)]
*  Then he said he would shut down the show on, quote, public safety grounds. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  So ultimately, the Williams Center had no choice and canceled the show. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=64.8s)]
*  In the end, the only people who showed up at the Williams Center that night were several police officers, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=69.1s)]
*  and they were there to make sure there was no comedy taking place, none at all. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=73.8s)]
*  Then, to add insult to injury, the next morning, the mayor of Rutherford, New Jersey, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=78.1s)]
*  Frank Nunziato, bragged about what the city had done. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=82.2s)]
*  He said it was his decision to use the power of the state to cut down comedy, quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=86.1s)]
*  unbeknownst to the borough, Nunziato wrote, an event was planned for this evening at the Williams Center, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  news of which quickly circulated through social media. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=96.3s)]
*  Online intelligence led the police department to believe that the event had the potential for concentrate confrontation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=99.0s)]
*  Therefore, Nunziato said, quote, after discussions with the owner, the event has been canceled. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  Now, notice the blame shifting here, the potential for confrontation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=111.69999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't the comedian who was going to confront or threaten anyone with violence. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  It was the radical left-wing group Antifa, but it was the comedian who was punished. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=120.6s)]
*  This is not the first time Josh Denny has experienced this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=126.8s)]
*  It's happened four times in just the past few weeks. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=130.0s)]
*  Shows canceled because of threats from the left. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=133.4s)]
*  Two shows were canceled in Chicago, another two in New York, and every time the same pattern. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=136.0s)]
*  Denny would schedule a comedy show that a huge amount of Antifa affiliated Twitter accounts [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=141.5s)]
*  intimidated the venue and local officials who collapsed under the pressure and shut it down. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=146.5s)]
*  Denny can no longer speak. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=153.3s)]
*  At this point, the only way he can host a show north of the Mason-Dixon line is to deliver cryptic instructions [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=155.4s)]
*  to his fans about where to meet secretly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=160.6s)]
*  Like a speakeasy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=164.2s)]
*  Otherwise, if he doesn't do this, all Antifa has to do to end free speech is send some tweets. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=165.9s)]
*  And then weak leaders capitulate immediately. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=172.0s)]
*  Josh Denny is not the only performer being targeted, and it's not just comedians. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=175.4s)]
*  This, of course, is part of a much larger campaign to end free speech in the United States, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=180.1s)]
*  a country whose civic religion was free speech just a few years ago. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=184.8s)]
*  This is a huge change and an ominous one. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=189.5s)]
*  Anyone who tells you you can't say what you truly believe is a totalitarian. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=192.4s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=196.8s)]
*  It's not about sensitivity. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  It's about controlling you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=199.5s)]
*  It's totalitarian. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=201.0s)]
*  We're going to start tonight with what's happening to comedians because free society requires comedians. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  Comedy is the way we tell the truth. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  The presence of comedians in a society means that you get to mock the people in charge very quickly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  And it's not an accident. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=220.8s)]
*  We're running out of comedians. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=222.0s)]
*  Only rote. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  Comedy is tolerated now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=227.0s)]
*  And that's another way of saying no comedy is tolerated now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk pointed this out a few months ago in an interview with the satire site, the Babylon B. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  And then you realize that's like, wait a second is a comedy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=236.9s)]
*  Is a comedy getting at an essential truth or trying to or is there is there a propaganda element? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=240.5s)]
*  Or is it trying to push you in a particular direction or getting getting to an essential truth that is humorous? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=247.4s)]
*  And when it stops trying to get to an essential truth that that is that is humorous, then, you know, it's just not that funny. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, after that interview, Twitter, as if to prove it has no sense of humor at all, banned the Babylon B. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=262.1s)]
*  Their crime, they made fun of the administration's fake trans admiral, that guy in a dress they're calling female. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=268.8s)]
*  We all know what Elon Musk did next. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=275.8s)]
*  He bought Twitter. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=277.5s)]
*  In a moment, we'll speak to the CEO of the Babylon B. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=278.7s)]
*  About what Musk must do to restore free speech to this country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=281.1s)]
*  What is clear at this point is that after Elon Musk fired half of Twitter's employees, Twitter got better. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=286.3s)]
*  Why? Because they were the censors. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=292.5s)]
*  And Twitter isn't the only company, many of whose employees work effectively as censors to shut down your freedom to say what you think. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=296.3s)]
*  Outside Netflix headquarters last year, protesters, some of the Netflix employees, gathered to demand the censorship of Dave Chappelle. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=303.5s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=310.9s)]
*  It's OK to laugh, but you're sparking hate conversation. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=319.9s)]
*  So what you had at Netflix is what you also had at Twitter. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=333.9s)]
*  And it's the same phenomenon that's canceling comedians all over the country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=347.29999999999995s)]
*  A small group of politically inflamed, highly motivated extremists who prevent the majority from saying what it thinks. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=350.9s)]
*  Another word for that is tyranny. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's everywhere. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=362.6s)]
*  One of the few people in Hollywood willing to fight back against this and say what he really thinks is Adam Carolla, a longtime comedian who has stayed true and therefore funny. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=364.0s)]
*  And he mocked the people you just saw as exactly what they are. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=375.6s)]
*  Humorless babies. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  I need to explain to the people at Netflix, which is an interesting. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=381.0s)]
*  Another interesting dynamic is your job isn't that important and it doesn't really change hearts and minds. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  I think people have this thing where it's like Dave Chappelle is going to mobilize this group of our society, which never really seems to be mobilized like his words. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=394.0s)]
*  His words hurt and his words are going to cause X, Y, and Z. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=405.7s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=411.2s)]
*  He's a comedian. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=412.5s)]
*  He gets to say what he wants and then he gets paid and you get paid and that's called entertainment. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=413.3s)]
*  He's a comedian. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  He gets to say what he wants. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=422.3s)]
*  That's no longer the rule in a lot of places. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=424.2s)]
*  But Adam Crowell lives by that rule still. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWF3euOwRpY&t=427.7s)]
