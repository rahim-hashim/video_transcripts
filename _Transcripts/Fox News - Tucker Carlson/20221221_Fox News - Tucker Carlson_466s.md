# Tucker presses Texas governor over commitment to secure border as Biden fails to
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I)
*  So we know why the administration is doing this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=0.0s)]
*  They're trying to change the population of the United States, and it's absolutely working [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=2.0s)]
*  better than anyone ever imagined. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=5.4s)]
*  But for, well, really two years now, we've asked, why is Texas allowing this? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=7.92s)]
*  Don't mess with Texas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=11.64s)]
*  Well, Texas is being messed with in a very big way. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=12.64s)]
*  And the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, just won re-election by opposing open borders. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=14.8s)]
*  Last November, he said he would deploy a total of 10,000 National Guard troops to the border [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=19.88s)]
*  to fix the problem and keep foreign nationals out because we have laws in this country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=24.2s)]
*  But in fact, the actual number of deployed troops was nowhere near that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=29.619999999999997s)]
*  It was about 5,000, according to the Texas Tribune. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=32.22s)]
*  Keep in mind, Texas National Guard has about 20,000 troops. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=34.62s)]
*  So we've asked maybe 15 times in the air, where are the soldiers to stop this and save [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=38.98s)]
*  the rest of our country? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=43.96s)]
*  On Tuesday, Greg Abbott did deploy a small number of National Guard members and state [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=47.099999999999994s)]
*  troopers to Rio Grande. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=50.58s)]
*  They formed a line. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=51.58s)]
*  They blocked dozens of migrants from surrendering to Border Patrol agents on the other side. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=52.82s)]
*  It worked. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=56.56s)]
*  The Border Patrol stayed behind the National Guard. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=58.1s)]
*  They couldn't process the migrants and release them into the United States. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=60.06s)]
*  So the truth is, Greg Abbott is a governor of one of our most important states, maybe [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=64.18s)]
*  the most important state, actually. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=69.02s)]
*  He's commander in chief of his state's military forces. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=70.54s)]
*  He could order the National Guard to the entire border right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=72.68s)]
*  And so why hasn't he? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=76.58s)]
*  So again, we've needled Greg Abbott countless times on the show and asked why. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=77.58s)]
*  And tonight, he's agreed to come on and explain. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=82.8s)]
*  And we're grateful for that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  Greg Abbott, thank you very much for coming on. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=86.02s)]
*  So just a very clear question. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  Why two years ago not say, I'm the governor of Texas. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  They're messing with Texas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=94.5s)]
*  I have a military foresight command. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=95.82s)]
*  It's called the National Guard. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=97.38s)]
*  We're going to block the border and save the country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=98.38s)]
*  Why didn't you do that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=100.46s)]
*  Why aren't you doing that now? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=101.46s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=102.46s)]
*  Tucker, I'll fully answer your question. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=103.46s)]
*  I do have to first, however, follow up on your earlier comments. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=105.1s)]
*  And that is when you look at the disaster on the border caused by Joe Biden, if Texas [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=108.86s)]
*  or just the border region got just one penny for every dollar spent in the Ukraine, we [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=114.06s)]
*  would be able to secure our border in that budget that Congress is about to pass. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=119.66s)]
*  They're giving money to Tunisia, but not to Texas. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  But to be clear, Tucker, about your direct question to me, there's a very easy and direct [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=128.1s)]
*  answer to it that you could find out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=132.62s)]
*  If you just go through my Twitter account, you'll see about five or six days a week, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=134.94s)]
*  we're posting images of what our National Guard is doing on the border. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  They didn't just begin in El Paso. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=143.5s)]
*  During the entire time that Joe Biden has been president, we've had thousands of National [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=146.3s)]
*  Guard on the border constantly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=151.86s)]
*  First, let's do the math based upon what you laid out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=153.82s)]
*  We actually don't have 19,000 National Guard at our disposal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=157.14s)]
*  The reason is because Texas leads all states in the country in having our National Guard [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=161.64s)]
*  deployed to regions across the entire world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=167.1s)]
*  So thousands of our National Guard are actually in other countries at this time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  Others have just returned from deployment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=175.58s)]
*  That said, over the course of the past two years during Operation Lone Star, we've had [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=177.96s)]
*  up to 10,000 National Guard deployed to the border doing in other regions what you saw [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=182.44s)]
*  them doing in El Paso. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=189.6s)]
*  What happened is they sign up for a one-year tour of duty service under Federal Department [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=191.66s)]
*  of Defense National Guard. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=197.9s)]
*  You do one year of active duty, you get five off. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=199.6s)]
*  We don't do that in Texas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=202.92s)]
*  But if you get a year, if you want, you get a year off. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=204.48s)]
*  However, we provided incentive, incentive pay to get people to stay on. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=208.16s)]
*  And so most people whose time has expired for their service, we actually are able to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  keep them on. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  We have thousands on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  And Bill Mollusian has shown on your TV show... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  Wait, let me add to that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  You just said something. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  ...those National Guards in action. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=227.96s)]
*  But still millions of foreign nationals, a lot with criminal records, all of them brought [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=228.96s)]
*  here by the Mexican drug cartels, have managed to come in to the tune of five million more. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=234.12s)]
*  We don't know, but millions and millions have come in through Texas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=239.2s)]
*  And so first you said a lot of your guardsmen are abroad. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=242.68s)]
*  Were you boasting about that? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  Or do you see that as perverse, that they would be helping other countries while not [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  present to defend our own? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=253.94s)]
*  I'm saying it as a fact that Texas has more of its guard that are called up to active [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=256.6s)]
*  duty service to serve the United States of America, which they are proud to do. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=263.68s)]
*  It's just a fact that... [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=268.32s)]
*  But wouldn't defending our own border from an invasion of millions of people be the single [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=269.32s)]
*  most important thing any American could do, particularly an American under arms whom you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=274.28s)]
*  control? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, those who are here in Texas, again, we've deployed up to 10,000 of them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=281.08s)]
*  The only reason why it would not be more, you've got to understand this also, and that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=287.52s)]
*  is there are some who retire every single month. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=291.0s)]
*  Some who are residing from service... [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=294.48s)]
*  No, I get it, but why don't you say, I'm the governor of Texas. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=295.48s)]
*  ...we're onboarding more every single month. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=298.48s)]
*  We're the greatest state in America. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=299.48s)]
*  Every Texan I know, including relatives of mine, they all think Texas is the best. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=301.64s)]
*  You're the governor. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=304.56s)]
*  Why don't you just say any person with military and law enforcement experience can join up. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=305.56s)]
*  We are starting our own force. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=310.04s)]
*  It's volunteer or just go to Midland, Dallas and Houston and get your donors to fund it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=311.36s)]
*  They would. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=315.8s)]
*  I'd send you money. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=316.8s)]
*  Everyone send you money. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=317.8s)]
*  And we're going to stop this on behalf of the state of Texas and the United States. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=318.8s)]
*  You could do that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=321.6s)]
*  The Biden people would back down in the face of that determination. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=322.6s)]
*  Why not? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=325.6s)]
*  Tucker, actually, we onboard new members every single month. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=326.6s)]
*  We do go through both that recruiting process as well as people signing up. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=332.72s)]
*  They onboard, they go through the training process, they get ready for deployment, and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=337.56s)]
*  then we deploy them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=341.44s)]
*  So we are constantly involved in adding to those who can serve us on the border. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=342.44s)]
*  And they get special training that is different what they have to do in the state of Texas [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=347.92s)]
*  compared to what they may do in Afghanistan. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=351.68s)]
*  Do you see this as a hair on fire emergency that's more important than anything they would [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=354.36s)]
*  have done in Afghanistan or Ukraine or any other country around the world? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=357.72s)]
*  Do you think this is the most important thing those guys could be doing? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=360.96s)]
*  Tucker, I have made that point to the United States Congress asking for more resources [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=365.72s)]
*  so that we can better defend our border. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  Knowing that the federal government is not defending our border, the only people capable [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=374.0s)]
*  of doing it would be Texas. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=377.36s)]
*  And what is Texas getting? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=379.48s)]
*  Nothing from the federal government. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=381.04s)]
*  But people would send you money if you started up a voluntary fund. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=382.64s)]
*  Send Greg Abbott money. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=386.44s)]
*  People would put you in their wills. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=387.88s)]
*  I mean, you're probably the president of the United States if you did that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=388.88s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=391.32s)]
*  And close the border, which you can do. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  You would be a folk hero sung about by future generations around the campfire. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=394.92s)]
*  I just think it's that simple. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=399.52s)]
*  Texas once again takes a stand against an invasion. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=401.52s)]
*  It's not the first time you've done it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=403.88s)]
*  So Tucker, let me tell you, we've done exactly that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=405.24s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=408.88s)]
*  I want you and your audience to know that today we begin putting up even more border [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=409.88s)]
*  wall. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=414.44s)]
*  Texas is the only state to build our own border wall. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=415.44s)]
*  My point is this. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=417.14s)]
*  We started a fund called borderwall.tx. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=418.41999999999996s)]
*  I can't remember the rest of it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=421.18s)]
*  We'll get it up for you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=426.38s)]
*  But anyway, we have a fund that people have given money to for Texas to continue building [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=427.38s)]
*  the border wall in addition to the billions of dollars. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=431.82s)]
*  Understand this, Tucker. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=434.18s)]
*  The state of Texas is coming out of our pocket to the tune of $4 billion every two years [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  for Texas to secure the border, not the federal government's money. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=439.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think the long-term costs of allowing this trump any cost in preventing it, just [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=445.18s)]
*  my view. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=450.06s)]
*  I appreciate you coming on tonight, Governor. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=451.06s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=452.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JelTJvjgv4I&t=453.06s)]
