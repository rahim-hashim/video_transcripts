# Tucker: Lawmakers are panicking over this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA)
*  So we've been covering this truck strike in Canada all week, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=0.0s)]
*  and at the end of the week, there are a couple of different images [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=4.24s)]
*  that kind of float around your head. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=7.04s)]
*  Picture the cops stealing the fuel from the freezing truckers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=10.0s)]
*  You picture the smiling truckers talking about love [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=13.6s)]
*  and waving Canadian flags. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=16.2s)]
*  Totally non-threatening. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=17.6s)]
*  But above all, you remember the hysteria of the people in charge [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  as they look out on this sea of working-class people [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=24.16s)]
*  who are really sick of being pushed around, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=26.48s)]
*  told what to inject into their bodies. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=28.32s)]
*  The people in charge are extremely upset about this, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=30.64s)]
*  hysterical, and it's hilarious. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=33.72s)]
*  You can just picture our transportation secretary, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  little Pete Buttigieg, jumping up and down, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=39.32s)]
*  shaking his little hands, screaming at the truck drivers, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  get off my bridge, you guys! [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=43.96s)]
*  Get off right now! [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=45.84s)]
*  And it's not just Mayor Pete. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=48.44s)]
*  You remember those angry tweets from that CNN contributor, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=50.44s)]
*  the lady who suggested we should slash their tires, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=53.0s)]
*  siphon their diesel fuel, throw them in prison. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=55.4s)]
*  They're all Torquemata now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=59.72s)]
*  They're talking like they're scary. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=61.84s)]
*  But keep in mind, these are not displays of power. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  This is not how confident people talk. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=67.08s)]
*  These are squeaks of impotence. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=69.36s)]
*  Our leaders are furious at the truckers [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=72.44s)]
*  because they know there's not a lot they can do [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=74.44s)]
*  about the truckers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=76.32s)]
*  They don't know anything about trucks, for one thing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=77.68s)]
*  How do you get a truck off a bridge, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=80.12s)]
*  especially when it has no fuel or tires? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=82.88s)]
*  They have no idea. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=85.32s)]
*  You just order someone to do it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=86.16s)]
*  It's kind of like Uber Eats. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=87.52s)]
*  Some guy trots out and removes the truck. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=89.24s)]
*  The problem is that the people who drive the trucks [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=92.96s)]
*  don't feel like following orders anymore. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  They're ignoring Pete Buttigieg. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  If you actually want to move a big rig, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  you need tow truck operators. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  And those tow truck operators know truckers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=104.63999999999999s)]
*  They know truckers aren't racists, they're not Nazis, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=107.8s)]
*  no matter how many times Joe Biden [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=110.28s)]
*  and Justin Trudeau claim they are. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  So some of them aren't inclined to help. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=114.6s)]
*  David Allen, for example, is the president of Gary's Towing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=117.0s)]
*  in Thunder Bay, Ontario. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=119.64s)]
*  He told Canadian media, quote, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=121.16s)]
*  we have all the capabilities on our tow trucks to do it, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=122.68s)]
*  but I don't think anyone would want to. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=125.28s)]
*  Another tow truck operator called Randy Wan said [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=127.76s)]
*  that even if tow truck operators wanted to help carry out [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=130.32s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg's orders, it would be very hard, quote, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=133.16s)]
*  in the end, the trucker's gonna say [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=137.4s)]
*  whether you're taking that truck away or not. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=139.28s)]
*  Now, there are technical reasons for this, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=142.2s)]
*  which apparently don't teach you McKinsey. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=143.96s)]
*  It turns out that trucks are heavy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  They have air brakes and steel belted tires. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=147.48s)]
*  Some of the truckers remove their tires completely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=150.92s)]
*  So what now? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=153.6s)]
*  Now is when you start to panic and they definitely are. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=155.4s)]
*  This afternoon, the prime minister of Canada, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=158.6s)]
*  who clearly is Fidel Castro's illegitimate son, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=160.88s)]
*  came out from hiding to threaten the protesters directly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=163.76s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=166.8s)]
*  If you joined the protests because you're tired of COVID, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  you now need to understand that you are breaking laws. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  The consequences are becoming more and more severe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=178.2s)]
*  You don't want to end up losing your license, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=183.16s)]
*  end up with a criminal record, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  which will impact your job, your livelihood, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=187.72s)]
*  even your ability to travel internationally, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=192.0s)]
*  including to the US. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=194.2s)]
*  You could be breaking laws. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=196.24s)]
*  That was the funniest part. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  These are people who literally don't care about the law at all. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=198.84s)]
*  They believe they make the law. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=201.0s)]
*  This is the prime minister who ordered the cops [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=203.52s)]
*  to steal people's fuel. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=206.24s)]
*  There's no law that says you can't have fuel in Ottawa. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=208.16s)]
*  He just made that up. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  Now he's lecturing them about the law. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=211.72s)]
*  And Joe Biden, who is violating federal law [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=213.8s)]
*  on the grand scale every day [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=216.28s)]
*  by importing 2 million people illegally without your consent, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=218.08s)]
*  he's upset about the law. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=221.44s)]
*  Justin Trudeau is so upset [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=223.44s)]
*  that he's threatening the trucker's children. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=224.4s)]
*  It's time to go home, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=226.84s)]
*  especially if you have your kids with you, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=228.36s)]
*  Trudeau said. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=230.16s)]
*  Wouldn't want something to happen to them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=231.0s)]
*  Trudeau also attacked the protesters for closing the border. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=233.08s)]
*  Only Justin Trudeau is allowed to do that, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  which he has done for more than a year. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=238.12s)]
*  So what are we watching here? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=241.36s)]
*  It's more than hypocrisy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  What we're watching is panic. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=245.16s)]
*  Justin Trudeau knows that nobody joined the protest [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=248.12s)]
*  because they're tired of COVID. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=250.16s)]
*  They're tired of tyranny. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=252.52s)]
*  They're tired of being told to inject something [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=255.0s)]
*  into their bodies that they don't want, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=257.04s)]
*  whose long-term effects cannot be known, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=258.92s)]
*  sold by companies that are protected, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=261.8s)]
*  that have immunity from public recourse. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=264.04s)]
*  We also know that what they told us to do didn't work. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=268.68s)]
*  The lockdowns didn't work. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=273.16s)]
*  Johns Hopkins came out and said it the other day. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=274.92s)]
*  Pretty conclusive. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=277.12s)]
*  That's what people are mad about. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  They want their freedom back. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  They're not tired of the virus. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=282.16s)]
*  They're tired of the leaders who use the virus [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  to give themselves more power. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  And they're still doing it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  Here's Ontario's premier, Doug Ford. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=288.92s)]
*  He announced today that instead of lifting [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=290.8s)]
*  his province's useless mandates, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=292.36s)]
*  he's going to steal the truckers' money, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=294.16s)]
*  fine them, and then send them to jail. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=296.0s)]
*  There will be consequences for these actions. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=298.68s)]
*  And they will be severe. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=302.6s)]
*  We've already started by going after the money funding [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=305.56s)]
*  the illegal occupation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=308.6s)]
*  Yesterday, an Ontario court granted our request [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=311.0s)]
*  to freeze the funds from give-send-go for the convoy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=314.68s)]
*  Fines for noncompliance will be severe [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=320.52s)]
*  with a maximum penalty of $100,000 [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=324.12s)]
*  and up to a year imprisonment. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=328.28s)]
*  We will also provide additional authority [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  to consider taking away the personal [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=333.88s)]
*  and commercial licenses of anyone [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  who doesn't comply with these orders. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=338.68s)]
*  When you start making threats like that, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=342.12s)]
*  you've already lost. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  What you're showing is that you're impotent [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=345.76s)]
*  and that's why you're unreasonable. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=348.0s)]
*  That's why you're hysterical. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=349.76s)]
*  That's why you're waving your arms around, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=350.92s)]
*  telling people they're going to prison. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  When you start stealing things from people, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  outside the law, speaking of the law, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=356.2s)]
*  everybody knows you're weak. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  So keep in mind, the truckers raised $10 million [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=361.0s)]
*  on GoFundMe. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=363.24s)]
*  That's a California company, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=364.06s)]
*  but Canadian politicians had that effort shut down. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=365.2s)]
*  Then give-send-go, which is a Delaware company, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=368.56s)]
*  raised almost the same amount [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=370.72s)]
*  and Canadian politicians went after that money too. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=372.16s)]
*  The Attorney General of Ontario successfully got a court order [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=375.04s)]
*  to freeze access to the $8.4 million raised on give-send-go. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=377.48s)]
*  Those funds were going to an adopt-a-trucker [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=382.04s)]
*  fundraising campaign. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=384.0s)]
*  It was paying for, quote, housing, water, food, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=385.52s)]
*  accommodations and shuttle services [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=388.2s)]
*  for truck drivers in Ottawa. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=390.08s)]
*  But all of that money has just been stolen [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=391.68s)]
*  by the Canadian government. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=393.48s)]
*  It's been seized. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=394.32s)]
*  All of this is pushing people away [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=396.4s)]
*  from government-issued currencies [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  because they're in control of lunatics [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=400.84s)]
*  like the guy you just saw, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=402.52s)]
*  and they're moving toward cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=403.56s)]
*  Just like 18 wheelers on bridges, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  blockchain is pretty tough for the authorities to control. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  Therefore, here's how you know it's a threat. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  The crypto guys must be white supremacists. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  And lo and behold, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=416.28s)]
*  that's exactly what they're now telling us. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=417.12s)]
*  It's an avenue, not just to make a lot of money [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=419.47999999999996s)]
*  or lose a lot of money, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=422.56s)]
*  but it's also an avenue for money laundering, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=423.44s)]
*  and it's also a place where white supremacists, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  apparently, are taking options. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=429.76s)]
*  I mean, it's problematic at best in so many ways. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=431.76s)]
*  It's problematic at best. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=436.12s)]
*  How do people like that get on television? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=437.44s)]
*  There should be an IQ requirement. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=438.8s)]
*  But by putting dumb people in the anchor chair, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=441.32s)]
*  they're perfectly compliant to the people in charge. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=444.08s)]
*  Crypto is white supremacy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=446.72s)]
*  But the hysteria gives them away. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=448.84s)]
*  As a trucker called Danielle Searsall [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=451.2s)]
*  explained in Ottawa last night, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  these people are terrified. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  They're afraid of losing control. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  The blockade of the Windsor Bridge panicked them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=456.88s)]
*  They blocked the Ambassador Bridge. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  That's the busiest border crossing [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=463.36s)]
*  in between Canada and USA. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  The most trade goes to that port. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=469.76s)]
*  So it's hidden up good, you know? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=472.56s)]
*  So the downside of all of this [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=477.64s)]
*  is it's turning Canada into a legitimate police state. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  For real. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=481.56s)]
*  Here's one of Doug Ford's police officers [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=483.68s)]
*  harassing a woman at her home [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=485.64s)]
*  because of something she wrote on Facebook [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=488.08s)]
*  in support of the truckers. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=490.44s)]
*  It's one of the creepiest clips you're gonna see today. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=491.72s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=493.72s)]
*  This is just some information about peaceful protests. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=494.56s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=497.64s)]
*  Okay, so you saw something on my Facebook? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=498.48s)]
*  No, on the Facebook group. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=502.12s)]
*  So the Ontario Provincial Police [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=503.56s)]
*  are watching what people are doing on Facebook [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=507.08000000000004s)]
*  in different groups, whether or not they're commenting, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  liking, and you guys are now doing service calls [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=511.44s)]
*  to give people information about peaceful protests. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=515.08s)]
*  It's just a proactive measure [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=517.32s)]
*  to make sure you understand your rights [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=518.88s)]
*  about peaceful protesting. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=520.8s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=522.28s)]
*  It's so great. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=523.6s)]
*  In 2020, the Stasi are chirpy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=524.68s)]
*  We're here as a proactive measure [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=527.56s)]
*  to inform you of your rights, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=529.32s)]
*  not because we've been spying on your social media. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=530.48s)]
*  So to recap, donating to the truckers is criminal. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=533.92s)]
*  Saying anything positive about the truckers [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=536.68s)]
*  gets the police to show up at your house. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=538.44s)]
*  That's why truckers are the new QAnon, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=540.76s)]
*  Russia, white supremacist, extremist threat. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=542.48s)]
*  Our leaders in this country agree. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  In Michigan, Doppiel Gretchen Whitmer [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=546.68s)]
*  is plotting to attack them with bulldozers. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=548.56s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  Do police need to begin arresting people in the blockade? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=552.24s)]
*  You know, I'm not gonna weigh into how they proceed. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=557.04s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you right now, though, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=561.68s)]
*  they have to get it done. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=563.12s)]
*  And using whatever tool it takes [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=564.92s)]
*  to safely and swiftly end this [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=568.04s)]
*  is what we're calling on them to do. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=570.4s)]
*  Trucker-inspired protests in the US, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=572.04s)]
*  potentially in your state, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=574.92s)]
*  would you forcibly clear people? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=576.48s)]
*  Brianna, if people are breaking the law, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=580.16s)]
*  obviously we'll assess it at the time, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=583.4s)]
*  but we are working very closely with our federal partners [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=586.04s)]
*  and the state police. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=588.72s)]
*  The fact of the matter is we're gonna do everything we can [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=590.08s)]
*  to prevent that from happening in the first place. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=591.96s)]
*  Working closely with our federal partners [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=595.64s)]
*  is the human mask lady. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=597.24s)]
*  Keep in mind, they're not talking about ISIS. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=599.16s)]
*  These are truck drivers, the people who bring you food. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=601.08s)]
*  They're unarmed, they're waving Canadian flags [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=603.64s)]
*  and talking about love. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  A lot of them brought their kids. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  Should CNN's national security contributors, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=609.64s)]
*  the neoliberal politicians who are attacking them [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=612.0s)]
*  really weigh into this fight? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=614.84s)]
*  No, because they can't win it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=616.2s)]
*  One side is too sympathetic and the other is too loathsome. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=617.88s)]
*  But they can't help themselves. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=621.84s)]
*  They are so threatened by disobedience, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=622.96s)]
*  they rush forward with swords drawn. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E3S_vEzsA&t=624.72s)]
