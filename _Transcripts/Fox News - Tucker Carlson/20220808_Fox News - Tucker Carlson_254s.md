# Lara Trump: This should shake you to your core
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE)
*  Lara Trump, as promised, a member of the Trump family and former senior adviser to Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump, joins us now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=5.16s)]
*  Lara, thank you for being on the program with us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=7.2s)]
*  I will just start with this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=9.52s)]
*  Have you spoken to the former president? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=12.0s)]
*  How is he doing? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=14.24s)]
*  What is the attitude of the family? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=15.24s)]
*  I have spoken to my father-in-law. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=18.6s)]
*  And I got to tell you, you know, he's as shocked as anybody. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=20.84s)]
*  I think for someone and anyone, quite frankly, who loves this country and believes in America, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=23.76s)]
*  this should shake you to your core. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=29.92s)]
*  What has happened today? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=32.36s)]
*  This is a very clear demarcation in the history of America. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=33.96s)]
*  Never before, as many of your guests have already talked about, Will, have we seen something [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=38.32s)]
*  like this happen, where an unannounced raid by the FBI is conducted on a former president [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=43.28s)]
*  of the United States? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=49.36s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=51.28s)]
*  If this is what they're able to do to the former president of the United States, think [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=52.28s)]
*  to you, to anybody in America. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=57.12s)]
*  The bottom line here is that these documents that have been in question have been, everybody's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=60.68s)]
*  been cooperating. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  Everybody from my father-in-law's team has been cooperating with the FBI, with any authority [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=67.3s)]
*  that asked for anything up until now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=71.84s)]
*  And there was no need to make such a big scene to do something this insane, quite frankly, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  to a former president. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=81.28s)]
*  But I think everybody clearly knows, Will, what is going on here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=82.92s)]
*  This is about weaponizing the justice system, as it has been so many times in the past, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=86.92s)]
*  against somebody who you politically do not like. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=92.36s)]
*  They detest Donald Trump, not just on the Democrat side, but the general establishment, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=95.84s)]
*  because he's not one of them, because he doesn't play their game. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=101.36s)]
*  They are terrified he's going to announce any day that he's running for president in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=104.56s)]
*  2024. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  And this is a very convenient way to just throw a little more mud on Donald Trump, as [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=110.56s)]
*  though they haven't already done enough. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=115.36s)]
*  This is the same agency, don't forget, the FBI, who, you know, had falsified documents [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  to get FISA warrants to, you know, conduct this entire sham Russia hoax that the country [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=122.72s)]
*  had to deal with for two years, millions of taxpayer dollars in our time, that we'll never [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=128.92s)]
*  get back to find what? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=134.0s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=135.6s)]
*  They've been trying to shove January 6th down everybody's throat in an effort to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=136.92s)]
*  get people to care about that and think that's the most important thing in the world. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  That hasn't worked for them yet. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  So here they are, heading into a midterm and heading into a presidential election season [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  coming up, where they know they have no hope on the Democrat side. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=150.67999999999998s)]
*  They have nothing positive to show that they've done for the American people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  You try to take out a guy who hasn't even announced that he's running yet, but they're [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=159.48s)]
*  terrified of him on the Democrat side for sure. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=163.2s)]
*  And I'm going to say it again in the general establishment. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=166.72s)]
*  Laura, you've spoken to your father-in-law, therefore you have the most immediate information [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=169.88s)]
*  of anybody we've spoken with tonight. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  Does he know, do you know why his home was raided? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=177.96s)]
*  He believes it's the documents in question that, you know, everybody's been really upset [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=184.44s)]
*  about from the White House. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  Look, my father-in-law, as anybody knows who's been around him a lot, loves to save things [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=190.36s)]
*  like newspaper clippings, magazine clippings, photographs, documents that he had every [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=194.52s)]
*  authority will to take from the White House. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=199.96s)]
*  And, you know, again, he's been cooperating every single step of the way with the people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=203.16s)]
*  that have questioned any of this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=208.0s)]
*  And I know people have brought it up before, but, you know, look at Hillary Clinton, the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=210.32s)]
*  33,000 emails that she just deletes that are completely gone and nobody bats an eyelash [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=214.48s)]
*  about it. Donald Trump takes some documents that he had every right to take, that every [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=219.68s)]
*  president does, didn't take antiques, you know, like Hillary Clinton took out of the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=223.48s)]
*  White House and paintings, apparently. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=227.88s)]
*  But that is what he believes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's what, you know, I think is at the bottom of all this and the reason that they [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=231.88s)]
*  raided Mar-a-Lago, quite frankly. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  All right. All right. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  Always good to talk to you. Thank you for giving us that firsthand perspective from [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  Inside the Family tonight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Mj9pEz9FE&t=242.04s)]
