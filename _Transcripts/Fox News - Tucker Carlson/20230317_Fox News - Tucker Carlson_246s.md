# This is a 'ridiculous' claim from Hunter Biden's lawyers: Miranda Devine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8)
*  Well, the FBI doesn't seem to have made a lot of progress figuring out how the Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=0.0s)]
*  family made all that money from foreign governments and was it legal or not. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=6.88s)]
*  But Congressman James Comer, Jamie Comer of Kentucky, has been looking into it as a new [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=11.44s)]
*  committee chairman. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=15.96s)]
*  And he found that Hallie Biden, the widow of Bo Biden, Hunter Biden's ex-girlfriend, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=17.14s)]
*  received a $35,000 cut of a $3 million payout from China. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=21.88s)]
*  It was part of a deal that Hunter Biden made, associate of Hunter Biden made, with the Chinese [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=26.44s)]
*  state energy company. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=31.28s)]
*  Hunter Biden's legal team came out with a statement today and said, quote, Hunter is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=33.04s)]
*  a private citizen with every right to pursue his own business endeavors, joined several [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  business partners in seeking a joint venture with a privately owned, legitimate energy [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=40.94s)]
*  company in China. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  So that's his attorney's position. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=46.96s)]
*  Randi Devine is one of the world's experts on this question. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=49.64s)]
*  She is the author of the book Laptop from Hell, and she joins us now to assess. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=52.24s)]
*  Miranda, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=56.2s)]
*  So what do you think Jamie Comer is going to find here? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=58.28s)]
*  What do you think of Hunter Biden's attorney's statement? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=68.4s)]
*  Well, this clearly Hunter Biden's lawyers are trying to say that this money, these two [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=69.56s)]
*  tranches of $3 million that went to Rob Walker, a Hunter Biden associate, business associate [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=75.72s)]
*  and friend, was seed money, was sort of prepayment for future work to be done. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=83.0s)]
*  And that's ridiculous. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=89.4s)]
*  Tony Bobolinski has said and he was involved in these deals, Hunter Biden's former business [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=91.44s)]
*  partner. And there's ample evidence on the laptop to show that Hunter Biden and his business [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=98.12s)]
*  partners were doing work for this Chinese energy conglomerate for the last two years [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=103.44s)]
*  of Joe Biden's vice presidency. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  They were owed money and the money was not to be paid until after Joe Biden left office. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=111.84s)]
*  And so sure enough, here we are in February of 2017, just less than two months after Joe [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=118.28s)]
*  Biden's left office. And the first of these $3 million payments has come through to Rob [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=125.16s)]
*  Walker's bank account. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=130.88s)]
*  And then another one came a couple of weeks later. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  And within a few days, that money gets dispersed to, we know from James Comer today, to four [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=136.60000000000002s)]
*  immediate family members of Joe Biden, and that being his son Hunter, his brother Jim [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=145.88s)]
*  Biden, Hallie Biden, who's the widow of his late son, Bo, who at that stage had been having [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=150.96s)]
*  a relationship with Hunter for two years since her husband had died. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=158.88s)]
*  And then there's another fourth family member of the Bidens that James Comer and his oversight [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=163.72s)]
*  committee have not yet been able to find the identity of. It's just named as Biden. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=169.64s)]
*  But they are subpoenaing those bank records, that bank account, and presumably we'll find [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=175.64s)]
*  that pretty soon, probably early next week. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=181.04s)]
*  And you know, they're continuing on just following the money. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=184.0s)]
*  I think if as Hunter's lawyers and the White House is saying there's nothing untoward about [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  this, then why was this money so laboriously doled out over three months in small increments [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=195.0s)]
*  to various members of the family? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=202.84s)]
*  And why was it given to Hallie Biden, who was a primary school teacher? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=206.84s)]
*  And did they all pay tax on it? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=212.0s)]
*  And why was Rob Walker the middleman? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=213.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=218.24s)]
*  I mean, they didn't. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  It's not like they complained about a drag queen story hour. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=221.12s)]
*  So the FBI isn't actually interested, apparently, in finding out what happened. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=225.12s)]
*  But I hope all of those questions are answered by Mr. Comer's committee. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=229.0s)]
*  Rayner Vine, thank you for that update tonight. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1B4QdDRJl8&t=233.76000000000002s)]
