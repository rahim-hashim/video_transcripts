# Tucker: We need more facts in this story
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU)
*  When you work in cable news, you're responsible not just for your own behavior, but the behavior [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=0.0s)]
*  of your producers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  If one of them does something wrong, you've got to answer for it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  You've got to explain how the work environment you created made this impossible. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=9.0s)]
*  Now, we're not sure we're on board with this standard. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=13.0s)]
*  It seems a little broad, but we don't make the rules here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=15.9s)]
*  CNN makes the rules here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=18.16s)]
*  This is the rule they made, and every one of the TV business acts like it's federal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=20.1s)]
*  law. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=23.18s)]
*  Given that, it was interesting to see one of CNN's senior producers arrested for child [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=24.18s)]
*  molestation recently. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=28.8s)]
*  John Griffin is 44. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=30.44s)]
*  He's been for years a prominent member of the staff over at CNN. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=31.84s)]
*  Last week, he was arrested by authorities in Vermont for having sex with children. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=36.04s)]
*  Now, typically, you read all the ugly details on TV, but they're too ugly, so we're going [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=40.4s)]
*  to spare you them. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=44.8s)]
*  Suffice it to say, if these details are true, then this guy is awful and deserves to spend [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=45.8s)]
*  the rest of his life in prison. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=51.0s)]
*  We're not the jury here, but the charges are very serious. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=52.0s)]
*  In the meantime, here's our question. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  What kind of diseased work environment at CNN produced an accused child molester? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=58.64s)]
*  Now, that's an obvious question. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=64.56s)]
*  It's exactly the question CNN would ask of us, for example. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=66.28s)]
*  But somehow, CNN's tireless media critics, the eunuch and his bug-eyed accomplice, have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=70.66s)]
*  not said a word about it, which is weird. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=75.44s)]
*  Now, it's been reported that Griffin worked for a guy called John Avalon. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=77.8s)]
*  If you watch CNN, you may see Avalon occasionally. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=81.72s)]
*  He's the filling guy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=84.54s)]
*  He's the guy they call when the adults are on vacation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=85.54s)]
*  He shows up and tells you how scary QAnon is. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  So that's the John Avalon you see on TV. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=91.08s)]
*  But what's happening behind the scenes? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=93.12s)]
*  Did John Avalon know that his producer was molesting children? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=96.12s)]
*  Is he for that? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=99.42s)]
*  Is he against it? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=100.42s)]
*  Does he believe that the moral tone he set at work played any role in these alleged crimes [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=101.42s)]
*  against minors? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=106.84s)]
*  Now we called CNN for answers yesterday. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't tell us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=110.72s)]
*  Nor has Avalon issued any kind of statement about it, including on Twitter, where he lives [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=112.48s)]
*  pretty much all day. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=117.2s)]
*  That's pretty weird behavior for a quote, journalist, not adding facts to a story you're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=118.2s)]
*  involved in. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=122.68s)]
*  We are journalists. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=124.2s)]
*  We would like some more facts on this story, and hopefully we'll get them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_qe8Qpj3XU&t=125.2s)]
