# Tucker: When will Joe Biden stop talking about this?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  So much drama. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=3.6s)]
*  You can't say we're not learning a lot, though. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  And one topic we've learned a lot about over the last year is Russia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=7.04s)]
*  And the reason we've learned about it is because Russia is Joe Biden's number one favorite [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=11.4s)]
*  topic of conversation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=15.4s)]
*  Joe Biden can talk about Russia forever, meaning in his case, for up to four minutes at a time, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=16.92s)]
*  which at this stage is Joe Biden's version of a filibuster. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=22.56s)]
*  You may have asked yourself, when will Joe Biden ever stop talking about Russia? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=25.32s)]
*  Well, very soon, actually. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=29.68s)]
*  In fact, he seems to be losing his train of thought right now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=31.0s)]
*  But don't worry, he'll be back to it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=33.36s)]
*  Russia is a very comfortable topic for Joe Biden. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=35.88s)]
*  He enjoys talking about it much more than talking about, say, inflation or crime or [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=38.4s)]
*  fentanyl deaths or about how half the population of Haiti appears to be showing up in Florida [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=42.8s)]
*  in leaky boats. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=47.72s)]
*  Those subjects may interest you since you live in this country, but not Joe Biden. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=49.84s)]
*  Despite appearances, Biden doesn't actually live here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=53.28s)]
*  In his head, Joe Biden is floating high above the sea of Azov, swooping in over southeastern [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=56.12s)]
*  Ukraine like a Botox superhero just to make sure everything's OK with his little buddies, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=62.0s)]
*  the Ukrainians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=66.4s)]
*  Joe Biden's a protector that way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=67.4s)]
*  But he's also, at the same time, a scholar and a teacher, not a credentialed educator [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=69.08s)]
*  like the doctor he's married to. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=72.88s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't go to community college in Delaware for a doctorate in diversity studies. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=74.08s)]
*  He's just a civilian. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=78.24s)]
*  But Biden can still lecture with the best of him. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=79.56s)]
*  If you signed up for his Intro to Russia is Bad class this semester, you will not be [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=81.8s)]
*  disappointed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=85.88s)]
*  Professor Biden knows that material cold. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=86.88s)]
*  So what have we learned so far? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, first and foremost, Russia is bad. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=90.32s)]
*  That's the name of the course. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=92.56s)]
*  It's the entire syllabus, actually. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=93.56s)]
*  It may be the only fact you will come away with after months of heavy coursework. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=95.92s)]
*  Russia is bad. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  You learn that and you will ace the exam. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  Now to be clear, we're talking about Russia here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=103.96s)]
*  We're not talking about the Soviet Union. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=105.84s)]
*  There's a difference. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  And Joe Biden's been around long enough to know what that difference is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  He's seen it firsthand. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=111.16s)]
*  The Soviets wanted peace. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=112.56s)]
*  Joe Biden told us that repeatedly in the 70s and 80s. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=114.44s)]
*  Russia, by contrast, just wants war. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=117.24s)]
*  The Russians are warlike people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=120.44s)]
*  It's inherent. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Russians are driven by blood lust. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  They have tiny brains. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=124.28s)]
*  Their breath smells like herring. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=125.8s)]
*  They're always drunk, often on aftershave or household cleaning products. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=127.52s)]
*  On Sunday mornings, when good people are still asleep at home with their families, your average [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=131.48s)]
*  Russian will still be lurking through the dark streets, leering through bloodshot eyes, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  trying to subvert somebody else's democracy or conquer a peace-loving neighbor. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=140.4s)]
*  That's just who Russians are. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=144.36s)]
*  It's what they do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=145.68s)]
*  But if there's one thing you absolutely must know about Russia, if you're going to navigate [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=146.68s)]
*  this world, that thing is that on February 16, 2022, Vladimir Putin is going to invade [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  our closest ally in the world, Ukraine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  So write that down. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=159.08s)]
*  February 16, 2022, Ukraine invasion begins. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=160.16s)]
*  That's the day. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=164.44s)]
*  Joe Biden has been very clear about that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=165.44s)]
*  So have the intel agencies and of course their stenographers in the news media. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=167.24s)]
*  As Politico put it, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=171.2s)]
*  But this won't be your typical physical assault like the kind you've experienced on the New [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=181.76s)]
*  York City subway. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  According to Politico, this physical assault [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  So these aren't just gang members. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=194.83999999999997s)]
*  They're Russians. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  The Daily Mail confirmed Politico's reporting. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=198.2s)]
*  Putin has decided to invade Ukraine on Wednesday, read the headline. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=201.2s)]
*  Brits and Americans told to get out now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  That same day, the Mirror in London let us know they had seen Vladimir Putin's planning [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  documents and Operation Snuff Out Ukrainian Democracy was already in motion. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=213.0s)]
*  Quote, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  So February 16, 2022 was definitely the day the music was going to die in Ukraine. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  Everybody knew that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=230.4s)]
*  But weirdly, nobody thought to tell the president of Ukraine, who is an obedient puppet of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  Biden State Department you might think would have heard the news. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=237.52s)]
*  But no, he hadn't. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=240.08s)]
*  He was baffled by it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=241.08s)]
*  He said this, quote, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  That was President Zelensky. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=256.12s)]
*  Now keep in mind that in addition to being a puppet of the Biden administration, President [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=258.48s)]
*  Zelensky of Ukraine was also at one point a low-grade comic of some kind. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=261.92s)]
*  So he was kidding. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=266.08s)]
*  That was a joke. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=267.08s)]
*  But in the American news media, there are no jokes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=268.36s)]
*  Humor has been banned for several years now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=270.6s)]
*  In fact, at this point, you're more likely to hear a joke on a Russian news broadcast [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=272.28s)]
*  than on American television, which is pretty amazing if you think about it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=276.2s)]
*  Things have changed. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=279.0s)]
*  In any case, the readers of Teleprompter on our TV channels did not get this joke at all. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=280.0s)]
*  So here's the coverage they produced. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=287.08s)]
*  President Zelensky saying that his government has been told that February 16th will be the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=318.08s)]
*  day of a possible attack. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=325.88s)]
*  Today defiant Ukrainians celebrated a day of unity. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=327.76s)]
*  There had been reports and intelligence warnings that today, February 16th, might be the day [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=331.36s)]
*  of the invasion. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=336.12s)]
*  Of course, that's up to Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=337.12s)]
*  Will Ukraine be ready? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  Oh, if that was up to Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=341.96s)]
*  They didn't get it was a joke. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=346.64s)]
*  So it put us in a very weird position where suddenly we were being lectured on humor by [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=348.8s)]
*  Eastern Europeans. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=354.12s)]
*  Think about that for a minute. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  Zelensky's staff issued a statement explaining that actually he was kidding. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=358.96s)]
*  So some news outlets had to update their reporting, but they were clearly annoyed with Zelensky. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=362.5s)]
*  Quote, Ukrainian leader makes confusing joke about Russian invasion, harumphed New York [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=367.0s)]
*  magazine. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  But here's the funniest part of all. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=372.52s)]
*  There was no invasion. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=374.68s)]
*  February 16th, 2022 was yesterday. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=376.56s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=380.64s)]
*  Vladimir Putin did not invade Ukraine. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=381.88s)]
*  Now if Joe Biden noticed the lack of an invasion, he didn't acknowledge that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=385.08s)]
*  He didn't say a word. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=389.04s)]
*  Today he was back on television assuring us once again, the invasion is coming. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=390.72s)]
*  How high is the threat of a Russian invasion right now? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=395.72s)]
*  It's very high. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=399.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=400.12s)]
*  It's very high because they have not moved any of their troops out. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=402.0s)]
*  They've moved more troops in. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=406.44s)]
*  Number one, number two, we have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false flag [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=408.32s)]
*  operation to have an excuse to go in. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=414.52s)]
*  Every indication we have is they're prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=417.12s)]
*  Are you going to call Putin? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=423.32s)]
*  I'm not calling Putin. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=424.64s)]
*  I have no plans to call Putin right now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=425.64s)]
*  Do you think he made a final decision? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=427.64s)]
*  So here's a guy who's literally wearing a mask outside assuring us that he's sane and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=431.92s)]
*  on the ball enough to know when Putin is going to invade Ukraine. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=437.48s)]
*  But of course he's gotten it wrong. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=443.2s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=445.4s)]
*  Well, the most obvious explanation is the most, it's the most obvious one. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=446.4s)]
*  Dottering old Joe Biden, who even before he was senile was widely considered a moron in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=452.04s)]
*  has been played by Vladimir Putin, who may be evil, but definitely is not stupid. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=456.72s)]
*  If Putin bluffed an invasion of Ukraine to make Biden look ridiculous, it worked. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=462.12s)]
*  Maybe there was something else going on. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=468.0s)]
*  Maybe Putin still plans to invade Ukraine. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=469.36s)]
*  It's hard to know. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=471.44000000000005s)]
*  But as you just heard, Joe Biden doesn't know because he refuses to talk to the Russians. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=472.76000000000005s)]
*  The Russians are too immoral for Joe Biden. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  That's saying a lot, coming from a former credit card lobbyist who helped run America's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=480.0s)]
*  most corrupt state. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=483.56s)]
*  But according to Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin is not someone you can ever talk to because [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=486.0s)]
*  he put bounties on the lives of American troops in Afghanistan. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=490.64s)]
*  How does Joe Biden know that happened? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=495.32s)]
*  Well, he got it from the very same people who spent all last month telling us that Putin [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=496.8s)]
*  was going to invade Ukraine on February 16th. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=500.8s)]
*  Here they are. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=503.36s)]
*  A new report says that Russia offered Afghan militants bounties to kill U.S. soldiers. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=504.36s)]
*  The administration's non-reaction. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=511.04s)]
*  CNN, matching the reporting, cited a source asserting that the cash rewards did lead [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  to coalition casualties. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=518.56s)]
*  Not so long ago, in a land not so far away, there was a Republican party that would have [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=520.52s)]
*  confronted Russia for putting bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=525.72s)]
*  To say nothing of putting bounties on American troops. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=529.72s)]
*  It's unbelievable, Joy. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=532.72s)]
*  I mean, he has still yet to say anything as the president of the United States about bounties [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=534.88s)]
*  on American troops. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=540.48s)]
*  One of the most discredited people in the world weighing in with total certainty on [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=543.16s)]
*  the most important topics. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=547.7199999999999s)]
*  If you were to sum up the moment we're living in, that's how you'd describe it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  Everything they just told you turned out to be untrue. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=552.7199999999999s)]
*  They were lying. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  Why were they lying about that? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=555.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, of course, to keep us in Afghanistan forever. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=556.7199999999999s)]
*  Why would they want to do that, you ask? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=558.92s)]
*  We weren't achieving anything, obviously. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  The second we left, the Taliban took over. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=563.24s)]
*  It became one of the best armed militaries in the entire region. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=565.8s)]
*  So what we were doing wasn't working, but they didn't want us to leave. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=570.16s)]
*  In fact, they were willing to lie to keep us there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=572.5200000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=574.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, we don't have any special intel, but we're thinking maybe the defense industry, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  profligate campaign donors, may have had something to do with it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=581.08s)]
*  Here's Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut explaining that actually Ukraine needs a lot [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=584.36s)]
*  more lethal weapons from Raytheon. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=588.4000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=590.36s)]
*  I was so deeply impressed with how resolute and determined the people of Ukraine are. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=591.36s)]
*  They are courageous. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  They are steadfast. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  And they're going to fight in the streets, their neighborhoods, the fields, if we give [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=599.64s)]
*  them the arms that they need. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=602.88s)]
*  And that's why I've also urged the Javelin missiles and the Singer missiles to combat [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=604.4s)]
*  their tanks and their aircraft. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  So that guy who lied about his own war service is pretty excited at the thought of Ukrainians [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=613.0s)]
*  fighting and dying in the streets. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=617.92s)]
*  These people are so ghoulish. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  And of course, they're promoting war, not to maintain the democracy that is Ukraine. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=622.88s)]
*  Ukraine is not a democracy. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=628.64s)]
*  It has never been a democracy in its history, and it's not now. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=629.64s)]
*  It's a client state of the Biden administration. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=634.24s)]
*  It's a place in which opposition media and opposition political candidates are completely [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=636.88s)]
*  shut down by the government. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=642.68s)]
*  It's not a democracy at all. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=643.68s)]
*  And it's insulting, they would suggest, otherwise. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=645.28s)]
*  But people like that, and many people in Washington, are pushing Ukraine toward war. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=648.12s)]
*  So we're sending them weapons and then making it very easy for them to use them. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  They told us now for months that any preemptive attack by Ukraine actually isn't real. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=658.68s)]
*  If you see Ukraine using these weapons, no, says Tony Blinken. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=665.08s)]
*  That's not aggression. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=669.56s)]
*  It's a false flag attack by Russia. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=670.56s)]
*  Russia plans to manufacture a pretext for its attack. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=674.88s)]
*  This could be a violent event that Russia will bring on Ukraine or an outrageous accusation [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=679.24s)]
*  that Russia will level against the Ukrainian government. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=684.36s)]
*  We don't know exactly the form it will take. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=687.84s)]
*  It could be a fabricated so-called terrorist bombing inside Russia, the invented discovery [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=690.04s)]
*  of a mass grave, a staged drone strike against civilians, or a fake, even a real, attack [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=695.5s)]
*  using chemical weapons. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=703.66s)]
*  So they're going to use chemical weapons, but it won't actually be them. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=706.84s)]
*  It'll be those diabolical Russians, drunk on aftershave. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=711.12s)]
*  Once again, there is zero evidence that any of this is true. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=716.64s)]
*  This is clearly some sort of intel op that's being filtered through the State Department [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=720.9200000000001s)]
*  and the media. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=725.48s)]
*  But yet, for months now, they told us Russia is definitely going to manufacture a pretext [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=727.4s)]
*  for a Ukraine invasion. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=731.24s)]
*  So finally, a lone AP reporter bravely asked, how do you know this? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=733.08s)]
*  And they immediately accused him of working for Putin. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  He's pretty much the only reporter who asked a question like that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=742.2800000000001s)]
*  And there's a depressing irony to that. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=745.1600000000001s)]
*  Matt Taibbi put it very nicely this morning in a piece on Substack. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  Quote, a big reason we're supposed to be an improvement over Putin's Russia, Taibbi wrote, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  is that we don't use the news media as an instrument of information warfare. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=754.6800000000001s)]
*  At least Russian reporters don't have much choice in being inscripted for this duty. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=759.08s)]
*  What's the excuse of Westerners who broadcast CIA gibberish on command? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=763.36s)]
*  Well, that's a very good question. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=768.48s)]
*  And the answer is, they have no excuse. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMD0-yWrQ8&t=771.24s)]
