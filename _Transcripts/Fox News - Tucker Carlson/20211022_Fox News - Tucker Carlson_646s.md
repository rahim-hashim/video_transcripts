# Jesse Watters: Democrats just want a dictator
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 22, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jesse Waters and for Tucker, not many people were watching Joe Biden's town hall [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=7.72s)]
*  last night. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=12.36s)]
*  The ratings were absolutely terrible, which isn't surprising at all. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=13.36s)]
*  Joe Biden's not capable of thinking clearly and most Americans recognize that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=16.84s)]
*  So they watched football and Fox News instead. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=21.72s)]
*  But that raises an interesting question, which until recently no one has asked. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=24.68s)]
*  Given the obvious deterioration of Joe Biden's mind, he now struggles to form coherent sentences. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=29.56s)]
*  Why have this town hall at all? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=35.92s)]
*  Why not call another lit at 10 a.m. and send Joe Biden off to the farm in Delaware? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=38.72s)]
*  One of the few people who tuned in last night, a novelist named Walter Kern, offered a possible [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=44.4s)]
*  explanation. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=49.44s)]
*  Quote, I've never seen anything like this, Kern wrote. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=50.44s)]
*  At some level, it has to be intentional. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  No one was clamoring for a town hall. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=56.92s)]
*  Grave deterioration is being thrust in our face. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=59.56s)]
*  Cooper is racing through his question as though to keep from laughing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=63.04s)]
*  It feels like the work of enemy propagandists. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=67.72s)]
*  Kern made that observation in response to this clip from last night's town hall, which [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=71.16s)]
*  we promise we haven't edited in any way. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=75.12s)]
*  Just in terms of inflation, because you had told us at a town hall, I think it was in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=80.12s)]
*  July that the it was just near term inflation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=83.96s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal recently talked to like 67 financial experts who said that they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  they saw high inflation going all the way or deep into 2022. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=93.72s)]
*  Joe Biden just stands there for nearly 20 seconds with his hands locked in the nine [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=98.44s)]
*  o'clock and three o'clock position. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=102.88s)]
*  Watching that, it's hard not to wonder. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=106.0s)]
*  Did Joe Biden know where he was? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=107.72s)]
*  Did he think he was piloting one of those old Amtrak trains right there on stage? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=110.32s)]
*  Did he convince himself he was really back on the mean streets of Delaware, driving his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  67 stingray to a throwdown with corn pop aviators and metal chain and tow the road in Joe Biden's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  mind was obviously long and treacherous, hence the clenched grip. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  The moderator on the stage, as Walter Kern pointed out, tried his hardest not to notice [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=132.44s)]
*  any of this, but it was noticeable to everybody who watched the town hall last night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=137.56s)]
*  Joe Biden's handlers knew something like this would happen, and they sent him out there [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  anyway. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=148.12s)]
*  Things became so confusing for Joe Biden last night. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=149.32s)]
*  At one point, he literally stopped mid-sentence and asked and we're quoting, What am I doing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=151.72s)]
*  here? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  40% of all products coming into the United States of America on the West Coast go through [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Los Angeles and what am I doing here? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=164.8s)]
*  Long Beach? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=170.0s)]
*  Long Beach. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=171.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=172.0s)]
*  Obviously it's not Joe Biden's fault he's in mental decline, but the political opportunists [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=173.0s)]
*  who made Joe Biden president of the United States, people like Jill Biden and Susan Rice [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=177.24s)]
*  and so on, are responsible for this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=181.96s)]
*  They lied for years about Joe Biden's conditions so that they could obtain more power. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  Now that they have that power, they're making us aware who's really in charge. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  It's not Joe Biden. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=193.8s)]
*  The point of last night's town hall was to make that undeniable. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=195.5s)]
*  He doesn't have any comprehension of any of the problems this country's facing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=200.08s)]
*  Asked about the fact that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are entering this country [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=205.4s)]
*  unimpeded, for example, Joe Biden started lying uncontrollably. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  First, he claimed he's been to the border and knows it well. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  But there's no record Joe Biden's ever visited the southern border, not his president, not [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=218.72000000000003s)]
*  his vice president, not his senator and not as a citizen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=223.2s)]
*  Today, Fox's Peter Ducey asks Joe Biden's flack about that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  There's been reporting that he did drive through the border when he was on the campaign trail [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=235.2s)]
*  in 2008. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  And he is certainly familiar with the fact and it stuck with him with the fact that in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=241.76s)]
*  El Paso the border goes right through the center of town. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  So we looked into this in 2008, Joe Biden flew into El Paso and then drove to New Mexico [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=251.08s)]
*  for a political rally. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  He never visited the border. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=259.6s)]
*  He didn't even drive through it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=261.36s)]
*  If Joe Biden saw the border at all, it was in his rear view mirror. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  So this is just another lie. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  But even if you believe the lie, the White House's explanation still makes no sense. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=270.04s)]
*  They're saying Joe Biden drove through the border one time more than a decade ago on [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  his way to somewhere else. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=280.32s)]
*  According to the White House, that means he's an expert and he doesn't have any reason to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=282.68s)]
*  visit the border now that he's president of the United States. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=287.0s)]
*  This is so absurd that it's obvious no one in the White House really believes it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=290.66s)]
*  Again, they're rubbing this in our faces. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=296.04s)]
*  Joe Biden is not in control. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=299.04s)]
*  That's why none of these excuses make any sense. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=301.52s)]
*  Not a single one. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  At the town hall last night, Joe Biden offered a totally different explanation. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=305.92s)]
*  He said he can't visit the border because he's just too busy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you have plans to visit the southern border? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  I've been there before and I haven't. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I know it well. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=319.04s)]
*  I guess I should go down. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=320.72s)]
*  But the but the whole point of it is I haven't had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden doesn't have time to visit the border. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=327.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, according to the White House, Joe Biden is going to spend this weekend on vacation [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  in Delaware. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=333.92s)]
*  The only conclusion anybody can reasonably draw from all of this is that Joe Biden isn't [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=335.42s)]
*  really running things. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=340.94s)]
*  And Joe Biden himself at various points last night admitted that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=342.76s)]
*  Asked about inflation, including higher gas prices, Joe Biden straight up acknowledged [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=346.62s)]
*  that he has no idea what to do about it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=351.1s)]
*  Do you have a timeline for gas prices of when you think they may start coming down? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=353.70000000000005s)]
*  My guess is you'll start to see gas prices come down as we get by and going into the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=358.84s)]
*  winter. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, excuse me, into next year in 2022. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't see anything that's going to happen in the meantime that's going to significantly [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  reduce gas prices. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=372.12s)]
*  I don't have a near term answer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't have a near term answer. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=377.02s)]
*  In reality, Joe Biden's handlers have been begging OPEC to produce more oil and send [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=379.12s)]
*  it to us and they've been refusing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  That's the real near term answer and it's been a disaster. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=386.26s)]
*  This country was energy independent when Joe Biden took office and it's not anymore. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=390.3s)]
*  It's not clear Joe Biden realizes that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=394.68s)]
*  But if there's one thing Joe Biden knows well, it's had to deflect from his own failures. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=397.38s)]
*  That's instinctual for Joe Biden. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=402.44s)]
*  He doesn't even need to know where he is or what's happening around him. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=404.08s)]
*  He'll just do it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=407.62s)]
*  So last night, Joe Biden identified the real threat this country's facing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=408.88s)]
*  They're refusing to take the COVID vaccine, so they're to blame for all that's wrong [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=413.98s)]
*  with America, Joe Biden said, and they should be fired. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=420.02000000000004s)]
*  As many as one in three emergency responders in some cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=424.20000000000005s)]
*  right here in Baltimore, are refusing to comply with city vaccine mandates. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm wondering where you stand on that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=434.92s)]
*  Should police officers, emergency responders be mandated to get vaccines? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=436.6s)]
*  And if not, should they be stay at home or let go? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=441.42s)]
*  Yes and yes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=444.92s)]
*  Can you hear that applause right there? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=445.92s)]
*  And you realize that a lot of people are willing to put up with a dementia patient in the White [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=449.18s)]
*  House as long as he destroys their political opponents. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=452.72s)]
*  Last night's town hall demonstrated, among other things, that authoritarianism is far [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=456.74s)]
*  more popular in the Democratic Party than most Americans realize. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  Remember when Donald Trump warned the Democrats were going to start destroying statues of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=466.18s)]
*  our founding fathers? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=469.86s)]
*  Donald Trump was mocked for that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=471.66s)]
*  But last night, Joe Biden said he'd be OK with destroying statues of Thomas Jefferson [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=473.76s)]
*  and no one even batted an eye. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=479.02000000000004s)]
*  New York City is removing a statue of Thomas Jefferson from its legislative chamber because [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=481.26s)]
*  of Jefferson's history as a slave holder. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=485.72s)]
*  Do you support that decision? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=489.86s)]
*  Well, I think that's up to the locality to decide what they want to do on that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=490.86s)]
*  Thomas Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, the document [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=495.2s)]
*  that freed Americans from Great Britain. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=499.82s)]
*  Now a lot of Democrats want Thomas Jefferson's statue destroyed and Joe Biden isn't going [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=502.38s)]
*  to stop them. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=507.02s)]
*  Are you surprised by that? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=508.66s)]
*  You shouldn't be. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=509.66s)]
*  At one point, the town hall audience last night laughed at the very idea of freedom. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=510.66s)]
*  You want your constitutional and God-given right to self-determination? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=516.46s)]
*  Joe Biden and his followers think it's a punch line. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=520.1800000000001s)]
*  Look, the two things that concern me, one are those who just try to make this a political [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=523.66s)]
*  issue. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=530.5s)]
*  Freedom. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=531.5s)]
*  I have the freedom to kill you with my COVID. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=532.5s)]
*  No, I mean, come on. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=535.42s)]
*  Freedom. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=537.66s)]
*  This kind of thing happened again and again. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=538.66s)]
*  Later on, Joe Biden again suggested getting rid of the filibuster and the crowd loved [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=541.1s)]
*  it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=545.4599999999999s)]
*  As long as he's talking about crushing his political enemies, they're on board. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=546.4599999999999s)]
*  They'll forgive anything, even obvious lies. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=550.3399999999999s)]
*  For weeks, Joe Biden has claimed that this network, Fox News, mandates that its employees [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=553.3s)]
*  take the COVID shot. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=557.9s)]
*  That's never been true. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=559.8199999999999s)]
*  But last night, Joe Biden once again repeated the lie. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=560.8199999999999s)]
*  Things I find, do you realize they mandate vaccinations? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=565.74s)]
*  At Fox headquarters. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=569.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=570.0999999999999s)]
*  I find that mildly fascinating. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=571.0999999999999s)]
*  Mildly fascinating. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  Mildly fascinating. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=574.0999999999999s)]
*  And the crowd just nods their heads. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=575.0999999999999s)]
*  The moderator agrees. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=578.24s)]
*  No one corrects the lie. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=579.76s)]
*  To be clear, not a single person has been fired from Fox for refusing to get vaccinated. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=581.46s)]
*  Period. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=587.38s)]
*  After this town hall, two things are clear. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=588.82s)]
*  First, Joe Biden is not capable of thinking clearly. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=590.9000000000001s)]
*  And most Americans recognize that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=594.64s)]
*  You can't watch these clips and come to any other conclusion. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=596.7800000000001s)]
*  But as a way to signal the authority of our actual leaders, the authoritarians who write [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=599.94s)]
*  the executive orders and pass the legislation, last night's town hall was an unequivocal [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=605.62s)]
*  success. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=611.22s)]
*  It turns out that their agenda is more popular among Democrats than we thought. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=612.82s)]
*  Many Democrats now applaud disinformation. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=618.9s)]
*  They cheer for authoritarianism. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  They don't care if their dictator lies about visiting the border or thinks he's driving [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=624.2s)]
*  a car in the middle of a nationally televised town hall. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=628.26s)]
*  They just want a dictator. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=632.0600000000001s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3GwqXeASxg&t=633.5400000000001s)]
