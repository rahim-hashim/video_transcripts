# Tulsi Gabbard: Americans are being told lies by Biden and Mitch McConnell
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI)
*  Chelsea Gabbard is a former member of Congress, a former presidential candidate, and one of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=0.0s)]
*  the very few people in the world who went on television after this invasion a year ago [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  and said this could get really dangerous. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=9.64s)]
*  You were right. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=11.72s)]
*  And now that China is aligning with Russia and supporting the Russian war effort effectively [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=12.8s)]
*  against us, this seems like a massive turning point. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=18.18s)]
*  Well, you heard it from Zelensky himself talking about the consequences of World War III. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=21.92s)]
*  The thing is, he has made very clear that that's where he thinks we are already, that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=28.02s)]
*  we are in World War III. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=32.5s)]
*  Ukraine is the tip of the spear. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  And this is how he justifies demanding, making demands of the United States and all of these [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=36.46s)]
*  NATO countries to equip him with all of the weapons and aircraft and tanks that the United [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=41.56s)]
*  States and NATO have to go and fight this war that we are in against Russia. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=46.54s)]
*  He is doing everything that he can to bring us and NATO into this war, directly into conflict [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=52.14s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=58.46s)]
*  You remember when their Ukrainian defense missile defense system, unfortunately, had [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=59.46s)]
*  a missile that went into Poland and killed two civilians on a farm. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=64.02s)]
*  What did Zelensky say? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=68.42s)]
*  His very first thing, first person on camera saying, hey, this is a direct attack against [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=69.5s)]
*  the NATO ally, U.S. and NATO, you must go and attack, you must go and attack Russia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=74.9s)]
*  The scary thing to me, Tucker, is to hear people like Zelensky, to hear Democrats and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=80.8s)]
*  Republicans in the United States Congress and Biden administration officials speak so [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=85.78s)]
*  calmly and with a straight face about World War III. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=90.5s)]
*  How would it be won? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  How would we respond to the use of tactical nuclear weapons? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=95.33999999999999s)]
*  What are our options in this battlefield? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=98.86s)]
*  Forgetting what Ronald Reagan said when he said a nuclear war cannot be won and therefore [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=101.61999999999999s)]
*  should never be fought. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=107.3s)]
*  This World War III, this path that we are on, unless we change course, it will result in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=109.58s)]
*  nuclear war. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=115.5s)]
*  You've all of the nuclear armed countries in the world on this path towards a head on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=116.5s)]
*  collision. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=120.9s)]
*  I mean, let's ask a really quick question. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=121.9s)]
*  So Zelensky, who I think this country has borne with great patience, actually, for the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=123.66s)]
*  last year, has repeatedly said, I've got a border dispute with my neighbor Russia. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=129.34s)]
*  You live thousands of miles away. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=133.06s)]
*  You're not connected. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=134.18s)]
*  But because of that border dispute and their invasion of the eastern half of my country, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=135.22s)]
*  your whole family could die. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=139.34s)]
*  And I'm OK with that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=140.7s)]
*  Why aren't Americans rising up as one and saying, you're suggesting it's OK that my [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=142.82s)]
*  family dies? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=146.98s)]
*  No, it's not OK. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=147.98s)]
*  Off the stage. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  Like, why are we putting up with this, honestly? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  You know, you look at the lies that the American people are being told by President Biden, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=153.62s)]
*  by Mitch McConnell, by these warmongers in both parties selling this lie that this is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=158.06s)]
*  about defending freedom and democracy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=163.04s)]
*  And as he said, there's no greater threat to that democracy than this fight against [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=164.94s)]
*  this war against Russia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  They are the ones who are undermining our democracy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  They are the ones who are denying the American people our constitutional right to have a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=174.7s)]
*  say whether or not we go to war or not. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  It is it is an affront to the Constitution and every single American. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  And we should all be raising hell about this because it is our future, the future of the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  world that's at stake. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=190.22s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=192.61999999999998s)]
*  I mean, how much weed are people smoking? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=193.61999999999998s)]
*  This is a real issue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  This is not one of the fake issues, you know, that we there is no more real issue than that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=200.33999999999997s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=201.33999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tzeo-4uXI&t=203.26s)]
