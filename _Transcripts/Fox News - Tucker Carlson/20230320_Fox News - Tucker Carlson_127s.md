# Dr. Mark Hyman: Our concept of disease is wrong
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY)
*  Well, we're all arguing about Stormy Daniels. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=0.0s)]
*  Big things are happening. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=2.5s)]
*  The biggest of all is life expectancy in the United States going in the wrong direction. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=3.5s)]
*  One of the drivers of that is health. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=7.62s)]
*  Americans have a lot more chronic health issues than they used to. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=10.58s)]
*  Very few people have commented on this or thought about why it's happening. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=13.8s)]
*  Mark Hyman is a physician and the exception to this, really an amazing person if you're [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=16.46s)]
*  not familiar with him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  He's got a new book out called Young Forever, the Secrets to Living Long Healthy Lives. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  We talked to Mark Hyman on many recommendations. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=26.96s)]
*  You've got to talk to Mark Hyman. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=29.380000000000003s)]
*  So we did for a brand new episode of Tucker Carlson today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=30.380000000000003s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  We have developed a medical system based on historical phenomena, which is you have a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=38.22s)]
*  headache, you go to the head doctor. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=42.1s)]
*  You have a stomach ache, you go to the stomach doctor. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=43.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=45.1s)]
*  It seemed logical, except biology isn't organized that way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=46.1s)]
*  It's not the way the body's organized. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=49.540000000000006s)]
*  The body is a system. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=50.74s)]
*  So rather than treat each individual part, each individual symptom, we treat the root [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=52.34s)]
*  causes and we create health. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=56.540000000000006s)]
*  So functional medicine is the science of creating health as opposed to the science [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=58.58s)]
*  of treating disease. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=62.14s)]
*  And when you create health, disease goes away as a side effect. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=63.14s)]
*  We have our whole concept of disease wrong, that it's some entity, a thing that we catch, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=66.3s)]
*  like a cold or COVID. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=70.06s)]
*  Yes, yes, that's exactly right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=71.06s)]
*  But it's not like that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  Like someday you just get it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I get heart disease or I got diabetes or I get cancer or I get dementia or I get [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  whatever, autoimmune disease. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=77.98s)]
*  No, there are really clear causes for these problems that are rooted in things that we [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=79.66s)]
*  now know that we haven't translated into medical practice. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=83.9s)]
*  And if for every 10% of your calories is ultra processed food, your risk of death goes up [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=86.58s)]
*  by 14%. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=91.46s)]
*  And our diet is 60% ultra processed food and kids is 67%. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=92.94s)]
*  It's a national emergency, honestly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's 6 million people that die from COVID globally, but 11 million people [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=101.22s)]
*  die every year from bad food. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=104.86s)]
*  That's an amazing conversation, even if you love pizza and Oreos, as some of us do. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=109.3s)]
*  Dr. Mark Hyman, tomorrow, 70-month vaccination, you can stream it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=112.82s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=116.86s)]

*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5zuBhWi3rY&t=124.5s)]
