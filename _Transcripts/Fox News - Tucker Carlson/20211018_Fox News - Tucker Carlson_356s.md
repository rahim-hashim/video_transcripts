# Tucker: Anyone who thinks Russia is biggest threat is national security threat
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc)
*  Well, about five years ago, the Hillary Clinton for President campaign paid a British spy called Christopher Steele to produce a document now known as the Steele dossier, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=0.0s)]
*  which despite the fact was fraudulent, really hamstrung the Trump administration virtually for the entire four years. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=9.0s)]
*  That dossier claimed that Russian hackers were operating in the Russian consulate in Miami, even though, for example, there is no Russian consulate in Miami. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=16.0s)]
*  Among other false claims, the dossier said that Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, made secret trips to Prague. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=25.0s)]
*  Now, if Cohen had been to Prague, he probably would have said so since he turned on Trump completely, but he swore he didn't. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=31.0s)]
*  Most famously, the dossier said the Russians possessed a lurid tape that they were using to blackmail Donald Trump, the famous P tape. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=37.0s)]
*  All this was false. And yet in a new documentary, Christopher Steele says, maybe not surprisingly, he stands by all of it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=46.0s)]
*  Do you still believe that that tape exists? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=55.0s)]
*  I think it probably does, but I wouldn't put 100% certainty on it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=58.0s)]
*  So how do you explain if that tape does indeed exist and hasn't been released? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=62.0s)]
*  Well, it hasn't needed to be released. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=66.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=68.0s)]
*  Because I think the Russians felt they'd got pretty good value out of Donald Trump when he was president of the U.S. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=69.0s)]
*  Anything you believe you got just wrong? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=74.0s)]
*  The interview I gave to Mother Jones. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=76.0s)]
*  That was a mistake. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=79.0s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=80.0s)]
*  But not the P tape, not Michael Cohen in Prague, not Carter Page. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=81.0s)]
*  None of those things, to my mind, have been disproven. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=86.0s)]
*  Totally destroyed Carter Page's life, by the way. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=91.0s)]
*  The P tape, I've never seen it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=93.0s)]
*  Nobody knows it exists, but it probably exists because Trump sucked up to Russia so much, which, by the way, the administration sanctioned like eight times during those. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=95.0s)]
*  The whole thing's demented. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=103.0s)]
*  And yet the media seem intent on rehabilitating this Christopher Steele guy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=104.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=108.0s)]
*  Well, here's one clue. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=109.0s)]
*  Later in the interview, Steele warned that if Donald Trump runs again, he'd be a threat to national security. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=110.0s)]
*  He's making moves, perhaps. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=116.0s)]
*  Trump is to run again in 2024. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=118.0s)]
*  Do you think if he runs again, he's a threat to United States national security, to the national security of the United Kingdom? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=120.0s)]
*  Yes, potentially. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=129.0s)]
*  A threat to our national security. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=132.0s)]
*  This is a country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=135.0s)]
*  We live in a country where our national security establishment sincerely believes or claims to that Russia is the greatest threat we face. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=136.0s)]
*  Anyone who thinks that is, by definition, a threat to our actual national security, because that's absurd and it's a distraction from the looming threat from the East, obviously. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=143.0s)]
*  But the question is, how does someone like Steele, who's a buffoon, not even an American citizen, have the power to influence our political system so completely? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=153.0s)]
*  Cash Patel lived this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=161.0s)]
*  He's a former White House Intel Committee national security adviser. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=163.0s)]
*  Devin Nunes is ranking member on the House Intel Committee. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=166.0s)]
*  He was the chairman when Republicans controlled the House. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=168.0s)]
*  They've spent years on this dossier. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=170.0s)]
*  They both join us tonight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=173.0s)]
*  Thank you both very much for coming on Cash to You First. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=174.0s)]
*  So, Christopher Steele, I would assume, since you know an awful lot about the details in this dossier, you believe owes the world a groveling apology. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=177.0s)]
*  Not to put words in your mouth. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=185.0s)]
*  An apology would be starters. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=189.0s)]
*  Thanks for having us, Tucker. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=190.0s)]
*  Look, Devin Nunes was strong enough to lead the charge that unearthed the false allegations in the dossier that the Hillary campaign paid for it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=191.0s)]
*  More fraudulently, crooks like Lisa Page and Peter Strzok coupled with Christopher Steele ran a false investigation into Trump for 14 months. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=198.0s)]
*  Not just one FISA application, four FISA applications. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=207.0s)]
*  And this guy now lit the world on fire, and he now wants an us to apologize to him for misleading millions of Americans. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=210.0s)]
*  I think that is the height of hypocrisy, and that is why people hate the FBI so much, including Christopher Steele as its greatest source in the last 20 years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's for sure. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=225.0s)]
*  So, Congressman Nunes, I mean, one of the effects of the Russia hoax was to prevent the last administration from cleaning house in the permanent bureaucracy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=226.0s)]
*  And maybe, just to guess, you tell me that's one of the reasons the so-called intel community and the DOJ, the second Biden took over, were still there in full force to, you know, take away the civil liberties of Trump voters. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=234.0s)]
*  Well, I would also say, Tucker, that most of the people that were involved in the so-called P-tape and the dossier got promotions by the Biden administration. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=246.0s)]
*  So they were resurrected old Obama people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=255.0s)]
*  But, you know, furthermore, you have to remember, it's Steele himself who was actually working for Russians, okay, in the past. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=257.0s)]
*  And what did he do? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=264.0s)]
*  He interfered in our election, the very thing he's claiming in this documentary that he was trying to protect. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=265.0s)]
*  He's some kind of patriot. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=271.0s)]
*  It's just, it's comical. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=272.0s)]
*  Well, it is comical. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=275.0s)]
*  Kash Patel, I wonder, can you think of anybody? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=276.0s)]
*  So here you have a history-changing lie. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=279.0s)]
*  This is not just the earth is flat kind of thing, but this was a lie with the purpose to hamstring a Democratic elected administration. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=282.0s)]
*  Has anybody ever been held accountable for this that you're aware of? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=290.0s)]
*  No, not internally at the FBI, but I hope John Durham's on the march to secure indictments against. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=296.0s)]
*  Look, Christopher Steele and the FBI knew from jump that the information was bogus. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=302.0s)]
*  They fed it to a court anyway, and they lied about it in the media and possibly leaked classified information. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=306.0s)]
*  This guy is no hero. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=312.0s)]
*  He is no James Bond. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=314.0s)]
*  He's Inspector Gadget on Sudafed, and now he's crying for the world to love him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=315.0s)]
*  Let's not forget the lives he wrecked along the way of American citizens and the likes of myself and Devin Nunes because we exposed it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=320.0s)]
*  He came after us along with the fake news media, and we're fighting on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=326.0s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=330.0s)]
*  And I wish you had more time because both of you guys suffered personally. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=331.0s)]
*  I hope you will come back to explain how your own lives changed in the middle of all this because I know that they did. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=333.0s)]
*  Cash Patel, Devin Nunes, thank you both. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D--4g9YUzc&t=339.0s)]
