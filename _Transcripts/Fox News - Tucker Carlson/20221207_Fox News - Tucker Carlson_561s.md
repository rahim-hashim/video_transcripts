# Tucker Carlson: Zelenskyy's cabinet is devising ways to punish Christians
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=0.0s)]
*  So you remember when Russia invaded Ukraine in February. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=3.52s)]
*  And at that time, our leaders told us this wasn't some far away conflict in Eastern Europe. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=6.76s)]
*  This was our war. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=11.92s)]
*  No military should ever be allowed to invade a sovereign nation, they told us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=14.06s)]
*  Iraq and Afghanistan obviously not included in that rule. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=18.04s)]
*  The invasion of Ukraine could not stand because it was a matter of first principles. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=20.86s)]
*  But more than that, it was a world's historic moral battle that we were obligated to join. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=25.04s)]
*  It was very clear Vladimir Putin was pure evil. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=30.04s)]
*  He was Hitler reborn. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=32.44s)]
*  The Ukrainian president Zelensky was his mirror image. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=34.0s)]
*  He was saint-like. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  Self-denying, brave, honest, very handsome. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=39.28s)]
*  And Zelensky was fighting for the very same ideals that our country was founded on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=43.12s)]
*  A number of news outlets, including CNN and the LA Times, compared him to George Washington. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=48.4s)]
*  So they told us that with one voice, month after month, no disagreement allowed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=54.36s)]
*  Not surprisingly, it worked. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=59.52s)]
*  Americans fell hard for President Zelensky. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  They all did. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=64.12s)]
*  Even in rural areas that voted against Joe Biden, you saw Ukrainian flags hanging from mailboxes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=65.12s)]
*  To many people, it felt like World War II again. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=71.04s)]
*  The Good War. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  A battle against tyranny abroad for the sake of freedom and democracy at home. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Well the better part of a year later, it's getting harder and harder to believe any of this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  Whatever you think of the war in Ukraine, it is pretty clear that Zelensky has no interest [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=83.64s)]
*  in freedom and democracy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=88.74s)]
*  In fact, Zelensky is far closer to Lenin than to George Washington. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  He is a dictator. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  He is a dangerous authoritarian who has used $100 billion in U.S. tax dollars to erect [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  a one-party police state in Ukraine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  And that's not an overstatement. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Over the past year, Zelensky has banned opposition parties. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=105.61999999999999s)]
*  He shut down critical media by force. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=109.0s)]
*  He's arrested his political opponents. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=111.34s)]
*  He has sent soldiers into churches. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=113.52s)]
*  Zelensky's secret police have raided monasteries across Ukraine, even a convent full of nuns, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=117.14s)]
*  and arrested dozens of priests for no justifiable reason whatsoever and in clear violation of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=122.86s)]
*  the Ukrainian constitution, which no longer matters. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=128.34s)]
*  And in the face of this, the Biden administration has said nothing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=131.74s)]
*  Not one word. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=135.2s)]
*  Instead, they just continue to push to send Zelensky more tax dollars. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=136.2s)]
*  So naturally, Zelensky has become much bolder. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=139.98s)]
*  Why wouldn't he? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=142.54s)]
*  Last week, he announced his plan to ban an entire religion, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=144.32s)]
*  and to seize its property, all for being insufficiently loyal to his regime. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=149.1s)]
*  And he said it out loud. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=154.04s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=155.12s)]
*  We have to create such conditions when any people dependent on the country aggressor [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=156.12s)]
*  won't be able to manipulate Ukrainians and weaken Ukraine from within. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=163.52s)]
*  First, the National Security and Defense Council instructed the government to submit to the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=167.76s)]
*  Verkhovna Rada, a draft law on making it impossible for religious organizations affiliated [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=172.88s)]
*  with centers of influence in the Russian Federation to operate in Ukraine. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=178.76s)]
*  A free country does not ban a major religion just because it's not fully on board with [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=184.56s)]
*  the political program of the people running the country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=188.84s)]
*  But Zelensky's doing that, and his cabinet is now devising ways to punish Christians [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=192.28s)]
*  for practicing their banned ancient religion in Ukraine. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=196.06s)]
*  Personal, economic, and restrictive sanctions will be applied to any Christian caught worshiping [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  in unapproved ways. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=205.08s)]
*  Now the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is more than a thousand years old. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  With the full backing of the Joe Biden administration in the U.S. Congress, Zelensky has decided [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=211.84s)]
*  to ban it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=215.76s)]
*  So here's the response of one bishop to the news. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=217.56s)]
*  You're not allowed to send soldiers into churches. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=229.84s)]
*  You're not allowed to arrest dozens of priests because they refuse to bow before you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  You're not allowed to ban whole religions. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=258.24s)]
*  So most of the U.S. media, most, have just ignored this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=261.88s)]
*  Some have made excuses for it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=264.88s)]
*  Oh, he has to do this because there's a war. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=266.2s)]
*  But there's no justification for this whatsoever. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  The Ukrainian Orthodox Church is not Russian, it's Ukrainian. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=272.08s)]
*  It has no connection to the Putin government. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=275.04s)]
*  It has in fact officially denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=277.08s)]
*  So once again, there is no justification for destroying and banning this church. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=280.88s)]
*  And yet Zelensky's many celebrity backers in the West have said nothing about it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=286.48s)]
*  And they should know better. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=291.24s)]
*  In May, George W. Bush, the great defender of Christendom, met with Zelensky on a Zoom [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  call and afterward described him as the Winston Churchill of our time, a man who should be [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=297.76s)]
*  praised for his quote, commitment to liberty. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=301.94s)]
*  So where's George W. Bush on this question now that his friend, the George Washington [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=304.88s)]
*  of Ukraine has banned a form of Christianity in that country? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=309.04s)]
*  Well, George W. Bush has been silent as well. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=312.24s)]
*  You have many purportedly Christian members of Congress. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=314.6s)]
*  Their backing is Zelensky no matter how many Christians he arrests, no matter how many [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=316.82000000000005s)]
*  churches he seizes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=320.18s)]
*  To the Ukrainian people, you can expect the Congress to be there with you in terms of [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=322.76000000000005s)]
*  supporting your efforts to maintain your freedom. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  Everything that we can do to be helpful to them as they fight for their freedom. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=334.16s)]
*  I think the history of the 21st century turns on how fiercely we defend freedom in Ukraine. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=339.1s)]
*  We will continue to provide military equipment so that Ukraine can defend its territory and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=344.36s)]
*  its freedom. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=349.04s)]
*  The United States will continue our unwavering support for Ukraine as it defends its freedom. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=350.04s)]
*  And let's get the job done so that we can save lives in Ukraine and defend the cause [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=354.64s)]
*  of freedom. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=358.72s)]
*  The free world had no choice. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=359.72s)]
*  America could not stand by. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  American people did what they always have done, defend freedom around the world. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=364.44s)]
*  You just watched has campaigned many to make a habit of campaigning Lindsey Graham, ladies [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=371.02s)]
*  and gentlemen, in Christian churches in the United States. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=375.82s)]
*  Well, a single Christian leader say anything to them about this. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=378.5s)]
*  You are funding the destruction of Christianity in Ukraine. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=381.53999999999996s)]
*  Oh, but it's the cause of freedom. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=384.53999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=386.85999999999996s)]
*  The reality is that Ukrainians cannot listen to media outlets that criticize the Zelensky [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=387.85999999999996s)]
*  government because they've been banned. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  They cannot play music from Russian singers. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=394.41999999999996s)]
*  No, this is not in Taliban controlled Afghanistan. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=397.18s)]
*  This is in the democracy of Ukraine that we support. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=400.0s)]
*  They can't play music from Russian singers. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=402.6s)]
*  They can't vote for an opposition party because they've all been shut down. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=404.1s)]
*  And now their churches are being raided and their priests arrested. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=407.04s)]
*  So the fact that our leaders are calling this freedom tells you a lot about what they're [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=410.2s)]
*  planning here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=413.38s)]
*  Of course, why would you defend this? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=414.68s)]
*  Because you approve of it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=416.38s)]
*  For its part, Ukraine's defense ministry has stopped pretending this is about freedom. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=418.12s)]
*  They're just happy they're getting paid and they're finally crushing any opposition in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=421.68s)]
*  their own country. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=425.8s)]
*  And that's why Ukraine's military is now using your tax dollars to produce choreographed [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=428.0s)]
*  dance videos for social media consumption. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=431.72s)]
*  Sort of like the COVID nurses. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=434.84s)]
*  Here's one of them. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=436.16s)]
*  It's just a grotesque postmodern Psy-op and anyone who's fallen for this is brain damaged. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=458.44s)]
*  This is the same Ukrainian defense ministry that lied about the ghost of Kiev and the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=466.12s)]
*  sailors who cursed out the Russian ship. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=469.76s)]
*  Now they're just having fun. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=471.44s)]
*  Because they're beating their real enemies, which of course, as always, are domestic. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=473.64s)]
*  And Time magazine is fully on board with this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=477.12s)]
*  They disinformed their four remaining readers that Zelensky's president is the person of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=478.72s)]
*  the year. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=482.44s)]
*  And the media chorus is in full scream. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=484.04s)]
*  And John Meacham, the purported historian and MSNBC, believes that Zelensky is really [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=486.44s)]
*  a lot like the pope. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=491.6s)]
*  Zelensky is being fired by the best fundamental impulses in human nature, which is to stand, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=493.76s)]
*  to defend, to articulate, to fight back. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=500.8s)]
*  And I think it's also important to remember that he is a performer. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=504.56s)]
*  That's where he started. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=510.72s)]
*  John Paul II was a performer. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=511.72s)]
*  Ronald Reagan was a performer. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=514.96s)]
*  Winston Churchill understood the means of the media of his time. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=517.52s)]
*  He understood the power of radio. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  Franklin Roosevelt understood radio. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=524.76s)]
*  It's not coincidental that great leaders understand. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=528.24s)]
*  Great leaders. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=533.96s)]
*  So if they'll defend a man who shut down opposition media, arrested his political opponents, arrested [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  priests, sent the army into monasteries and then banned a religion, if they'll defend [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=541.44s)]
*  all of that and call it liberty, they'll defend anything. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06jNW8cVIVg&t=546.36s)]
