# Larry Elder: This is the only reason Kamala Harris became Vice President
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA)
*  So no one outside of her own neighborhood had ever heard of Kamala Harris before she [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=0.0s)]
*  showed up as Willie Brown's girlfriend. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=5.86s)]
*  Then a few years later she became Montell Williams' girlfriend. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=7.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=10.92s)]
*  Long before she met Doug Emhoff, she dated some prominent men, including in 2001, former [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=11.92s)]
*  talk show host Montell Williams. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=17.28s)]
*  Back then, he was the famous one and had to introduce her to the paparazzi. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=19.84s)]
*  It's interesting that that tape never played anywhere before the election. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=29.72s)]
*  It probably wouldn't have made a difference, but it would have been nice to know. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=33.64s)]
*  Anyway, as you know, Kamala Harris somehow went on to become a senator and then the vice [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=37.0s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=41.28s)]
*  Now, she accomplished all of that without really any support from actual voters. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  We know that because there's a lot of polling on it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=47.32s)]
*  Virtually no one in California, her home state, for example, supported her presidential campaign. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=48.84s)]
*  And now currently she has an approval rating of 28%, right around Jeffrey Dahmer's approval [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=53.36s)]
*  rating. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Moments like this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  She would tell the story about how, so they're marching. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  And this is back when strollers didn't really have armrests and seat belts. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=65.76s)]
*  So they're marching away and, you know, shouting and all of that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=69.68s)]
*  And then I think it was my Uncle Freddie, you know, looked down and then looked in the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=75.44s)]
*  stroller, which was empty. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  And said, where's Kamala? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  And apparently they left me like a block behind. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  I'd fallen out the stroller. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  And then my mother would tell a funny story about how, like one day she, and I was fussing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  and you know, and so I'm fussing and fussing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=99.2s)]
*  It's much cuter when she would tell the story, but she'd say, so then she would look down [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=102.0s)]
*  at me and Kamala, what do you want? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=105.28s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=106.82s)]
*  And I looked back up at her and I said, freedom! [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=107.82s)]
*  It's just fascinating watching that, how transparently false it is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  It's like everyone went along with what everyone could tell was a lie. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=117.22s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  So Larry Elder is from California. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=121.94s)]
*  In fact, he just ran for governor of California. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=123.38s)]
*  We strongly supported him in that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  He's a radio host there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  He joins us tonight to assess Kamala Harris. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  Larry Elder, great to see you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=131.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=132.62s)]
*  You too. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=133.62s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=134.62s)]
*  You've watched Kamala Harris for years. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=135.62s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=139.22s)]
*  It's baffling to me. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=140.62s)]
*  Well it is baffling because if you look at it on paper, Tucker, she's a pretty successful [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=143.14s)]
*  politician. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=147.5s)]
*  She ran for and got elected attorney general in California, beating out her competition. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=148.5s)]
*  She ran for and got elected senator, beating out her competition. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=152.46s)]
*  And then she had this disaster run as vice president. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=156.26s)]
*  And as you pointed out, even people in California didn't support her. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=159.1s)]
*  You know, the key to being a successful politician, having been one for eight weeks, a couple [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=161.94s)]
*  of things, is authenticity and likability. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=166.32s)]
*  And she has neither. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=171.2s)]
*  And part of it is because you look at things like her record as AG. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=172.84s)]
*  She was known as a soft on crime, pardon me, hard on crime AG. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=177.2s)]
*  And then she got kind of busted during the debate with Tulsi Gabber when she pointed [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  out that she prosecuted marijuana offenders, not possession, but offenders, dealers, and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  then joked about marijuana on a radio program. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=191.76s)]
*  She also bragged that she was the last person in the room when Joe Biden made the decision [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=195.08s)]
*  to pull out of Afghanistan, which means she parted that decision. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=200.84s)]
*  And the only reason, in my opinion, she became vice president is because she checked all [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=205.02s)]
*  the boxes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=208.8s)]
*  The Democrats in this woke era are no longer going to have two white males on the ticket. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=209.8s)]
*  It's got to be at least a person of color, hopefully a person of color who's a female. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  So she checked all the boxes and has proven herself to be basically utterly incompetent. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  They're now backbiting. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=222.44s)]
*  She's even accused, or at least one of her staffers has accused Joe Biden of being racist. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=224.28s)]
*  So she's not unwilling to pull the race card in order to defend herself. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=228.28s)]
*  And that's offended a lot of people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=231.4s)]
*  You play her laugh. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=233.48s)]
*  She has this cackle that a lot of people just find off-putting. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=235.36s)]
*  When she gets into a tough position, when she doesn't have an answer for something, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=239.36s)]
*  when somebody corners her, she reverts to this silly laughter. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  And it just angers people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=246.88s)]
*  And Tucker, if I can say one more thing, it's not fixed in stone. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=248.8s)]
*  The good news for her is that 2024 is a mile away. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=252.6s)]
*  And as you know, that's an eternity in politics. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=255.88s)]
*  And you can change that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=259.44s)]
*  Ronald Reagan was perceived by all of us who knew him as a sunny, optimistic guy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=260.68s)]
*  But a lot of Democrats didn't feel that way until he was shot. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=265.6s)]
*  And here he is, the most anger he could summon against his would-be assassin was, what's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=268.56s)]
*  that guy's beef? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=272.36s)]
*  And as he'd been wheeling to the operating room, he tells the doctors, I hope you guys [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=273.64s)]
*  are all Republicans. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=277.48s)]
*  And he told Nancy Reagan, I forgot to duck. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=278.84s)]
*  And people said, wow, he really is genuine. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=282.04s)]
*  He really is likable. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=284.36s)]
*  So it's possible to change it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=285.36s)]
*  But given Carlima Harris's numbers, given her track record, given this laugh, given [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=286.96s)]
*  the way she's run away from her record as being tough on crime, she had the most left-wing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=291.24s)]
*  voting record, more left-wing than Bernie Sanders, and then positioned herself as a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=295.96s)]
*  centrist. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=300.08s)]
*  Sometimes she says she's a black woman when she ran. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=301.08s)]
*  Sometimes she says she's an Asian Indian woman when she ran out here in California. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=303.12s)]
*  So she's perceived to be utterly inauthentic and utterly unlikable. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=306.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'd rather have Willie Brown any day. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  And I don't agree with Willie Brown, but at least he's a real person. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=313.88s)]
*  No, I think it's very nicely put, Larry Elder. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=316.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=319.0s)]
*  Good to see you tonight. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajee6-OMiuA&t=320.0s)]
