# Gov. Abbott: Mexico must step up
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY)
*  So the state of Texas announced today they're going to start busing illegal immigrants, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=0.0s)]
*  more than a million have come through Texas in the last year, to Washington, D.C. And we [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=4.32s)]
*  criticize that. I mean, it's a pretty funny idea, but the real question is how do you keep people [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=8.8s)]
*  who have no right to be here out of the country in the first place? And actually, to be fair, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=13.44s)]
*  the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, may have come up with a plan to do that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=17.76s)]
*  So the governor of the Nuevo León province of Mexico has just announced he promises to curb [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  illegal migration north. He's doing this in response to something Greg Abbott did. Abbott [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=28.16s)]
*  imposed strict safety checks on trucks coming from several provinces in Mexico. So this is a huge [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=33.28s)]
*  economic problem for Mexico. Abbott said he'd lift the new requirements if the Mexican government [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=38.96s)]
*  of these provinces agreed to do something about the migrants. And one province has now agreed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=45.04s)]
*  We hope that others soon follow. We wanted to hear more about this from the governor of Texas, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=50.56s)]
*  Greg Abbott, who joins us tonight. Governor, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=54.0s)]
*  My pleasure, Tucker. So what we have done is we implemented what we call enhanced safety inspections [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=58.31999999999999s)]
*  of every commercial vehicle coming across the border, of every border crossing from Mexico into [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=64.56s)]
*  the state of Texas. And it had the predictable result. And that is it's stalled traffic for miles [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=72.0s)]
*  in New Mexico, basically crashing economic conditions in these states as well as in the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  country of Mexico and having severe economic consequences for businesses in Mexico. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=83.6s)]
*  And the predictable result is that these governors of states that are connected to the state of Texas [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=88.96s)]
*  would be knocking on our door begging for relief. And as they beg for relief, we are demanding that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  they implement security measures that will reduce illegal immigration coming across their border. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=100.96s)]
*  There are different standards that we will be applying to different states that are connected [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=106.32s)]
*  to the state of Texas. Yesterday, we announced an agreement with the governor of Nuevo León. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=109.6s)]
*  Today, we are hammering out details with two more states that are adjacent to Texas, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=115.6s)]
*  that have border crossings in Texas, that will have some different measures, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=121.44s)]
*  different measures that enhance security that stops the flow of illegal immigrants [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  from their states to the state of Texas. And then there will be one more state, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=129.2s)]
*  governor, that we are dealing with tomorrow to try to hammer out details with them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=132.88s)]
*  Altogether, we expect and we demand that on the Mexican side, they finally step up and stop [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=136.8s)]
*  these low water crossings and other actions that are allowing these illegal immigrants [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=144.4s)]
*  to cross the border. If they fail to do that, we are going to continue with our right to inspect [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=149.36s)]
*  every single vehicle coming across that bridge into the state of Texas, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=155.12s)]
*  regardless of the economic consequences it poses to Mexico. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  So, I mean, this suggests that politicians in Mexico have been [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=163.52s)]
*  abetting this mass migration into the United States. It's about to get worse, as you know, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=167.2s)]
*  next month when the Biden administration lifts any kind of COVID restrictions on immigration. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=171.84s)]
*  We're expecting a huge wave into your state. Do you think this is enough to stop it? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=176.24s)]
*  Listen, this is a meaningful step to reduce it. There are other measures that the state of Texas [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=182.56s)]
*  has taken to make sure that we are addressing this as fully as we can. We are the only state [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=188.4s)]
*  in the history of America to build a border wall. We're laying down miles of razor wire. We're [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  putting boat blockades on the river to prevent people from coming across. We are turning back [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=199.68s)]
*  people who are trying either trying to cross the border or do cross the border, turning them back. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=207.36s)]
*  Those who make it through, we are arresting and putting in jail. So we are using multiple strategies [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=212.0s)]
*  to reduce the migration into the state of Texas. Tucker, one consequence of this, you may see [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=217.52s)]
*  heightened migration attempts in other states like New Mexico and California where there are [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=223.36s)]
*  being less resistance as Texas is, but our job is to make it as difficult as possible for the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=228.0s)]
*  cartels to get people to move people across the border in the state of Texas. Our goal is to put [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=234.0s)]
*  the cartels out of business, make them lose money trying to smuggle people into the state of Texas. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=238.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, Texas is all you can control. You're only the governor of one state. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=243.52s)]
*  And this seems promising. Governor Greg Abbott, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=249.52s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvf2pabh_ZY&t=254.56s)]
