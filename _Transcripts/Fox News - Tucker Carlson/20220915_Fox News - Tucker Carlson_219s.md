# Pro-life activist Lila Rose recounts clash with Dr. Phil audience
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU)
*  So people used to make fun of, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=0.0s)]
*  and we may have even done it ourselves, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=2.2s)]
*  Dr. Phil's show as some kind of celebrity freak show arena, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=3.86s)]
*  but in real life in 2020 too, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=7.5s)]
*  you may find more interesting and more honest guests [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=11.58s)]
*  on Dr. Phil's show than you're gonna find on NBC News. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=13.98s)]
*  Case in point, Dr. Phil recently interviewed Lila Rose, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=16.3s)]
*  the pro-life activist. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=20.22s)]
*  She's not getting on Morning Joe. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=21.48s)]
*  So she came on a guest, tried to shout her down, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=23.14s)]
*  and here's how she reacted. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=25.66s)]
*  You have no empathy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=27.82s)]
*  Abortion is devastating to women's mental health. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  No one talks about that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=32.28s)]
*  The year after a woman has an abortion. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=33.72s)]
*  You know what it's really like though? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=35.16s)]
*  The year after a woman- [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=36.0s)]
*  They have to have the child. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  What kind of trauma is that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=37.96s)]
*  that you're inducing on somebody? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=38.8s)]
*  The trauma is from the rape. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=39.64s)]
*  The trauma is from the rape. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  The child's an innocent party there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=41.48s)]
*  The child isn't born yet. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=43.2s)]
*  It's not there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=44.68s)]
*  We should not take out generational sin on a child [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=45.72s)]
*  to say there's generational sin [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  and that dad was an abuser, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=50.3s)]
*  so the child should be killed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=51.68s)]
*  But here's the thing, we're not even talking about [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  sin at this rate. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=53.34s)]
*  That's not fair to the child. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=54.18s)]
*  We're talking about rights. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  And he just said, we've been taken, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=55.84s)]
*  a right has been taken away from us. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=57.36s)]
*  And what is- [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=59.78s)]
*  I want to address that because our fundamental human right [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  that we all share in this room is life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  It's the first human right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=65.02s)]
*  Laws are meant to protect the weak. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=66.4s)]
*  In a society, who's the weakest? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=67.94s)]
*  Who's the weakest in the society? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=69.66s)]
*  A child. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=70.9s)]
*  But whether you live 10 minutes [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  or 10 years or a hundred years, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=73.26s)]
*  you're a human life and you have the right to not be killed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of an amazing exchange. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=80.1s)]
*  The nose ring girl is clearly damaged. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=81.86s)]
*  She's mad, deeply mad about something. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=83.42s)]
*  And Lila Rose, this isn't easy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=85.38s)]
*  We can tell you stays totally calm during the whole thing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=87.36s)]
*  She's president of live action. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=90.22s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=91.34s)]
*  Lila Rose, thank you for coming on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=92.18s)]
*  and for showing how you really do win an argument. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=94.42s)]
*  Not by drowning the other person out with rage [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=98.58s)]
*  or shouting him down, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=100.78s)]
*  but by calmly saying what you really think. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=101.62s)]
*  I think you win people when you do that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=103.98s)]
*  Well, thanks Tucker. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=107.78s)]
*  I mean, I'm fighting and we're fighting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=108.94s)]
*  for something really beautiful. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=111.42s)]
*  That's human lives. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=112.88s)]
*  And so it's, and what's there to be worked up over, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=114.22s)]
*  it's the evil of abortion. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=119.62s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the truth sets people free. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=120.94s)]
*  So when we are equipped with the truth to share that, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=123.26s)]
*  and if I go on a show like Dr. Phil and sharing facts [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  that are about scientific development [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=128.78s)]
*  of human life in the womb, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=130.76s)]
*  facts about the evil of abortion, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=132.18s)]
*  the facts speak for themselves. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=134.44s)]
*  So it's a powerful message [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=135.7s)]
*  that I'm privileged to get to share. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=137.86s)]
*  You never dismiss, I noticed, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=140.16s)]
*  the suffering of the young woman or any woman [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=142.1s)]
*  who's pregnant and doesn't wanna be. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=146.18s)]
*  There's obviously real suffering there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  She feels helpless and terrified. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=148.78s)]
*  But you also point out that abortion killing this child [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=150.74s)]
*  hurts the woman too. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  And maybe that's why there's so much rage around this issue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=156.2s)]
*  I mean, I think you're spot on. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  We're actually about to launch Can't Stay Silent, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  which is a white paper, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=164.26s)]
*  but also a series of many videos, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=165.82s)]
*  testimonies of women who've had abortions [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=168.22s)]
*  and had the courage afterwards to speak out [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=170.3s)]
*  about how devastating abortion was for them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=172.82000000000002s)]
*  The metadata proves that there is serious mental health [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=175.44s)]
*  risks to women who have abortions afterwards. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=179.38000000000002s)]
*  In the year after having an abortion, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=182.06s)]
*  150% more likely to commit suicide. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  So that message is part of the pro-life message to say, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=186.9s)]
*  listen, don't do it, choose life. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=189.02s)]
*  There are people that wanna help you [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  and life is worth fighting for. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  And if you cared about women, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=194.46s)]
*  as they say they do at Planned Parenthood, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  you would care about that, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=197.44s)]
*  but they don't care about women. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=198.3s)]
*  Exactly. They care about more abortions, of course. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=199.56s)]
*  Lila Rose, I appreciate your coming on and your calmness. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=205.56s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dULL2usF3BU&t=207.12s)]
