# They wanted to intimidate me into silence, but that won’t happen: Libs of TikTok creator
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ)
*  Lots of questions here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We hope we can get to the bottom of all of them. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=0.96s)]
*  We're gonna start tonight by talking to the creator [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=2.68s)]
*  of Libs of TikTok who joins us right now by phone. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=4.64s)]
*  And we appreciate your coming on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=7.2s)]
*  So I just have to ask, cause I'm really interested. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=9.76s)]
*  Why do you suppose the German government [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  wanted to shut down your Twitter feed? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=13.68s)]
*  Well, I think that what I'm doing is very effective. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=18.44s)]
*  And I think that a lot of people wanted to shut me down. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=21.52s)]
*  They wanted to intimidate me into silence. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=25.84s)]
*  And unfortunately for them, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=29.68s)]
*  that's just never gonna happen. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm grateful to hear that you're not intimidated. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=34.2s)]
*  Were you a little surprised to see of all people, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=36.4s)]
*  Taylor Renz, who complained bitterly [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=38.28s)]
*  when we used her name on the air several months ago, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=40.72s)]
*  who whined and cried on television because she had PTSD [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=44.64s)]
*  cause people were criticizing her online. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=48.16s)]
*  Were you surprised that it was her [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  who came after you personally [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=52.24s)]
*  and tried to destroy your life? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that was really humorous. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  It added a really nice layer of humor [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=59.16s)]
*  on top of the whole story. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=61.96s)]
*  And I think that the fact that it was Taylor Renz, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=63.68s)]
*  who is a known hypocrite and keen, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=67.2s)]
*  is known to donk people. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=71.12s)]
*  The fact that it was her that was doing all this, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=72.84s)]
*  I think it just helps people rally with support for me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=75.92s)]
*  Have you noticed, I mean, I know you're not a psychiatrist, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=81.08s)]
*  or perhaps you are, I don't know who you are. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=83.12s)]
*  But are you surprised that the people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=85.56s)]
*  who are the most deeply enmeshed in narcissism, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=87.84s)]
*  who talk about themselves the most, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  are also capable of the greatest cruelty? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=93.72s)]
*  Have you noticed that trend? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=96.36s)]
*  Yes, I've noticed that a lot. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  I've noticed it with a lot of TikToks as well. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=101.04s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of a trend on the left. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=103.88s)]
*  Yeah, I obsess over myself, so I'm willing to hurt you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  So what's your status as, since we have you on the phone, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=111.92s)]
*  how are you doing tonight? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  Where are, I mean, you don't need to tell us where you are, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=115.48s)]
*  but how has this affected your life, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=117.32s)]
*  this Jeff Bezos piece? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, the past two days have been very chaotic [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=121.24s)]
*  and overwhelming. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  I had to make some travel plans really fast, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  but I was not planning on earlier, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=130.64s)]
*  so there was a little bit of coordination [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=132.72s)]
*  that had to happen, and I'm now in a location [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=135.6s)]
*  where I don't think anyone would find me, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=139.64s)]
*  not in any of the locations that Taylor Lorenz leaked [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=142.04s)]
*  or that anyone can find, but it's been a little bit tough, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=145.8s)]
*  but I'm not gonna let this get me down. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=150.84s)]
*  Well, I hope we see you in our studio someday. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=154.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us tonight, we appreciate it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2F2RJmI-LQ&t=155.8s)]
