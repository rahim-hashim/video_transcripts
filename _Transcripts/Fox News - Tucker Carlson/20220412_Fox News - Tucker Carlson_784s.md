# Tucker: This could break the Democratic Party
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, has there been, look back, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=2.2s)]
*  a single 24-hour period since Joe Biden became the president [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  when you haven't been horrified [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=7.44s)]
*  by something you saw on the news? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=11.08s)]
*  The cascade of absurdities has been relentless. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=12.24s)]
*  It's like nothing any American has ever seen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=14.48s)]
*  And today, we're sad to say, it was especially depressing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Inflation hit another record high, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=18.84s)]
*  and that's according to the cooked government statistics [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=21.0s)]
*  our leaders have devised to hide inflation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=23.44s)]
*  But it turns out there's no hiding the price of meat and gas. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=26.34s)]
*  The value of the dollar has dropped off a cliff, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=29.34s)]
*  even as the value of the Russian ruble is rising. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=31.44s)]
*  So ponder that for a moment and chuckle bitterly to yourself. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=35.3s)]
*  And then in New York City this morning, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=39.18s)]
*  16 people were shot on the subway in Brooklyn [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=40.64s)]
*  by some lunatic wearing a hoodie. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=42.9s)]
*  And yet somehow, none of the many surveillance cameras [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=45.24s)]
*  in the subway station happened to be working at the time [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=48.58s)]
*  so the guy got away. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=51.68s)]
*  We do know he was not a white supremacist, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=53.78s)]
*  so we're betting the media are not going to dwell on this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  There's nothing to gain from covering [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=57.98s)]
*  this particular atrocity, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=59.48s)]
*  just another mass shooting in a big city. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=60.779999999999994s)]
*  It's also sad. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=63.64s)]
*  But mayhem and economic decline are not for once [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=65.08s)]
*  what we are opening the show with tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=68.24s)]
*  No, we have genuinely good news. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  And here it is. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=72.78s)]
*  It looks possible that Elon Musk will seize control [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=73.62s)]
*  of Twitter and end censorship on that platform. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, why should you care about that? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  It's like a tech story, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=80.28s)]
*  Who cares about social media? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=81.52s)]
*  Here's why you should care. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=82.72s)]
*  Because if that were to happen, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=83.84s)]
*  we could see a return of free speech to the United States [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=85.78s)]
*  and nothing should give you more hope than that possibility. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=89.58s)]
*  A free Twitter would mean an open debate about ideas [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=92.98s)]
*  on the single most important incubator [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=96.54s)]
*  of elite opinion in the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=98.58s)]
*  It would mean a return to free and fair elections [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=101.02s)]
*  in the United States, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=103.38s)]
*  a system in which both sides are allowed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=104.48s)]
*  to make their case to the public [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  and then the public can decide. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=107.84s)]
*  It's called democracy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  And above all, a free Twitter would mean a direct challenge [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=110.62s)]
*  to the people in charge of our country's institutions, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=114.18s)]
*  many of whom are incompetent. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  For the first time in years, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  we will be able to talk honestly about our leaders. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  We'll be able to have the kind of conversations [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=122.72000000000001s)]
*  that make democracy possible. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=124.62s)]
*  We can't have those conversations now [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=126.28s)]
*  and there's a reason for it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=128.28s)]
*  The point of censorship is never to shield the weak, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=130.08s)]
*  no matter what Barack Obama may tell you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=133.28s)]
*  The point of censorship always and everywhere [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=135.72s)]
*  is to protect entrenched power. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=139.12s)]
*  That's why it's the powerful who impose censorship [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=141.72s)]
*  for their own benefit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=144.48s)]
*  And that's exactly why illegitimate regimes fight so hard [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=146.12s)]
*  to control information through censorship. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=149.26s)]
*  That's their main concern. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=151.62s)]
*  Why are they so focused on that? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=152.62s)]
*  That's why. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=154.02s)]
*  Somehow the right does not seem to understand this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=155.66s)]
*  The left definitely understands it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=157.98s)]
*  Watch this MSNBC anchor appear to realize in real time [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=160.42s)]
*  what it would mean if the Democratic Party's donor base [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=163.88s)]
*  ever lost control of an influential social media platform. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=166.86s)]
*  And the bigger question on everyone's mind now, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=172.28s)]
*  will Musk's newfound Twitter power mean Trump [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=175.08s)]
*  will be back on the platform? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=178.62s)]
*  And on that possibly nightmare inducing note, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=181.32s)]
*  I wish you a good night. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=184.96s)]
*  It would be a nightmare, she tells us, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=187.92s)]
*  if a democratically elected president [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=190.22s)]
*  were allowed to speak in public. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=192.12s)]
*  And in some ways she's right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=194.38s)]
*  Shattering its monopoly on speech [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=196.26s)]
*  could break the Democratic Party. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=198.66s)]
*  Even an MSNBC anchor understands that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=201.06s)]
*  Why are they so determined to keep you from talking? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=204.12s)]
*  Because they know your talking is the threat to their power. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  Allowing the free exchange of ideas [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=210.12s)]
*  in America's public square is far more important [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  than any single election result. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  And if you don't believe it, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=217.9s)]
*  consider what we've just seen over the past two years. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=219.02s)]
*  You can elect Donald Trump if you want, go ahead and do it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=221.06s)]
*  But the Democratic Party can still silence [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=223.76s)]
*  Donald Trump at will. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=225.66s)]
*  So what does that tell you? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=227.96s)]
*  Who's more powerful, voters or the social media companies [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=229.12s)]
*  that control what voters know? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=233.12s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=235.66s)]
*  Republicans in Congress pretend not to understand this. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=237.68s)]
*  Maybe they really are that stupid. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Possible, doesn't matter because either way [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=241.28s)]
*  they will never fix it, ever. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=243.38s)]
*  They've had a chance, they passed. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=245.56s)]
*  Even Jack Dorsey, who created Twitter, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=247.52s)]
*  could not end censorship on Twitter. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=250.22s)]
*  And so in the end, Jack Dorsey fled his own company [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=252.78s)]
*  when it became a Frankenstein monster [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  that made America more hierarchical rather than less, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=257.86s)]
*  a company that served the powerful [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=260.82s)]
*  at the expense of everyone else. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  That was the opposite of the intended effect. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  So he just left, he had no choice. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=266.62s)]
*  Elon Musk, virtually alone in the entire technology industry [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=269.62s)]
*  appears to understand what exactly is happening here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=273.62s)]
*  Here's Musk in 2018 appearing on 60 Minutes, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=276.22s)]
*  acknowledging that in a world of corporate media, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=279.7s)]
*  Twitter can act as an equalizer. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=282.1s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=284.56s)]
*  You tweet a lot. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=286.2s)]
*  I use my tweets to express myself. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  Some people use their hair. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=290.86s)]
*  I use Twitter. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=292.32s)]
*  Well, but you use your tweeting [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  to kind of get back at critics. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=295.09999999999997s)]
*  Rarely. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=298.0s)]
*  You kind of have little wars with the press. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=298.82s)]
*  Twitter's a war zone. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  If somebody's gonna jump in the war zone, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=302.32s)]

*  Okay, who does that sound like? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=307.82s)]
*  I don't know, who does it sound like? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=311.12s)]
*  It sounds like a guy who lives at the White House. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=311.96s)]
*  Oh, that guy, yeah, sure. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=314.42s)]
*  He's very good at Twitter. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=316.36s)]
*  Twitter is a war zone. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=318.56s)]
*  Now, that tape is from three and a half years ago. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=320.42s)]
*  Twitter is no longer a war zone. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=322.4s)]
*  There's only one army on the field. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump has been banned for Twitter, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=326.4s)]
*  despite the fact he may run in the next presidential race. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=328.26s)]
*  He's an active politician with millions of people [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  who would support him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=333.3s)]
*  He's been banned. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=334.12s)]
*  Charlie Kirk had a huge following on Twitter. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  He's been suspended too. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=337.06s)]
*  So has the Babylonian. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=338.4s)]
*  For that matter, this show has been suspended. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=339.32s)]
*  Questioning a prevailing storyline is the crime. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=341.4s)]
*  Do that and you're gone. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=344.86s)]

*  We were factually right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=347.4s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  Challenge power and you are censored instantly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=349.94s)]
*  Now, it's hard to believe that the world's richest man [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=353.64s)]
*  is the only person who could fix this. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=356.5s)]
*  You'd like to think our democratic systems could fix it, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=358.2s)]
*  but clearly they can't. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=360.76s)]
*  So Elon Musk seems to be our last hope. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=362.14s)]
*  And tonight there are signs that Elon Musk plans [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=365.06s)]
*  to do something big with Twitter. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=367.23999999999995s)]
*  Buying 9% of the company was clearly more [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=369.23999999999995s)]
*  than an investment. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=371.14s)]
*  He doesn't need the money. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  Last week, after Musk became Twitter's single biggest [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  Twitter's management announced that he would join [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=376.74s)]
*  their board of directors. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=378.44s)]
*  The seat would come with two major restrictions. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=379.8s)]
*  First, Musk would be barred from owning more [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=382.0s)]
*  than 15% of Twitter stock. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=384.09999999999997s)]
*  He would not be allowed to control the company. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=385.74s)]
*  Second, as a board member, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=387.74s)]
*  Elon Musk would have a fiduciary duty to shareholders. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=389.24s)]
*  And in real terms, that means he could not reveal [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=392.4s)]
*  Twitter's algorithms. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=394.64s)]
*  He couldn't tell the public what they are. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=395.86s)]
*  Now those algorithms are used to censor and suppress [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=397.5s)]
*  effective critics of the Biden administration very often [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=401.2s)]
*  without their knowledge. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=403.74s)]
*  That's done in secret. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=404.56s)]
*  You can't fight back. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=405.4s)]
*  You don't even know what's happening. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=406.32s)]
*  So he could not challenge that if he took a board seat. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=408.66s)]
*  But this weekend, Musk abruptly pulled out of the deal. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=411.36s)]
*  And that means he's free to buy more shares of Twitter. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=415.12s)]
*  In fact, to control it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=417.56s)]
*  On Sunday night, Twitter's pro censorship CEO, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=419.76s)]
*  Praag Agarwal, told Twitter employees to brace [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=422.16s)]
*  for Musk's attempt at a hostile takeover. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=425.3s)]
*  He also strongly implied that Twitter [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=427.86s)]
*  will not submit unless forced. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=430.7s)]
*  Quote, there will be distractions ahead, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=433.1s)]
*  but our goals and priorities remain unchanged. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself, how exactly would Twitter, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=439.3s)]
*  which is a public company, fight off a hostile takeover [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=441.44s)]
*  from the richest guy in the world? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=444.76000000000005s)]
*  And already you can see the strategy [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=446.54s)]
*  to keep Elon Musk at bay. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=448.3s)]
*  First, Twitter is enlisting the help of corporate media. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=450.3s)]
*  Now corporate media stands to lose at least as much [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=452.54s)]
*  as the Democratic Party will lose if Twitter is liberated. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=455.16s)]
*  Competition is terrible for the mediocre [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  and the illegitimate. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  So MSNBC understands this intuitively, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=461.96s)]
*  even the airheads who read the scripts on the air. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=464.0s)]
*  And so they were the first to answer the call. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=465.76s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  You know exactly what they did. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=469.0s)]
*  They did what they always do. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=470.06s)]
*  They called Elon Musk a racist. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=473.5s)]
*  Fear not, right wingers. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=474.32s)]
*  Another bro fascist is waiting in the wings [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=475.4s)]
*  to defend your right to spew bile online [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=477.79999999999995s)]
*  in the name of free speech. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=480.46s)]
*  And that is coming up next. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=482.0s)]
*  He is building in Tesla a documentedly racist company [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=483.85999999999996s)]
*  that perhaps reminds him, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=489.8s)]
*  gives him nostalgic memories of apartheid South Africa [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=491.8s)]
*  where he grew up. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=494.66s)]
*  He's more than that an embodiment of what I would say [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=495.90000000000003s)]
*  is Twitter's biggest strategic problem, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=499.02000000000004s)]
*  which is a hostile, cruel, dangerous online environment, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=501.1s)]
*  especially for women, especially for people of color, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  women of color in particular. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=508.0s)]
*  We can bore you with a rebuttal [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=512.96s)]
*  to the ludicrous explanation you just heard, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=515.16s)]
*  but it's not necessary. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=517.5s)]
*  If you have an IQ above room temperature, you laugh at it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=519.16s)]
*  That's the lowest brow propaganda possible. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=521.46s)]
*  It's all MSNBC is capable of. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=524.1s)]
*  He's a racist, ignore him. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=525.7s)]
*  But at the Washington Post, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=528.4s)]
*  they served up something slightly different, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=529.56s)]
*  a little more stealthy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=531.64s)]
*  They enlisted the former CEO of Reddit, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=532.46s)]
*  an activist mediocrity called Ellen Pow, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=534.6s)]
*  who couldn't manage to actually run Reddit, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=537.26s)]
*  to write an op-ed with this title, quote, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=539.3s)]
*  "'Elon Musk's vision of free speech [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=541.1s)]
*  "'will be bad for Twitter.'" [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=543.04s)]
*  And then the piece contained this line. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=545.6s)]
*  Now, this line doesn't so much reveal [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=547.74s)]
*  a lack of self-awareness as it does commit murder [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=549.3s)]
*  against the entire concept they're trying to support. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=552.1s)]
*  And here's what it is, quote, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=554.18s)]
*  "'Musk's appointment to Twitter's board [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=555.6999999999999s)]

*  "'from controlling our channels of communication.'" [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=561.74s)]
*  Now, once again, this ran in the Washington Post, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=565.08s)]
*  a paper that apparently, unbeknownst to the editors [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=568.7s)]

*  Jeff Bezos, China's biggest retailer, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=573.78s)]

*  to lobby the federal government and settle scores. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=579.18s)]

*  And if you think that's hilarious, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=598.8199999999999s)]
*  you should read the piece in The Guardian. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=600.14s)]

*  That's kind of the way dictatorships work, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=632.22s)]
*  isn't that right, Robert Reich? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=634.2600000000001s)]
*  The funny thing is, Robert Reich is a lifelong leftist [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=636.6600000000001s)]
*  now pushing 80. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=638.86s)]
*  You can imagine the Robert Reich of, say, 1970, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=640.1800000000001s)]
*  when he was a little college advocate, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=643.32s)]
*  would be a little bit surprised to see the Robert Reich [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=645.72s)]
*  of nearly 80 calling for a total crackdown [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=648.6600000000001s)]
*  on the opinions of ordinary people. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=651.12s)]
*  But you know, people get power and they change. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=652.5200000000001s)]
*  But that doesn't make any sense as an argument. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=656.0600000000001s)]
*  You can see why they stick to calling Elon Musk [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=657.46s)]
*  a racist on cable news. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=659.76s)]
*  They just stick to the same old script. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  And that's what they're doing at CNN. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  Of course, watch. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=665.1s)]
*  I think in some ways it's a good thing [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=667.5s)]
*  that Elon is out there tweeting, livening up Twitter, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=669.1s)]
*  making it more entertaining. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=671.5600000000001s)]
*  As Kara said, he's a funny guy, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  but there are serious questions behind that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=674.9000000000001s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=677.0600000000001s)]
*  Does he push for a full acquisition? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=678.1600000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=680.2s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe he's just in it for the lulls, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=681.02s)]
*  but some of the memes he posts on Twitter, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=682.5s)]
*  anti-trans memes, anti-COVID vaccine memes, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=684.32s)]
*  there's a reason to be skeptical, I think, here. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=688.26s)]
*  Go anti-COVID, use it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=690.26s)]
*  He has questions about the mandatory COVID vaccine. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=691.82s)]
*  Crush him. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=695.16s)]
*  No one's won over by this. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=697.12s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=698.22s)]
*  So clearly that propaganda strategy [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=699.9s)]
*  will not win open minds to the side of censorship. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  In fact, it's impossible to win open minds [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=705.16s)]
*  to the side of censorship [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=707.2s)]
*  because the idea is repugnant to any free spirit. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=708.42s)]
*  So there's other tools that Twitter's gonna have to use [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=712.16s)]
*  to stop a hostile takeover on behalf of free speech. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=714.52s)]
*  So for example, it's virtually certain [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=718.26s)]
*  that Twitter's on the phone now [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=719.5799999999999s)]
*  with corporate lawyers in New York, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=720.72s)]
*  finding ways to use what's known as a poison pill strategy [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=722.02s)]
*  to minimize Elon Musk's ownership stake [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=724.92s)]
*  as much as it possibly can. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=727.12s)]
*  One option, and this would be really interesting, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=728.78s)]
*  is to give Twitter shareholders [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=732.06s)]
*  the ability to buy many more shares at a discount [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=733.48s)]
*  to dilute Musk's control over the company. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=735.72s)]
*  But that strategy's not guaranteed to work. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=738.42s)]
*  Musk himself has a ton of options [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=740.06s)]
*  aside from buying all the shares he wants. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=741.52s)]
*  For example, and you might think of this, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=743.82s)]
*  Elon Musk could enlist the public, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=746.2800000000001s)]
*  the pro-free speech public, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=748.72s)]
*  in his hostile takeover of Twitter. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=750.86s)]
*  So anyone who is against censorship [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=753.2800000000001s)]
*  could buy Twitter stock [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=755.36s)]
*  and then pledge his or her proxy votes to Elon Musk. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=757.1600000000001s)]
*  And that would give him control of the company [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=761.48s)]
*  and the company would be free. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=764.36s)]
*  That would also be the single most revolutionary event [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=765.48s)]
*  ever to take place in the history of finance. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=768.1800000000001s)]
*  It'd be pretty thrilling to watch, and it might work. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=770.86s)]
*  Maybe we'll try it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxGp7qN_YE4&t=772.68s)]
