# Tucker: Political candidates have to be allowed to speak in public
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do)
*  In Florida last night, Donald Trump announced that he is running for president again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=0.0s)]
*  If you've been following his rallies that he has done around the country for the last [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=4.84s)]
*  couple of years, some of it seemed familiar. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=8.24s)]
*  But there were parts of the speech where he offered solutions to problems that you haven't [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=11.26s)]
*  heard before and that nobody seems to be talking about, at least in the way that he spoke about [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  last night. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  The fentanyl crisis, for example. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  He offered a plan to fix it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=21.88s)]
*  He said he would wage war on the Mexican drug cartels and institute the death penalty for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=23.2s)]
*  people who deal fentanyl. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=27.9s)]
*  We will wage war upon the cartels and stop the fentanyl and deadly drugs from killing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=30.74s)]
*  200,000 Americans per year. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=35.94s)]
*  And I will ask Congress for legislation ensuring that drug dealers and human traffickers, these [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=42.06s)]
*  are terrible, terrible, horrible people, who are responsible for death, carnage, and crime [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=47.82s)]
*  all over our country. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=56.62s)]
*  Every drug dealer during his or her life on average will kill 500 people with the drugs [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=58.78s)]
*  they sell, not to mention the destruction of families. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=66.7s)]
*  But we're going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught selling drugs, to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=72.26s)]
*  receive the death penalty for their heinous acts. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=77.9s)]
*  Now, that's an interesting idea. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  You may like it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=84.06s)]
*  You may not like it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=85.34s)]
*  By the way, you may like Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=86.34s)]
*  You may not like Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=88.10000000000001s)]
*  You could be a Democrat who lives to despise him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  You could be a Republican who prefers Ron DeSantis. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  There are many of both of those categories. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=93.58s)]
*  You may be someone who loves him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't really matter what you think of Trump or his policies on fentanyl or anything [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=96.02000000000001s)]
*  else. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=101.06s)]
*  If you're an American, you have to acknowledge that in order for our democracy to function, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=102.06s)]
*  candidates for office, political candidates, have to be allowed to speak in public. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=107.22s)]
*  If they can't speak in public, this can't be a democracy by definition. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=111.42s)]
*  And yet here you have Twitter banning Trump. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=114.86s)]
*  He's still banned despite Elon Musk's takeover. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=118.3s)]
*  Trump is still banned from Twitter tonight, one of our premier social media platforms. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=121.54s)]
*  Parler, you'll remember, was pulled off the internet for giving Donald Trump an account. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=125.98s)]
*  Now, at the time, people read those as offenses against Trump. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=129.74s)]
*  We're sick of Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=133.34s)]
*  Make him shut up. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=134.34s)]
*  But they're more than that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=135.5s)]
*  They're attacks on our system. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=136.5s)]
*  They're attacks on democracy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=138.18s)]
*  They're attacks on the possibility of a free society. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=139.58s)]
*  So you have to wonder now, where are the defenders of democracy? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=142.26000000000002s)]
*  People were yelling last week about democracies dying. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=147.34s)]
*  If they're not calling for Trump to be replatformed, you will know for certain they're not defenders [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=150.34s)]
*  of democracy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=153.9s)]
*  They're totalitarians. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRlAnuz3Do&t=154.9s)]
