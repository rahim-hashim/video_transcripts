# Tucker Carlson: MSNBC's open race hate should worry you deeply
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight in July of 1993 a radio station on Kilgali, Rwanda [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=0.0s)]
*  Began openly attacking one of the country's main ethnic groups the Tutsis the radio station was called RTLM [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=7.16s)]
*  But many remember it as simply who to radio because its audience was primarily who to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  According to who to radio Tutsi people were responsible for virtually every bad thing that ever happened in Rwanda [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=19.84s)]
*  Tutsis had way too much money. They had way too much power Tutsis were way too privileged. They were greedy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  They were bigoted. They were racists. They were dangerous [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=32.64s)]
*  Everything about Tutsi Ness was repulsive [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=36.8s)]
*  For the most part actual Tutsis in Rwanda ignored all of this who to radio was not aimed at them [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=40.52s)]
*  but then in July of 1994 just nine months after RTLM went on the air a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=46.96s)]
*  Genocide began in Rwanda more than half a million Tutsis were murdered in many cases by Hutus [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=53.28s)]
*  Whose rage had been stoked to violence by RTLM broadcasts? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=59.4s)]
*  Entire Tutsi families were dragged from their homes and hacked to death with machetes [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=64.28s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of women were raped [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=69.08s)]
*  The world watched in horror as it happened, but did nothing to intervene instead our leaders told us at the time [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  The genocide in Rwanda would live forever as a lesson to the rest of us [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=78.18s)]
*  about the capacity for evil that lurks inside every human heart and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=82.86s)]
*  The dangers of reducing our neighbors to the sum total of their ethnicity their individuals not ethnic groups [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  Bill Clinton gave an eloquent speech actually on the subject in Kilgally back in 1998 [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=93.86s)]
*  Look it up and ask yourself as you read it if any Democratic Party official could today say those same words [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=98.34s)]
*  It's hard to imagine given what plays on a loop on that party's cable news arm MSNBC [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=106.62s)]
*  Have you watched MSNBC lately? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  Likely you haven't like the Tutsis. You're not the target audience, but you should tune in sometime [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=115.94s)]
*  It's remarkable given that opposing racism is America's national religion [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=121.06s)]
*  It may surprise you to learn that open race hate forms much of the substance of that channel's programming [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=126.54s)]
*  And when we say race hate we're not referring to the subtle coded variety you want border security [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=132.26s)]
*  You're giving your kids piano lessons. You like Shakespeare you believe in the SAT. You must be a racist [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=138.02s)]
*  That's not what we're talking about [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=144.54s)]
*  We're talking about the kind of race hate you cannot mistake for anything else the kind of people just come out and announce [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=146.34s)]
*  I hate this race of people and here's why I do [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=151.5s)]
*  It's hard to believe that anything like that is happening right now on American television, but it is out in the open [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=155.82s)]
*  And the most amazing and the most creepy part of all is that no one is saying anything about it [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=161.82s)]
*  It's all but ignored and honestly we had no idea it was going on either until we started getting texts from people [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=167.5s)]
*  Are you watching this? Can you believe this? So we tuned in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=171.98s)]
*  Apparently on the left what you're about to see is considered completely normal even good and that should worry you deeply [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=176.9s)]
*  You don't want to live in Rwanda [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=183.94s)]
*  But an MSNBC they're already there now you probably knew about Joy Reed the race lady who's been fixated on race hate for years now [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=185.98s)]
*  But MSNBC has a new host someone called Tiffany Cross who hosts a show called the cross connection. Here's a selection [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=193.98s)]
*  Many of us have seen the dangers when powerful white people decide they won something [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=201.92s)]
*  They annex it and they've never had a problem replacing the people who stand in their way [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=205.7s)]
*  We see American white people are going crazy [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=210.34s)]
*  They're going they're resorting to violence. This is literally what conservative white folks do when they don't get their way [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=214.1s)]
*  They turn violent white people [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=220.96s)]
*  Deputizing themselves in some position of authority to have jurisdiction over their life when they need to mind their blinking business [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=223.22s)]
*  I don't think it's our responsibility to be tasked with [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=230.94s)]
*  destroying and dismantling the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=235.26s)]
*  Racial oppression that's against us [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=237.9s)]
*  That's just saying we're more at fault than the white people who constructed this system and the white people who continue to practice [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=239.82s)]
*  Institutional racism a majority of white people do not support policies that would unpack and unroll and reform this system of justice [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=245.78s)]
*  This is what they want. Matt Gaetz is giving the white folks what they want [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=253.62s)]
*  White replacement can strangle culture. So yes, we should all be concerned about white replacement [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=259.22s)]
*  It is after all a very threat to our survival here [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=264.98s)]
*  Is there anything worse than white people they're violent they're heartless they're cruel they're deranged [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=269.62s)]
*  They're secretive. They're dishonest [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=276.9s)]
*  In fact, as you just heard Tiffany Cross say white people are a mortal danger to you and your loved ones [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=279.54s)]
*  They threaten your life [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=285.46s)]
*  Are they poisoning the wells? Are they baking bread with the blood of your children? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=287.06s)]
*  If not, according to Tiffany Cross and MSNBC, they're fully capable of doing those things. They've certainly done worse [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=291.22s)]
*  This is Hutu radio [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=298.42s)]
*  But it's not an independent radio station in African country [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=301.22s)]
*  It's part of one of the biggest news organizations in the world [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=304.18s)]
*  Part of the biggest telecommunications company in the United States Comcast which owns it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself what does Comcast board think of this? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  Comcast board is mostly white people white people who according to the channel they own [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=317.3s)]
*  Decided they wanted something then they annexed it white people who steal because they're white [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=323.3s)]
*  White people who could quote turn to violence where they don't get their way [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=327.14s)]
*  White people are going crazy endangering their communities [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=331.38s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself why are they putting this on the air? Why are they allowing this? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=335.7s)]
*  This is not a policy debate [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=341.38s)]
*  These are open attacks on people on Americans on the basis purely of their race and that's just a selection [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=343.3s)]
*  We could go on and on and on [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=350.1s)]
*  Are they aware that this is happening? Perhaps they're not we weren't to be fair [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=352.74s)]
*  But it is happening day after day after day after day [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=357.38s)]
*  And a certain point you have to ask yourself [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=361.86s)]
*  If it continues and nobody stops it [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=364.34s)]
*  Do they agree with it? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=367.22s)]
*  Maybe they do and just in case you think that we are taking Tiffany cross out of context [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=368.9s)]
*  And pulling the worst quotes from a out of context segment to make her seem crazy and racist [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=374.42s)]
*  Here's more here's Tiffany cross and msnbc [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=381.54s)]
*  Look a lot of folks in that capital insurrection [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=384.82s)]
*  Some of these folks were white women and I know we're talking a lot about oath keepers and proud boys [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=387.94s)]
*  But I do think that some of the white women who adopted adopted this ideology [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  Is america ready to face the fact that some of those folks look like people they have elevated and put on a pedestal of being untouchable [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=397.14s)]
*  What do you say about this wing of of white women who have been radicalized and are enablers? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=404.98s)]
*  To this very dangerous domestic terrorism movement that we've seen increase quite rapidly [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=411.46s)]
*  So it's not just whites it's white women their women are bad, too [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=417.94s)]
*  Women, of course are the key to reproducing the white race, which is clearly a threat as she says again and again [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=423.22s)]
*  To you and your family. They're dangerous. They want to hurt you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=429.46s)]
*  Now don't be fooled by the fact that tiffany cross can barely speak a coherent sentence. She was a communications major [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  Apparently according to the internet that didn't work [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  But the gist of it is very very clear [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=444.02s)]
*  white women are dangerous because white people are dangerous they are [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=447.38s)]
*  by the nature of their dna potential domestic terrorists [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=452.9s)]
*  Now you can play the game. Well, if any other group were spoken about this way, this would be shut down immediately [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=457.3s)]
*  And of course, that's completely true. There's no other group in america [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=462.98s)]
*  You could talk about the way that tiffany cross and joy reed and other anchors and msnbc talk about white people [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=465.7s)]
*  But you don't even have to play that game. It doesn't matter what the color is. It's always wrong to reduce people [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=471.94s)]
*  To the color of their skin to their melanin content to their dna [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=478.18s)]
*  And it's even worse to attack them on the basis of that and in fact, it's the basis of violence actual violence [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=481.78s)]
*  actual violence [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=488.41999999999996s)]
*  But tiffany cross can't be criticized because she's oppressed. That's the key watch this [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=490.41999999999996s)]
*  What we didn't see were enough voices willing to point out the deeper festering rot that's plagued this nation since it was born [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=495.3s)]
*  People who neither discovered nor built this land have been led to believe that america is theirs and theirs alone [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=502.98s)]
*  Will this democracy survive? Well a yahoo news poll says no [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=509.70000000000005s)]
*  But perhaps when you build a nation on stolen land with stolen labor, it was never going to be a republic we could keep [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=514.1800000000001s)]
*  And so here we are celebrating the birth of a nation [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=520.5s)]
*  independence for white men [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=524.64s)]
*  Okay [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=528.9799999999999s)]
*  once again [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=530.18s)]
*  Calling out a specific race by name now. You have to wonder about the other anchors on msnbc [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=531.9399999999999s)]
*  msnbc some of whom are that race do they notice this [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=537.6999999999999s)]
*  Do they know what's happening on their channel? Are they okay with this? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=541.14s)]
*  What do you think happens if we continue to talk this way? You may not watch that channel, but some people do [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=543.8599999999999s)]
*  What does this look like in a year or five years or ten years? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=551.14s)]
*  What kind of country do you live in? Well a country at war with itself race war? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=554.7399999999999s)]
*  This woman tiffany cross whose clips you've been watching [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=560.5s)]
*  Is so deranged by a racialist [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=564.26s)]
*  worldview [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=567.8599999999999s)]
*  that she believes [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=568.9s)]
*  All people of one color are oppressed by all people of another color and to prove it she says even [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=570.9s)]
*  NFL players [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=577.38s)]
*  Some of the richest people in our society some of the most celebrated the most famous the most privileged [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=579.22s)]
*  Even they can't escape [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=584.58s)]
*  The all-pervasive hatred of diabolical whites watch this [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=587.62s)]
*  I gotta say mike the optics just look bad to see all these black men crashing into each other [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=592.8199999999999s)]
*  With a bunch of white owners white coaches and the complete disregard of black bodies and black life [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=597.62s)]
*  I mean it just represents a larger issue [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=602.66s)]
*  So, I mean [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=605.2199999999999s)]
*  Look the average salary for an nfl player is more than two million dollars a year [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=608.02s)]
*  60 percent of nfl players are african-americans in some positions like cornerback virtually all the first string players are black [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=612.5799999999999s)]
*  so [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=619.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=621.06s)]
*  We don't have a problem with that. Most people don't have a problem with that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=622.3399999999999s)]
*  But if you look at that picture and say this is white supremacy [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=625.4599999999999s)]
*  What are you really saying? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=630.42s)]
*  You're saying that anybody involved in the sport who is white defiles the sport because whiteness is itself [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=632.18s)]
*  inherently corrupting white people are so evil that their mere presence in a sport that is overwhelmingly african-american and from which african-american individuals are benefiting [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=639.68s)]
*  Is enough to destroy the whole operation [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=648.5s)]
*  Because they're whites involved [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  What kind of talk is that? Well, it's genocidal talk actually not an overstatement. That's exactly what it is [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=652.66s)]
*  So again, you have to wonder what does comcast board think of this? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=657.54s)]
*  It's not a rhetorical question really now that we're talking about sports because comcast also owns an nhl team a hockey team the philadelphia fliers [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=661.2199999999999s)]
*  And maybe not surprisingly the nhl just published its first ever diversity report [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=668.26s)]
*  And according to that report we have a huge problem with hockey and the problem is there are too many white people in hockey [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=672.66s)]
*  Now, why is that a problem? No one actually explains. It doesn't need to be explained [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=678.5799999999999s)]
*  Because it's just prima facie obvious. We've got a lot of white people [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=683.6999999999999s)]
*  That's inherently bad because white people are inherently bad again. Do you want to live in a country where powerful people talk this way? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=686.66s)]
*  What do you think it looks like in five years? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=692.26s)]
*  the head of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=695.6999999999999s)]
*  the nhl's quote social impact [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=697.14s)]
*  Division said quote. We have a lot of work to do [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=700.8199999999999s)]
*  Again, how does comcast board feel about this? Will the board undergo some kind of forced diversification? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=705.86s)]
*  What about the nba and the nfl? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=711.3s)]
*  Immediately we're not following all of this but as joy reading tiffany cross tell us that's probably because we're white and too stupid to understand [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=713.14s)]
*  I think for kamala harris. She's had like [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=721.54s)]
*  The triple problem of being a woman and so people not being willing to respect her the way they would respect a male vice president [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=724.3399999999999s)]
*  Of being black which we already know that what that carries with it is the anti-blackness comes, you know with the package [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=730.5799999999999s)]
*  And then also being vice president at a time that is really really difficult [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=736.5799999999999s)]
*  Joy and I talk about this all the time madam vice president and you know this charlie. She black black [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=740.58s)]
*  Okay, she went to howard. She aka and when she talks to you. Yeah, it is. I mean she sounds so regular [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=745.06s)]
*  She's so regular and approachable and I just it's unfortunate that more people don't see that [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=750.26s)]
*  And there's also just the dumbing down of the american electorate [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=754.74s)]
*  We could go on and on [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=758.42s)]
*  We could read excerpts from tiffany cross's book which are brimming with racial hostility [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=760.42s)]
*  We could play you a million clips from joy reed which are exactly the same filled with open racial hostility [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=765.54s)]
*  But you get the point and if you don't believe it just go ahead and tune into msnbc [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=772.02s)]
*  But it's not really about that channel or those hosts [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=775.38s)]
*  It's about a society that thinks that's okay [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=779.22s)]
*  Where it's not really about diversity [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=783.62s)]
*  It's about hating other people on the basis of their race and it's a little bewildering to the rest of us [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=785.14s)]
*  Thought the whole point of that of america was that we're aspiring to a country where we are judged [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=789.86s)]
*  By the content of our character not the color of our skin and all of a sudden racial reductionists don't simply have the floor [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=795.54s)]
*  And the platform on cable news shows [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=802.98s)]
*  But have apparently the unquestioning support of the biggest telecommunications company in the united states [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=805.38s)]
*  What does that say about the country and its leadership? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGsZ5I2juA&t=810.58s)]
