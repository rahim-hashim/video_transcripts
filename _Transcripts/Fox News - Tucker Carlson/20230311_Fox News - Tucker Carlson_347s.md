# Jordan Peterson: This is an appalling situation and it will get worse
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs)
*  Environmentalism is supposed to be about protecting the environment, and most people are completely [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=0.0s)]
*  in favor of that, but the environmental movement of today has nothing to do with protecting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=6.84s)]
*  the environment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=11.94s)]
*  They're destroying the environment, killing the California condor with their wind projects [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=12.94s)]
*  and whales and basically wrecking Africa with all the elements needed for their new battery [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=17.12s)]
*  revolution, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=24.2s)]
*  It's not about the environment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  And that's some kind of weird cult around climate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=27.4s)]
*  And who better to assess a cult than Jordan Peterson, who is a famous psychologist and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  author. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=35.199999999999996s)]
*  We asked him about what is happening recently. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=36.64s)]
*  Here's the conversation that resulted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=39.08s)]
*  Jordan Peterson, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=40.92s)]
*  Just to begin with the premise that the modern environmental movement doesn't seem to be [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=46.08s)]
*  doing a lot for the actual environment, it's my observation, what do you think that's about? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  Well, I think the best example of that's probably both Sri Lanka and Germany. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  I mean, Sri Lanka is an absolute wasteland at the moment as a direct consequence of idiot [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=60.44s)]
*  hypothetically environmentalist policies. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=67.44s)]
*  And then in Germany, energy is much more expensive than it was. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=69.72s)]
*  It's much more unreliable than it was. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=73.44s)]
*  The Germans are dangerously dependent on dictators and the Russians. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=76.16s)]
*  And that's all a consequence of hypothetical environmentalist policies. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=81.24s)]
*  So even by the standards laid down by the environmentalists themselves, the policies [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=85.24s)]
*  that were put in place that were pro-environmental are failing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=91.72s)]
*  But there's something that's even deeper lying underneath the surface. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  Alex Epstein has made a fair bit of this in his new book, Fossil Future, but I started [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  delving into this, I guess, 30 years ago when I wrote my first book, Maps of Meaning. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=105.28s)]
*  So Tucker, it's become pretty clear recently as a consequence of converging evidence from [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=109.84s)]
*  a lot of different disciplines, neuroscience, artificial intelligence and literary criticism, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=115.16s)]
*  odd bedfellows, by the way. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=120.8s)]
*  And there's more scientific and humanities endeavours involved in this convergence than [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=122.32s)]
*  those that the structure through which we see the world is essentially a narrative, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=127.52s)]
*  is a story. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=134.48s)]
*  And so, and in fact, I asked the world's greatest neuroscientist about a month ago on my podcast, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=135.48s)]
*  Carl Friston, if even our object perceptions were micro stories. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=142.0s)]
*  And he said that that was clearly the case. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=146.96s)]
*  And he's speaking as a scientist, by the way. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=148.84s)]
*  And so that begs a question. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=151.36s)]
*  If we see the world through a story, what is that story and what should it be? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=152.96s)]
*  And what are the fundamental elements that the story has to contain? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=159.56s)]
*  And so the environmentalists offer us a story to live by, and it's a pseudo-religious story. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=163.96s)]
*  And it essentially elevates the biosphere, the Earth, Gaia, the Earth goddess, let's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  say, to the status of primary deity and characterizes her as sort of a waif-like, innocent victim, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=177.38s)]
*  easily taken advantage of and fragile. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=184.1s)]
*  It casts the entire human endeavour on the social front as a raping and pillaging, patriarchal [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=186.76s)]
*  monster only interested in power. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  And it casts the individual as like a devouring mouth riding on the back of that giant, essentially. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=197.36s)]
*  And so that's a description of the world. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  And there's some truth to that, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=206.08s)]
*  Because we can wreak environmental havoc. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=208.4s)]
*  Social structures can become power mad and we can be carelessly consumerist. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  But it's a very incomplete story. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=219.36s)]
*  It demonizes in a very pathological manner. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=222.56s)]
*  So when you hear people say things like, human beings are nothing but a cancer on the face [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=225.16s)]
*  of the planet, or there's too many people on the planet for the Earth to feed, let's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=229.5s)]
*  say, then you're seeing reflections of that underlying pseudo-religious narrative. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=235.04s)]
*  And it's extraordinarily dangerous. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=242.2s)]
*  Now the reason that you can see that in some ways it's a religious structure rather than [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=244.0s)]
*  a careful attempt to grapple with the full realities of the world is that it has these [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=250.2s)]
*  odd features. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=257.47999999999996s)]
*  So for example, the environmentalists tend to radically oppose nuclear power and also [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=259.08s)]
*  natural gas. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=265.64s)]
*  And it's clearly the case that there's nothing that reduces carbon production more effectively [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=266.78s)]
*  than nuclear power. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=270.68s)]
*  That's I don't think anybody with any sense ever debates that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's also clearly the case that if we were careful with nuclear power, and we could [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  be because we've been building nuclear plants for a long time, that we could be providing [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=280.5s)]
*  extremely low cost energy to people, especially poor people throughout the world. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=284.58s)]
*  But we are not going to do that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=288.74s)]
*  In fact, we have an anti-energy policy in place, especially in any places that are ruled [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=290.62s)]
*  essentially by the left. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=295.7s)]
*  And the consequence of that is, well, I just saw today UNICEF just released a report showing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=297.5s)]
*  that there's been a 25% increase in the last year and a half in the number of women and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=303.06s)]
*  children that are starving around the world. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=308.62s)]
*  It's a direct consequence of the increase in energy prices, which are in themselves [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=310.26s)]
*  a direct consequence of anti-industrial policies put in place by hypothetically well-meaning, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=315.02s)]
*  deluded pseudo-religious environmental worshipers of the apocalypse. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=321.58s)]
*  It's an appalling situation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=326.94s)]
*  And it's likely to get worse, I would say, before it gets better. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=328.66s)]
*  Not cheery, but probably true. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JDTXzynkrs&t=333.06s)]
