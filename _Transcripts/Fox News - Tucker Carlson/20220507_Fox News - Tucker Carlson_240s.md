# Sexton: Democrats are 'the party of the mob'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI)
*  Buck Sexton remembers very well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the co-host of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=1.7s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=4.04s)]
*  Buck Sexton, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=5.3s)]
*  So when you watch CNN and they tell you that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=6.9s)]
*  because a Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=9.74s)]
*  wrote an opinion that the right likes, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=12.8s)]
*  that the threat of violence comes from the right, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=14.64s)]
*  what's your first reaction to that? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=16.48s)]
*  The Democrat Party is wallowing in its delusions at this point. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't know how to get out of them, quite honestly. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the notion that there might be right-wing violence [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=25.22s)]
*  in response to a decision that the right overwhelmingly likes [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=28.8s)]
*  makes absolutely no sense. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=32.28s)]
*  And beyond that, let's think about who we're really talking [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  about here with the pro-life movement. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=35.72s)]
*  Those aren't tiny Molotov cocktails they're holding [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=37.52s)]
*  when they hold vigils, they're candles. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=40.72s)]
*  I mean, these are people who overwhelmingly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  in the pro-life movement want to protect life [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=44.08s)]
*  and protect people and are orderly. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=46.52s)]
*  But the Democrat Party has never actually had a reckoning [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=48.72s)]
*  with the fact that there was a longstanding insurrection [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=51.66s)]
*  in the year 2020 and it was BLM and Antifa. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=55.34s)]
*  And it was egged on by people in the press. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=59.4s)]
*  There was mass looting and mass hysteria [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=61.2s)]
*  in cities across the country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=63.2s)]
*  They've never even had a moment of introspection about this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=64.8s)]
*  And now they want to lecture us about lawlessness [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=68.4s)]
*  in the aftermath of a decision [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  that actually goes against them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=71.72s)]
*  But Tucker, if you're willing to believe [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=73.58s)]
*  that there's a right to abortion in the Constitution, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=74.98s)]
*  you are willing to believe absolutely anything. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=77.72s)]
*  And that's where the left is right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  But it's like this with everything. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is the way they communicate. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  And it seems to me that people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=85.6s)]
*  who are not passive aggressive miss it every time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=86.82s)]
*  They say things like, you're violent [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=90.36s)]
*  as they burn your cities, as you just pointed out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=92.36s)]
*  We're not letting your kids into college [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  because of their skin color and you're a racist. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=97.06s)]
*  I'm the racist. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=99.3s)]
*  Everything is like this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=100.34s)]
*  I can't remember an issue on which liberals [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=102.7s)]
*  flatly declared their intent [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=105.64s)]
*  and then backed it up with evidence. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=107.78s)]
*  Well, in this case, I think that there's some degree [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=110.74s)]
*  of political insurance that they're trying [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  to put forward here by making it seem like, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=115.08s)]
*  well, if things do get really ugly, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=117.64s)]
*  and Tucker, I think they probably will. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=119.42s)]
*  I mean, hopefully that won't happen. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=121.22s)]
*  But with riots and protests, they'll make it seem like, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=122.56s)]
*  well, there are provocateurs on both sides of this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=125.42s)]
*  Because I do think that people have started [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=127.8s)]
*  to figure out more and more as the miracle [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=130.6s)]
*  of the unifying Biden presidency and the adults in charge [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=133.1s)]
*  hasn't really taken the way that they promised [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=136.5s)]
*  that the Democrats, the left, they are the riot party. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=139.18s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=142.0s)]
*  They are the mob. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  They are the ones that freak out [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  when they don't get their way, throw childish tantrums. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=145.6s)]
*  They don't petition the court. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  They threaten to or try to burn down the court. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  We all see it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=151.78s)]
*  And so by trying to muddy the waters, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=153.18s)]
*  they make themselves feel better about some of the hysteria [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  that you've already shown. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=157.12s)]
*  And God forbid something really bad does happen, they'll say, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=158.32s)]
*  well, it was because of rising temperatures across the board. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, rising temperatures from the Democrat antifilunatics [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=164.02s)]
*  trying to burn things down. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  It's just so bad for everyone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, leaving aside the issue, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=170.06s)]
*  wherever you stand on abortion, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=171.3s)]
*  it is not good for people to threaten Supreme Court justices. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=172.46s)]
*  It's not good to spray paint churches [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=175.7s)]
*  or intimidate people out of going to services on Sunday. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=177.0s)]
*  People are intimidated about going to church [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=179.94s)]
*  this coming Sunday. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=181.64s)]
*  Why doesn't the White House just say, you know, don't do that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=182.7s)]
*  The lack of willingness. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=185.24s)]
*  I mean, this was honestly a little stunning. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=187.48s)]
*  I watched those press conferences a lot with Jen Psaki. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=189.18s)]
*  I watched what they say in this White House. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=191.52s)]
*  The fact that they wouldn't take one moment [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=193.38s)]
*  to establish the most basic principle [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=195.72s)]
*  that our Supreme Court justices, our Supreme Court, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=197.88s)]
*  their safety is inviolate and we have that as nonpartisan. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=200.24s)]
*  This, oh, tensions are really high. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=203.78s)]
*  Don't say something like that when tensions are rising [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=206.24s)]
*  on the left and among Democrats, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=209.28s)]
*  but Jen Psaki doesn't want to upset the Democrat base [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=210.82s)]
*  who are enraged and who are effectively melting down [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=213.42s)]
*  before our very eyes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=215.96s)]
*  And so she won't say what's so obvious, so clear, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=217.32s)]
*  which is if you have any principles [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=219.8s)]
*  about sacred democracy in our institutions, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=221.42s)]
*  you lay off the Supreme Court. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=224.46s)]
*  You don't actually threaten people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=225.86s)]
*  You don't put up their addresses, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=226.94s)]
*  but they are the party of the mob [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=228.86s)]
*  and I don't think they're gonna be able [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=230.94s)]
*  to turn that off anytime soon. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=231.8s)]
*  So there's real reason for concern, unfortunately. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=233.2s)]
*  Yeah, it seems dangerous for sure. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=236.04s)]
*  Buck Sexton, I appreciate it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=238.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5o3-xVGVVI&t=239.08s)]
