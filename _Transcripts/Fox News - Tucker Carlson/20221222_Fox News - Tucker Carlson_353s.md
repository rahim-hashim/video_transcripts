# WWE legend 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan pins home invader
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU)
*  If you watch pro wrestling, you know Jim Duggan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=0.0s)]
*  He is a legend. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=3.7s)]
*  He won the first ever Royal Rumble in WWE history [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=4.66s)]
*  back in 1988. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=8.14s)]
*  So you watch him on TV, you think, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  that man looks pretty tough, but is he really tough? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=10.66s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of an act, right? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  What does he really like? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=15.9s)]
*  Well, now we know. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=16.86s)]
*  Earlier this month, Duggan was with his wife at home [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  in the country in South Carolina. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=21.62s)]
*  They heard a man banging on the door. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=22.94s)]
*  Then the man burst inside Duggan's home, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=24.86s)]
*  said he was trying to hide from other people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  who were trying to kill him. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=29.38s)]
*  So Duggan grabbed the man and threw him back out [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  on the porch and then got his 44 Magnum [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=33.2s)]
*  and waited until police arrived. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=35.16s)]
*  Kind of an amazing story. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  An American defending his home on his own [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=38.0s)]
*  without federal assistance. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=41.76s)]
*  Jim Duggan joins us to go through what happened. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=43.28s)]
*  Jim, I appreciate you're coming on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=45.94s)]
*  Jim, thank you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=46.94s)]
*  So what, I don't know if I characterized [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=47.78s)]
*  that exactly right. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Tell us what happened. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=49.96s)]
*  Tucker, thank you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  My pleasure to be here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=52.44s)]
*  Yeah, but pretty much, you know, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=53.36s)]
*  we live out in the country. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=54.56s)]
*  We're on a dirt road. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  I've got about 10 acres. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=57.4s)]
*  Everything is fenced in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=58.580000000000005s)]
*  We got a big gate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=60.02s)]
*  So we leave the door open. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=61.02s)]
*  Most of them die and they let the dogs [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=62.72s)]
*  and the cats in and out, you know, during the evening. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=64.26s)]
*  So I'm sitting there watching TV. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=66.92s)]
*  All of a sudden, the pounding on the door. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=68.38s)]
*  I jump up. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=70.42s)]
*  As I get to the door, the doors burst open. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=71.26s)]
*  This guy falls in, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=74.14s)]
*  because it was a step to get into my house. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=75.22s)]
*  He falls in. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=77.14s)]
*  I switched back to the old time days. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, ah! [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=80.30000000000001s)]
*  I grab him, I throw him out on the front porch, you know, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=81.74000000000001s)]
*  and I just spread eagle, spread eagle on the porch. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=84.42s)]
*  And I reach in and of all the guns they have inside, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=87.28s)]
*  I use it to scare off the coyotes and foxes [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=90.28s)]
*  from my ducks and chickens. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=92.56s)]
*  It's a .44 Magnum. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=94.28s)]
*  I got the .44 Magnum. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=95.92s)]
*  It's a pretty intimidating gun. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  And I got him down on the ground and spread eagle. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=99.2s)]
*  And he's screaming, help me, help me. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  They're trying to kill me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  So now I'm thinking, well, this is not a Holman invasion. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=105.44s)]
*  Cause I first checked the back door [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=108.2s)]
*  to make sure nobody else was coming in. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=110.0s)]
*  That was my first impression. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  It was a Holman invasion. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=113.30000000000001s)]
*  So I saw nobody else come in and I pushed him down. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=114.62s)]
*  He's screaming, other guys are coming to kill him. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=118.22s)]
*  I can hear people out in the dirt road yelling, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  we're going to get you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=122.38s)]
*  So I had my wife turn off all the Christmas lights, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=123.94s)]
*  you know, where I'm back lit. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=126.5s)]
*  I'm holding them down. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=127.82s)]
*  I got my gun. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=128.7s)]
*  I said, nobody knows we're up here, just be quiet. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=129.76s)]
*  And my wife, God bless, she's on the phone with 911, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=132.26s)]
*  almost hysterics. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=135.54s)]
*  Her blood pressure was way up and she said, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=137.34s)]
*  send the fire department, send the ambulance, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=139.7s)]
*  send everybody. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=141.94s)]
*  So all the Kershaw County Sheriff's Department, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=143.34s)]
*  they were great. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=145.8s)]
*  They responded. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=146.62s)]
*  But I tell you what, Tucker, as quick as it happened, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=147.6s)]
*  it wasn't quick enough. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=151.08s)]
*  People aren't happy to see a cop [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=152.2s)]
*  until you need one, buddy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=154.28s)]
*  And I'm standing there on the porch with a gun in my hand, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=156.08s)]
*  two men out there yelling, I don't know who they are. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=159.04s)]
*  I don't know if they have guns [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=161.7s)]
*  of what this guy brought to my house. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=163.0s)]
*  So I'm waiting for the police. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=165.64s)]
*  I'm waiting for when I first saw those blue lights, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=167.12s)]
*  I was a happy man. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=170.08s)]
*  He must've been a little surprised [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=172.18s)]
*  that he broke into your house, of all people's house. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=173.94s)]
*  Did you ever get the backstory? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  Who was this guy and who were the other people? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=178.61999999999998s)]
*  Well, it comes to find out on our dirt road, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  there's only like five or six houses. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  The guy had a restraining order against him [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=185.54s)]
*  for a young girl at the end of the house, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=187.92s)]
*  or end of the road, excuse me. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=190.04s)]
*  He broke into their house, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  or I guess it was her brother and uncle, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=193.54s)]
*  I don't know what the combination was, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=195.38s)]
*  but two men had pistols. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=196.98s)]
*  They pistol whipped him, chased him down the road. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=198.76s)]
*  Every house he went to, he pounded on the door, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=202.56s)]
*  help, let me in. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=204.76s)]
*  Nobody let him in till he got to my house, our house. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=205.92s)]
*  He climbed over the fence, he lost his shoes, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=209.16s)]
*  broke into the house. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank goodness, Tucker, I didn't have a gun [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=213.6s)]
*  when he first came through, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=215.32s)]
*  because I thought he was an invasion. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  He first came through, I went back to wrestling mode, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  ah, I got him, I threw him out of the house, you know? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=221.32s)]
*  And then I grabbed that big .44 Magnum. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=224.68s)]
*  What are the odds of stumbling into the home [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=228.98s)]
*  of a legendary pro wrestler? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  Probably pretty low, I would think. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=234.94s)]
*  That small little town in South Carolina, too, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=236.54s)]
*  that's one thing with wrestling, you can live anywhere [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  long as you're near a major airport, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=242.1s)]
*  so I use the Charlotte Airport, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=243.82s)]
*  and we love living out in the country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=245.42s)]
*  The girls call it my hobby farm. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=247.66s)]
*  I got ducks and chickens, dogs and cats, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=249.42s)]
*  and so to have someone even make it to the door [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  was a shock, but to have somebody break through the door [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=254.98s)]
*  was a whole different deal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=259.0s)]
*  So for viewers who aren't professional wrestlers, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=260.24s)]
*  no history of it, which is most, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=264.0s)]
*  what would you recommend if someone breaks into your house? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=266.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, first thing, you know, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=271.44s)]
*  that's that fight or flight mode you go into. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  I think some people, which would be the right decision, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=276.2s)]
*  maybe go to a safe room, maybe run to another house, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=279.02s)]
*  go to a neighbor, my first instinct was to attack. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  You gotta do what you feel is properly right, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=286.58s)]
*  but the first thing you gotta do is call the cops. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=289.18s)]
*  Call the police, man, because I tell you, Tucker, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=292.26s)]
*  my heart was pounding through my shirt. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=295.02s)]
*  I got this guy spread-eagled. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=297.0s)]
*  I hear people yelling on this dark road. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=298.74s)]
*  It was a terrifying ordeal, and I'm waiting and waiting [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=302.46s)]
*  and waiting, which probably wasn't that long, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=305.58s)]
*  but all of a sudden you see those blue lights flicker, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=308.02s)]
*  and it was like the cavalry was coming. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=310.14s)]
*  Amazing, amazing, and weirdly amusing and great. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=312.66s)]
*  Jim Duggan, thank you so much for that story, appreciate it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, you know, Tucker, I'm old school wrestling before I go, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  and you might wanna do one with me. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=321.65999999999997s)]
*  Let's go, tough guy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=323.41999999999996s)]
*  Ho! [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=324.94s)]
*  USA! [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=326.94s)]
*  USA! [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=328.7s)]
*  I can't pull it off, but I love that you can. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=334.29999999999995s)]
*  No, I'm gonna do it in private when no one's watching. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0qpAi4mnzU&t=335.29999999999995s)]
