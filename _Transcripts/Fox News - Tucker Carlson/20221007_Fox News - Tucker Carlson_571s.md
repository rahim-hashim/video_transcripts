# Ye on being a Christian in liberal-dominated music and fashion industries
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM)
*  It drove me crazy to not be able to say that I like Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=0.0s)]
*  It drove, because think about it, it's me. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=5.4s)]
*  Imagine me not being able to say what I wanted. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=8.9s)]
*  What was the point of being famous? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=11.3s)]
*  What was the point of having, you know, millions of people [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=13.9s)]
*  love your music? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=16.4s)]
*  What was the point of having a voice if you can't even use your [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=17.2s)]
*  own voice and connect it to your own opinions? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=20.6s)]
*  That's where the disconnect happened. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=23.0s)]
*  That's where the quote, I think wrongly, wrongly diagnosed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=26.099999999999998s)]
*  That's where the bipolarity is because you got something you're [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=34.4s)]
*  thinking, but you're told you're not allowed to say it in public. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=40.2s)]
*  Well, I never actually told people that I like Trump when he [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=46.8s)]
*  was running because I was bullied by Hollywood because I [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=54.1s)]
*  stayed in Hollywood and people are like, think about your kids, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=60.8s)]
*  and I'm trying to hold on to the marriage, so I'm just biting my [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=63.8s)]
*  tongue. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=67.5s)]
*  Like there's so many fathers and mothers that go to work every [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=68.0s)]
*  day and they're in a situation where they're biting their tongue [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=73.0s)]
*  because they think it would be better for their children. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=76.1s)]
*  So even me, in my position, I was biting my tongue on my [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=79.5s)]
*  political opinion because I thought it would be better for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=83.8s)]
*  my children. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=87.3s)]
*  And now you look up and my kids are going to a school that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=88.0s)]
*  teaches black kids a complicated Kwanzaa. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=92.5s)]
*  Kwanzaa doesn't, you know, so they don't teach even Christmas [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=96.1s)]
*  itself, Christ Mass. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=100.8s)]
*  They don't teach it at Sierra Canyon. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=102.1s)]
*  And what they do is take all of the celebrities, the actors, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=104.7s)]
*  the basketball players, and they throw them in this one school [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=108.7s)]
*  and they indoctrinate the kids. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  So my son, Psalm, is brilliant. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  So right now they're looking to figure out how to indoctrinate [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  him to make him be another part of the system. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=123.5s)]
*  I have a choir at my school. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=127.8s)]
*  So right now we've come to a compromise, but I'm not finished [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=130.4s)]
*  because I don't compromise, but we come to a compromise when my [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  kids go to my school after school and they learn choir. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  I sat there with my son and he came and he said, why do I need [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  to sing? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=146.7s)]
*  I don't even go to your school. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=147.2s)]
*  So imagine a 16 year old version of that guy, the 26 year old [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=148.5s)]
*  version of that guy where the father doesn't have say so of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=153.2s)]
*  what the kids are watching, what the kids are wearing, what [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=159.0s)]
*  the kids are eating, who the kids are hanging out with. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=162.5s)]
*  Ray Kurzweil said we have the information needed to have a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  human utopia, but we're led by the least noble, most greedy [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  There's a solution. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  That can bring happiness to so many more people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  I even had this idea about, you know, the connection of Big [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Pharma to farms by having localized farms with more localized [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=186.5s)]
*  farms. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=193.2s)]
*  You can use less pesticides. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  If you have less pesticides, then you have less diseases. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=197.7s)]
*  And have Big Pharma invest in the local farms and they'll [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  actually make more money. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  I'm not one of the people that go up and say, hey, I want to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=212.7s)]
*  stop anybody from making money. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=216.7s)]
*  The people that make money and the powers that be. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=218.2s)]
*  I am your true Nikolai Tesla. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=221.5s)]
*  And I'm not even a scientist. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=226.7s)]
*  What do you think of Elon Musk? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=230.6s)]
*  Do you know him? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=231.9s)]
*  Very well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=232.6s)]
*  What's your take on him? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=235.6s)]
*  You said that because I said Tesla. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=236.8s)]
*  I did. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=238.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's the first thing that and that everyone's always [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=239.5s)]
*  like, oh, Elon's got these answers. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=241.9s)]
*  I think he's a great. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=243.4s)]
*  I think he's a great team player. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=244.6s)]
*  You know, like I said that about about Ray Kurzweil and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=246.8s)]
*  Utopia, you know, in Rome, they would bring all the most [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  brilliant people and have them sit down to the point where [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=257.7s)]
*  their seats had a toilet and I'm like people would not even [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  get up to use the bathroom and they would ideate about what [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=262.6s)]
*  society needed and they'd invent new things and he put it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=268.3s)]
*  all up on the wall and Donda before it was a school. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  Is a design firm and what I would do is pull together all [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=277.1s)]
*  my favorite thinkers and we'd invent. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=284.0s)]
*  That's why I was happy that you saw two of the inventions [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=286.5s)]
*  right there, you know, because now it's like if I had said [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=289.1s)]
*  that before you drank the coffee and some might joke and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=291.3s)]
*  say you're drinking the Kool-Aid, but before you drank [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=295.5s)]
*  the coffee and before you saw the 3D printed boot. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=297.8s)]
*  Zero Waste 3D printed boot. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=303.5s)]
*  If I said Nikolai Tesla, you'd probably you could have you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=306.29999999999995s)]
*  could have smugged that off. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  I you know. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  I think it's I think it's insane for an administration to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=316.5s)]
*  not use a talent like Elon Musk more. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=321.7s)]
*  Like if I was in a or once I am I will eventually be president [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  before you know in my lifetime. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=333.6s)]
*  But if I was in the in office right now, I would be meeting [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=337.2s)]
*  I recall an Elon every day. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=342.3s)]
*  I'd have him sleep in in the White House. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=344.4s)]
*  I say how do we use our platform? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=346.0s)]
*  As the most influential comp that's a 4D and slip the most [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=349.4s)]
*  influential country in the world. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=353.3s)]
*  To show the rest of the world how to live a simplified life, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=356.9s)]
*  but our country is under attack and media and industries [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=361.7s)]
*  outside of our country are doing anything to keep it as it [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  was and everyone's just afraid God is love and I understand [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=375.3s)]
*  I come off scary sometimes because I'm like I'm going to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=381.40000000000003s)]

*  to pull the guns out. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=391.3s)]
*  You have to pull the swords out. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  You have to have righteous indignation as a Christian for [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=393.5s)]
*  everyone that ever said I can't get mad because I'm a Christian [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=396.8s)]
*  as a Christian. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=400.20000000000005s)]

*  in the fashion industry. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=408.5s)]
*  The two most liberal businesses probably in the world as a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=409.70000000000005s)]
*  professing Christian with a pro-life badge on how does [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  that work? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=416.3s)]
*  I always think whenever I think whenever God allows a brilliant [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  idea to channel through me and allows me to somehow, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, take credit for it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=427.5s)]
*  I was snicker at the fact that with liberals their main, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=431.5s)]
*  you know, their main tool is, you know, that they use our [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  artists and influence influencers, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=446.1s)]
*  But then God has the number one artist and number one influencer [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=450.0s)]
*  as a conservative. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=456.0s)]
*  So I always chuckle at that every time I come up with some [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=457.3s)]
*  brilliant like could you imagine if you know, they could have [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=459.70000000000005s)]
*  just indoctrinated yay, you know, the world could have just [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loPhnAIAECM&t=462.8s)]
