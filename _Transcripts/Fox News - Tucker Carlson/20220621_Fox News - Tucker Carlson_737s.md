# Tucker Carlson: Stephen Colbert sounds like a Biden flack
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=0.0s)]
*  So last Thursday, last week on Thursday, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=3.12s)]
*  talk show host Stephen Colbert [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=5.32s)]
*  dispatched a group of seven of his employees [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  to Washington, D.C. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=8.76s)]
*  Their job, break into the U.S. Capitol complex [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=10.32s)]
*  and harass lawmakers inside. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  So the group dutifully arrived in the afternoon [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=15.76s)]
*  and were met almost immediately [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=17.68s)]
*  by uniform Capitol Hill police officers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=18.92s)]
*  who threw them out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  But apparently on orders from Colbert, they returned. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=23.12s)]
*  At about 4 p.m. on Thursday, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  the group reentered the building. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=27.44s)]
*  Accounts vary as to what exactly happened next, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=29.46s)]
*  but it seems clear that Colbert's employees [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=31.82s)]
*  were led inside by an ally within the building. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=33.74s)]
*  That would be a freshman member of Congress [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=37.1s)]
*  from Massachusetts called Jake Auchincloss. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=39.02s)]
*  Once on federal property, Colbert's employees [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  did what they came to do, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=43.84s)]
*  which was disrupt the business of Congress. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=44.74s)]
*  And apparently they were not subtle about doing it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=47.74s)]
*  They pounded on doors and yelled. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=49.46s)]
*  Whatever they did, it got people's attention. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  It takes an awful lot for a police force [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=54.46s)]
*  controlled by Nancy Pelosi to arrest a group [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=56.9s)]
*  of left-wing entertainment figures. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=59.62s)]
*  But that's exactly what happened next. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=61.6s)]
*  Capitol Hill police arrested seven Colbert employees [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=63.7s)]
*  and brought them to jail. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=66.26s)]
*  All seven of them were charged with unlawful entry. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=67.98s)]
*  Now that's the identical charge [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=70.98s)]
*  that hundreds of January 6th defendants [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=72.68s)]
*  have been prosecuted for. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=74.62s)]
*  But unlike January 6th defendants, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  Colbert's employees were not sent to the D.C. jail [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=78.3s)]
*  for a year and a half in solitary confinement. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=80.8s)]
*  No, they were released after only a night behind bars. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=82.62s)]
*  And then they fled back to New York. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=86.1s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=88.22s)]
*  What exactly is the difference in the crime? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=89.28s)]
*  As a legal question, we still don't know the answer. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=93.02s)]
*  For some reason, Capitol Hill police [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  have not released the surveillance tapes [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=96.46s)]
*  that would show exactly what Colbert's employees did [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=98.94s)]
*  that so triggered the police force controlled [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=102.06s)]
*  by Nancy Pelosi that they were arrested. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=104.22s)]
*  But whatever they did, otherwise sympathetic members [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=107.34s)]
*  of Congress are running away from it as quickly as they can. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=109.8s)]
*  We do not condone any inappropriate activity [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=113.02s)]
*  within the Capitol, Jake Auchincloss's office [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=115.8s)]
*  told us today. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=118.16s)]
*  It was a factual matter. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=119.52s)]
*  That is not true. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=121.08s)]
*  In fact, Jake Auchincloss has a recent history [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=122.6s)]
*  of condoning criminal behavior in the Capitol. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=125.36s)]
*  Just this March, surveillance cameras in the complex [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=128.8s)]
*  caught Jake Auchincloss's chief of staff, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=131.44s)]
*  that would be a former Adam Schiff staffer called Tim Heism, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=133.6s)]
*  vandalizing the front door of Congresswoman [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=137.46s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal office. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=139.72s)]
*  Heism did this not once, but several times. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=142.6s)]
*  Violently, like a man obsessed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=145.66s)]
*  Capitol police quickly filed an arrest warrant against him [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=148.14s)]
*  because Tim Heism clearly posed a threat [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=150.66s)]
*  to a member of Congress. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=152.98s)]
*  But Jake Auchincloss did not fire him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=155.18s)]
*  Instead, Jake Auchincloss defended Heism's vandalism [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  as noble and justified. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=160.1s)]
*  "'Our office is not going to apologize,' [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  read a long and self-righteous statement [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=164.26s)]
*  from Jake Auchincloss. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  In other words, we don't like Marjorie Taylor Greene's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=167.66s)]
*  politics, therefore we can do whatever we want to her. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=170.24s)]
*  And we will. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=173.18s)]
*  For the most part, the media ignored this story. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=175.12s)]
*  So Jake Auchincloss and Adam Schiff [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=177.1s)]
*  felt emboldened to go further. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=178.96s)]
*  They invited Colbert's employees to the Capitol [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=181.04s)]
*  to harass Marjorie Taylor Greene some more, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=183.26s)]
*  which is what they were trying to do [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=185.64s)]
*  when they were arrested by Capitol Hill police. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=187.12s)]
*  Now, whatever you think of her politics, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=190.28s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene is a sitting member of Congress. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=191.48s)]
*  Preventing her or any other member of Congress [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  from carrying out official duties as a public representative [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  is by definition an attack on democracy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  So how is what Stephen Colbert did different [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=203.66s)]
*  from what the protesters on January 6th [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=206.98s)]
*  have been convicted of doing? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=209.02s)]
*  That's a very good question. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=211.64s)]
*  And it's a question that Colbert himself [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=213.3s)]
*  spent the weekend thinking about. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=214.74s)]
*  His conclusion? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=216.34s)]
*  Well, unlike Trump voters, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=217.16s)]
*  Stephen Colbert is a very good person. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Therefore, any comparison to Trump voters [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=221.7s)]
*  is not simply ridiculous, it is a moral crime. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=223.62s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=226.82s)]
*  Now, it's predictable why these TV talkers [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=228.18s)]
*  are talking like this on the TV. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=230.48s)]
*  They want to talk about something other [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=232.72s)]
*  than the January 6th hearings [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  on the actual seditionist insurrection [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=235.88s)]
*  that led to the deaths of multiple people [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  and the injury of over 140 police officers. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=241.02s)]
*  But drawing any equivalence between rioters [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=244.32s)]
*  storming our Capitol to prevent the counting [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  of electoral ballots and a cigar-chomping toy dog [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  is a shameful and grotesque insult [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=252.32s)]
*  to the memory of everyone who died. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=255.12s)]
*  And it obscenely trivializes the service and the courage [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=257.24s)]
*  that the Capitol police showed on that terrible day. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=260.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it was a toy dog. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  It's shameful. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=267.6s)]
*  In other words, when you criticize me, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=268.70000000000005s)]
*  you're really criticizing the brave Capitol police officers [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=271.04s)]
*  who arrested the people who worked for me, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=274.0s)]
*  the ones who committed the crimes I asked them to commit. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=275.86s)]
*  And I, for one, will not stand for that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=277.92s)]
*  That's what he just said. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  Now, what you have there is not so much an explanation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=282.70000000000005s)]
*  In fact, it doesn't explain anything. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=284.88s)]
*  Instead, it's a master's class [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  on whiny, rich, liberal self-righteousness. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=288.38s)]
*  It's a distillation of a worldview [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=290.24s)]
*  that is so concise and so perfect, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=291.72s)]
*  it is certain to be studied by cultural historians [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=293.72s)]
*  of the future seeking to understand [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=295.68s)]
*  how our civilization collapsed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=296.92s)]
*  Not only am I not sorry, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=299.04s)]
*  you're the criminal for bringing it up. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  Stop hitting me, he screams as he punches you in the face. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  That is passive aggression taken to the level of art. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=306.76s)]
*  In any way, Colbert says, shut up. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=310.76s)]
*  I'm a comedian with a toy dog. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=313.2s)]
*  You can't criticize me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=315.68s)]
*  So the question really is, is Stephen Colbert a comedian? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=318.1s)]
*  Well, if you're one of the relatively few people [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=323.66s)]
*  still watching Stephen Colbert's show on CBS, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=325.38000000000005s)]
*  you'll have to admit it is hard to tell. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=327.5s)]
*  Most nights, Stephen Colbert sounds like [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=330.38000000000005s)]
*  the notably unfunny Kareem Jean-Pierre. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  He sounds like a Biden flack, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=335.22s)]
*  delivering whatever talking points [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  the White House tells him to repeat. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  And if you doubt that, here's what it looks like. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=340.66s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden did it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=343.9s)]
*  The biggest story continues to be the one [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  you were thinking about when you weren't sleeping last night. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  And it's the one happening all over America, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=360.97999999999996s)]
*  the protests in wake of the murder of George Floyd. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=363.06s)]
*  And please don't buy the false narrative [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=366.82s)]
*  that these are lawless mobs. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=368.78s)]
*  The vast majority of these protests have been peaceful. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=370.82s)]
*  There's a simple, if extremely difficult solution, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=374.17999999999995s)]
*  reduce the number of guns. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  We've done it before and it worked. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=379.97999999999996s)]
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a humanitarian crisis, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=382.41999999999996s)]
*  but also it is a triumph of humanity. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=384.9s)]
*  Take that, Putin. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=387.9s)]
*  Okay, so I might have the most privilege [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=390.34s)]
*  of any white person you've ever met. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=392.53999999999996s)]
*  How do I identify that in my own life? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=394.7s)]
*  Because if I have white privilege, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=396.85999999999996s)]
*  I want to be able to identify it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  Give me some hints as to my white privilege. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=399.9s)]
*  Get the Vax, peasants, surrender your guns, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=413.26s)]
*  support Ukraine, and remember, it's called Kiev now. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=415.82s)]
*  This isn't comedy, it's a very sad midlife crisis. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=420.82s)]
*  But more than that, it's information war [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  being waged against television viewers [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=425.34s)]
*  on behalf of the Democratic Party. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=427.42s)]
*  At least when the White House press secretary does it, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=430.26s)]
*  she admits what she's doing. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=431.86s)]
*  Colbert hides behind his former job as a comedian. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=433.42s)]
*  It was all a joke! [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=435.54s)]
*  When people, I don't like break into the Capitol, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=436.74s)]
*  it's insurrection. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  When we do it, it's sketch comedy, right? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=439.18s)]
*  It's getting harder to maintain that lie. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=442.86s)]
*  And here's how you know. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  Comedians have a sense of humor. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=445.98s)]
*  It is in fact a job requirement. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=448.26s)]
*  But Stephen Colbert does not. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=450.22s)]
*  Stephen Colbert has lost his sense of humor, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=451.94s)]
*  along with the critical distance and perspective [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=453.86s)]
*  that make humor possible. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=455.7s)]
*  At this point, he's just a partisan scold. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=457.65999999999997s)]
*  And you know that for certain, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  because even as he watched the QAnon shaman [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=461.78s)]
*  parade around the Capitol on January 6th, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=464.26s)]
*  Stephen Colbert did not laugh. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=466.65999999999997s)]
*  Now an actual comedian, whatever his politics, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=468.02s)]
*  would have found that spectacle hilarious, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=470.78s)]
*  because let's be honest, it was. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  Hey! [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=475.82s)]
*  Hey, man. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  Glad to see you guys. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=480.62s)]
*  You guys are patriots. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=481.7s)]
*  Look at this guy, he's got blood, God bless you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=482.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=486.18s)]
*  You're good, sir. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  Do you need medical attention? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=488.82s)]
*  I'm good, thank you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  You all right? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=490.5s)]
*  I got shot in the face. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=493.34s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=494.46s)]
*  I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=496.18s)]
*  Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=498.86s)]
*  We will. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=501.82s)]
*  I've been making sure there ain't disrespect in the place. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=502.65999999999997s)]
*  Okay, just wanna let you guys know, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=504.74s)]
*  this is like the sacredest place. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=505.9s)]
*  Hey! [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=508.7s)]
*  This is the guy in the bear skin and the horn hat. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=510.78s)]
*  That's not hilarious. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=514.94s)]
*  Yes, it is hilarious. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=516.0200000000001s)]
*  No, he's a seditious insurrectionist, said Colbert. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=518.1400000000001s)]
*  He needs to go to jail. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=521.6600000000001s)]
*  He's a terrorist. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=522.6600000000001s)]
*  And when he was sent to jail, Colbert applauded. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=523.5s)]
*  Now that's how Maoist cadres act. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=527.2600000000001s)]
*  That's not how comedians act. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=529.46s)]
*  So Stephen Colbert may be a late night host still, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=531.6600000000001s)]
*  for some reason, but he has zero sense of humor. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  He ought to step aside and let some young person [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=538.62s)]
*  who still gets the joke to have the job, but he won't. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=542.3s)]
*  He was Colbert on November 6th, 2020. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=545.9s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  And if you did not know that Joe Biden [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=549.58s)]
*  was getting close to 270, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=552.34s)]
*  Donald Trump just provided all the proof you will ever need. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  True story, I'm wearing black tonight [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=559.26s)]
*  because I was getting dressed this afternoon. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=561.26s)]
*  And I thought he might try some shenanigans [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=563.42s)]
*  and it might be fitting to tell jokes [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=565.86s)]
*  while wearing something somber [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=567.22s)]
*  if he goes down that dark path. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=568.86s)]
*  So we all knew he would do this. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=570.94s)]
*  What I didn't know is that it would hurt so much. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=587.3800000000001s)]
*  Those are real tears. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=592.6600000000001s)]
*  The only real thing about that show, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=593.5400000000001s)]
*  we're not trying to belabor the point, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=595.5400000000001s)]
*  but the guy's not a comedian. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=597.58s)]
*  You watch a comedian, you think, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=599.1s)]
*  I think that guy's hilarious. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=599.94s)]
*  I'd love to meet him. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=600.94s)]
*  Imagine eating a meal with Stephen Colbert. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=601.7800000000001s)]
*  Chances are you somehow offend him [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=604.7800000000001s)]
*  over the course of a typical dinner [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=606.3800000000001s)]
*  by saying something he finds offensive. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=607.74s)]
*  What are the chances of that? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=609.46s)]
*  100%. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=610.3000000000001s)]
*  Stephen Colbert is a Karen. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=612.1400000000001s)]
*  He's a brittle middle-aged woman [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=613.86s)]
*  who's always lecturing you about something. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=615.34s)]
*  In fact, he's Elizabeth Warren. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=616.86s)]
*  They even look alike. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=619.0200000000001s)]
*  Have you seen them in the same room recently? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=620.58s)]
*  No. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=622.4200000000001s)]
*  Sad, he was talented at one point. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=623.58s)]
*  So was Robert Schmeigel. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=625.1800000000001s)]
*  That's one of the Colbert employees [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=626.9000000000001s)]
*  who was also arrested last week. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=629.26s)]
*  Schmeigel's been doing his dog puppet routine for 30 years. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=630.86s)]
*  That's the one that Colbert is now hiding. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=634.22s)]
*  It was just a dog puppet. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=635.54s)]
*  The dog puppet was kind of funny [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=637.9s)]
*  during the Clinton administration. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=639.34s)]
*  It is pure hackery now. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=640.46s)]
*  Schmeigel keeps going because he's got a political message [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=643.5s)]
*  for him and a peach over the hill with my political message. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=645.62s)]
*  No one laughs at Robert Schmeigel anymore. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=649.06s)]

*  Be honest. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=661.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=662.5s)]
*  The guy at Pelosi's desk is hilarious [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=664.5400000000001s)]
*  compared to the guy with the talking dog. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=666.98s)]
*  And none of them is half as funny, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=669.38s)]
*  again, sorry it's true, as Donald Trump. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=671.22s)]

*  Fawning over the indigenous cuisine [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=690.74s)]
*  of the Latinx community. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=692.42s)]
*  Nobody likes that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=695.46s)]

*  has not a single Hispanic viewer. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=699.18s)]
*  His audience is entirely self-hating white liberals like him. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=701.58s)]
*  So nobody watches anymore. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=705.58s)]
*  And that's fine, that's CBS's problem. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=707.78s)]
*  But don't tell us you're a comedian [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  and therefore exempt from the normal rules of behavior [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe9uddh_G6A&t=712.82s)]
