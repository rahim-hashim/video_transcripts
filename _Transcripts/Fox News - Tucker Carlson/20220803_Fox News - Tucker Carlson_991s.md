# Tucker: This is totally pointless
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, the thing about the Chinese government is, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=2.16s)]
*  this is kind of weird, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=4.32s)]
*  the Chinese government almost never celebrates diversity. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=5.2s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=8.24s)]
*  American liberals, liberals throughout the West [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=9.6s)]
*  love China. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=11.4s)]
*  It's Justin Trudeau's model, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=12.9s)]
*  but China does not celebrate diversity. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=14.46s)]
*  In fact, and the American media never says this, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=17.2s)]
*  but it's absolutely true, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  China is a militarized ethnostate. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=20.52s)]
*  It's run along traditional fascist lines [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=22.96s)]
*  for the benefit of a specific ethnic group, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=24.96s)]
*  the Han Chinese. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=27.64s)]
*  That's not supposed to be allowed, but they're doing it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=29.64s)]
*  So to Chinese leaders, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=31.92s)]
*  the concept of diversity, equity, and inclusion, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=33.24s)]
*  those concepts make no sense at all. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  At best, they're bizarre. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=37.44s)]
*  It's one of those incomprehensible jokes [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=39.28s)]
*  that Western liberals tell. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=40.88s)]
*  The Chinese don't get it at all. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=42.0s)]
*  So when Nancy Pelosi took off for Taiwan today [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=44.18s)]
*  aboard a US military jet, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=46.92s)]
*  the Chinese government did not issue a statement [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  applauding her remarkable display of spunky girl power. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  No one in Beijing congratulated Nancy Pelosi [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=54.72s)]
*  for breaking glass ceilings [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=57.0s)]
*  as the very first speaker in history [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=58.28s)]
*  to identify as a woman. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=59.96s)]
*  No one in China even mentioned that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=61.84s)]
*  Instead, Chinese leaders treated Pelosi's arrival [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=64.2s)]
*  like an invasion. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=66.6s)]
*  Air raid sirens sounded in coastal towns in China [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  as her plane approached. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=70.92s)]
*  When she finally landed, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=72.12s)]
*  the Chinese military announced live fire exercises [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=73.04s)]
*  in the airspace around Taiwan for the next four days. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=76.2s)]
*  China's foreign ministry declared [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=79.32s)]
*  that Nancy Pelosi's mere presence, quote, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=80.72s)]
*  gravely undermines peace and stability [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=83.76s)]
*  across the Taiwan Strait, end quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  proving that in Asia, as at home, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=88.36s)]
*  things rarely improve when Nancy Pelosi shows up. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=91.72s)]
*  So the question really is, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  why did she go in the first place? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=96.04s)]
*  That's the real question. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  And the official line in Washington, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=99.48s)]
*  as always, is totally implausible, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  is that Pelosi's trip was designed to, quote, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  reaffirm Taiwan's status as a US ally. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=108.4s)]
*  Except the problem is Taiwan is not a US ally. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  In fact, Taiwan may be the only country in the world [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=112.4s)]
*  the Biden administration believes [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=115.04s)]
*  does not have the right of self-determination. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=116.4s)]
*  Quote, we do not support Taiwan's independence. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=118.92s)]
*  Wait a second, they're against democracy? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=122.84s)]
*  You thought they were for democracy, right? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=124.92s)]
*  They're always throwing democracy at you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  Turns out they don't mean it, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=128.4s)]
*  not that you ever thought they did. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=129.24s)]
*  So the one thing you can be certain of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=131.28s)]
*  is that Nancy Pelosi did not fly all the way to Taiwan [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=133.4s)]
*  to signal that the United States [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=136.44s)]
*  is going to defend that island from a Chinese invasion. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=137.6s)]
*  We're not gonna do that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=140.08s)]
*  We're not in a position to do that, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=141.24s)]
*  even if we wanted to do that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  We've already sent too many of our surface-to-air missiles, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=144.52s)]
*  for example, to Ukraine, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  where our oligarch friends are busy selling them [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  to various dark actors on the international arms market. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=150.28s)]
*  So if there's a major war in Asia anytime soon, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=153.68s)]
*  we will not be winning it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=156.24s)]
*  Every sober person knows that, sad but true. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=157.88s)]
*  So what's really going on here? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, on the internet, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=162.68s)]
*  you may have noticed quite a bit of speculation, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=163.52s)]
*  some of it generated by Chinese state media, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=164.88s)]
*  that Pelosi went to Taiwan to check on investments [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=167.08s)]
*  that her husband, Paul, made using insider information. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=170.04s)]
*  Now, he did make those investments, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=172.6s)]
*  and he has to use insider information. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  That's why he's such a fantastic stock picker [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=175.48s)]
*  worth more than $100 million. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=177.04s)]
*  In this case, Paul Pelosi bought semiconductor stock. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=178.92s)]
*  Taiwan makes semiconductors. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=181.72s)]
*  Rising tensions in the region [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  will create more demand for semiconductors. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=184.64s)]
*  That's the theory. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=186.76s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=188.48s)]
*  Well, Nancy Pelosi is from Baltimore, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  so we would not put anything past her, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=191.32s)]
*  but it doesn't quite satisfy as an explanation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  That is a long and highly public trip to take [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=196.76s)]
*  for a relatively small investment. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=199.24s)]
*  There's gotta be something else going on. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=200.84s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=202.68s)]
*  Well, it is entirely possible [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=204.24s)]
*  that the most obvious explanation for this debacle [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=205.56s)]
*  is the right one. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=208.0s)]
*  It's possible that the Biden administration [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=209.36s)]
*  are so completely incompetent. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  The people who run the White House [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=213.68s)]
*  are so utterly blinded by their own arrogance [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=214.88s)]
*  and their ineptitude, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=217.28s)]
*  that they just don't appreciate [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=218.72s)]
*  or even understand the implications of what they are doing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=220.4s)]
*  So Nancy Pelosi got bored of spending the summer in Napa, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  and she wanted to take a free trip to Asia [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  where she could pretend to be a statesman for a week. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=228.16s)]
*  Girl power, let her go. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=229.96s)]
*  It's possible that's all the thinking they did [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=233.16s)]
*  before signing off on Pelosi's trip. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=236.64s)]
*  Here, for example, in John Kirby here, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=239.76s)]
*  you're supposed to take seriously [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=241.32s)]
*  proving the point effectively this morning on Fox. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=242.88s)]
*  The aggressiveness, the coercion, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=246.72s)]
*  the increase in tensions in the last weeks and months [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=249.0s)]
*  have all come from the Chinese side. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=251.76s)]
*  What we have said is that there's no reason [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=253.28s)]
*  that this visit should escalate tensions [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=256.0s)]
*  in any way whatsoever. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=258.4s)]
*  Oh, so there's no reason that this visit [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=261.24s)]
*  should escalate tensions in any way whatsoever. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=263.88s)]
*  Thanks, John Kirby, for describing the world [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=266.8s)]
*  as you fervently wish it was. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=269.08s)]
*  We'd love to know your views on perpetual motion machines. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=270.44s)]
*  Now back to reality as we actually find it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=273.96s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan has, in fact, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=278.16s)]
*  dramatically escalated tensions [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=280.64s)]
*  in the region throughout Asia. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=282.72s)]
*  In fact, escalated them more than any single act [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=284.08s)]
*  in recent memory. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=286.68s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself for what? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  How exactly is the United States, which she serves, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=291.28s)]
*  benefiting from what she's doing? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  Is there an upside here for us? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=297.44s)]
*  That's one question that people like John Kirby [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=299.96s)]
*  never think to ask. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  They just assume that China must be bluffing, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=303.76s)]
*  just another backward third world government [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  making huffy noises. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=307.4s)]
*  Don't have to take them seriously, just like Russia. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=308.88s)]
*  Well, they say they're gonna invade Ukraine. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=311.52s)]
*  If we push Ukraine to join NATO, who cares what they think? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=313.12s)]
*  They're a gas station with a government. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=316.8s)]
*  They're bluffing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=319.6s)]
*  That's what arrogance does to you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=321.92s)]
*  It blinds you to reality. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  So the question is, is China bluffing? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=325.24s)]
*  What if they're not? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=327.96s)]
*  What if in response to Pelosi's totally pointless trip [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=329.32s)]
*  to Taiwan, the Chinese decide to seize the Kinmen Islands, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=332.08s)]
*  which are now governed by Taiwan, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=335.48s)]
*  in whose defense we've implicitly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=337.16s)]
*  and effectively guaranteed for 75 years? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=338.92s)]
*  Well, that could actually happen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=341.76s)]
*  The Chinese government is already making the kind of noises [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  you would expect it to make before doing something like that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=346.2s)]
*  Here's a selection. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=349.2s)]
*  Ahead of the stop, the Chinese government [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=351.08s)]
*  continued to ramp up their warnings, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=353.0s)]
*  saying it undermines China's sovereignty and security. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=354.92s)]
*  We hope US officials will clearly understand [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=359.84s)]
*  the importance and sensitivity of the issue [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=362.36s)]
*  and how dangerous it would be if the visit actually happens. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=364.48s)]
*  The Chinese claim Taiwan as their own, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=367.76s)]
*  and there are concerns Beijing could use the visit [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=370.04s)]
*  as a pretext to ramp up military action in the area. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  Huh, maybe that's bluffing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=377.48s)]
*  Maybe it's not. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=380.16s)]
*  But the deeper question is, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=381.76000000000005s)]
*  when's the last time American liberals built something? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  When is the last time Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  or any of these people, Susan Rice, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  created something worth having? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=394.44s)]
*  Hmm, we'll give you a few minutes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=396.48s)]
*  Never. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=400.04s)]
*  They break things. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=400.92s)]
*  They show up, they make things worse, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=402.24s)]
*  they move on to the next thing, they never apologize. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  They did it in Afghanistan, they did it in Iraq, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=406.56s)]
*  they did it in Ukraine, they did it in Syria, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=408.76000000000005s)]
*  they did it in Libya. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  Are they gonna do it now with China? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=412.0s)]
*  Breaking things. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=414.48s)]
*  In fact, if you were trying to give Beijing a pretext [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  to seize Taiwan, this is exactly the kind of trip [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=419.04s)]
*  you would take. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  And what would happen if Beijing seized Taiwan? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=423.12s)]
*  Well, it'd be a humanitarian disaster for the Taiwanese. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  They would lose any semblance of self-determination. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=428.8s)]
*  Democracy would die. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=431.0s)]
*  So that's bad. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  But more to the point, it would be a disaster for us. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=434.52s)]
*  For us, because it would make, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=436.96s)]
*  and this has been the effect of virtually every policy [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=439.48s)]
*  to come out of the Biden administration, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=441.44s)]
*  it would make China more powerful. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=442.88s)]
*  How powerful is China? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=444.8s)]
*  We understate their power, actually. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=445.84s)]
*  China already makes 90% of the world's antibiotics. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  It makes 80% of the world's lithium batteries. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=450.4s)]
*  96% of the shipping containers used to transport goods [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=452.8s)]
*  across the world, mostly from China, are made in China. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=455.76s)]
*  But one thing China does not yet control [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  is the semiconductor industry. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=460.56s)]
*  At the end of 2021, China held just 4% [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=463.16s)]
*  of the global semiconductor market. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  North America and the Asia-Pacific region [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=468.6s)]
*  are the dominant players. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, semiconductors are not a small thing. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  In fact, they're essential to modern life. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=473.08000000000004s)]
*  They're in everything. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  From brake sensors in your car, to your phone, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  to your computer, they're in everything. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  And as it happens, virtually all advanced semiconductors [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=480.88s)]
*  are made, where are they made? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=484.04s)]
*  Oh, they're made in Taiwan. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=485.0s)]
*  The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=486.84s)]
*  makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  It is by far the world's largest semiconductor foundry. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=491.88s)]
*  Without the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=494.84s)]
*  that would mean companies like Apple, Qualcomm, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=498.32s)]
*  and many others could not function. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=501.12s)]
*  That's a lot of the American economy. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=504.23999999999995s)]
*  Last year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=506.28s)]
*  accounted for more than half of the total [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=508.64s)]
*  foundry revenue in the world. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=510.28s)]
*  So maybe showing up in Taiwan would give Beijing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=513.24s)]
*  a pretext to invade Taiwan and take over [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=517.64s)]
*  the world's largest semiconductor foundry. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=520.04s)]
*  And that puts us in the beta position [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=523.28s)]
*  to an even greater extent, to put it mildly. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=525.96s)]
*  Is that the goal of this trip? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=529.16s)]
*  Could it be that Tony Blinken and Barack Obama [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=531.04s)]
*  and the rest of the people who are actually [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  running the Biden administration, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=534.84s)]
*  without the knowledge of Joe Biden, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=536.16s)]
*  who can't remember anything at this point, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  could it be that all these people know perfectly well [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=539.72s)]
*  how reckless this is, know perfectly well [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=541.36s)]
*  what the effects could be, and they're doing it [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=543.0s)]
*  not just in spite of those effects, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=545.08s)]
*  but because of those effects, because actually, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=546.64s)]
*  at least on some gut level, they want to hasten [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=549.0s)]
*  the end of American hegemony, which is to say, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=551.08s)]
*  the end of the US as we know it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=553.92s)]
*  That would explain why they sent Kamala Harris, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=556.56s)]
*  of all people, to avert a war in Ukraine, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=558.84s)]
*  knowing full well that Kamala Harris [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=561.72s)]
*  would read the notes they wrote for her [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=563.56s)]
*  and insist that Ukraine join NATO [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=565.28s)]
*  and then guarantee that Russia invades Ukraine, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=567.92s)]
*  constricts the world's energy and food markets [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=571.0s)]
*  and makes us weaker. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=573.56s)]
*  Huh, maybe they knew that would happen. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=575.52s)]
*  Maybe they're not that stupid. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=577.48s)]
*  Maybe that would also explain why they sent Nancy Pelosi [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=579.16s)]
*  over to Taiwan, effectively, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=581.64s)]
*  as the administration's representative, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=583.04s)]
*  even though Nancy Pelosi rivals Kamala Harris [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=585.56s)]
*  in her inability to form a coherent thought. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=588.4s)]
*  Now again, we alluded to this last night, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=592.36s)]
*  but it's just true, because we watch this stuff. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=593.48s)]
*  We hope you don't, we hope you have a real life. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=595.16s)]
*  But if you've seen Nancy Pelosi recently, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=597.28s)]
*  since she turned 80, for example, two years ago, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=599.88s)]
*  you know this is someone [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=602.48s)]
*  who was having a lot of trouble speaking. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=603.88s)]
*  Here was Pelosi at a briefing back in November, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=605.44s)]
*  for example. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=607.1600000000001s)]
*  The other thing that we're getting are, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=609.2800000000001s)]
*  we're sending stuff over to the Senate. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, most of the product that we've done is, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=614.44s)]
*  except now we may have added in the last day or so, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=618.96s)]
*  and some of what we added is Senate to the bill, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=622.32s)]
*  like a hearing. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=625.24s)]
*  Bernie doesn't like hearing. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=627.2800000000001s)]
*  Bernie loves hearing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=629.92s)]
*  Manchin doesn't want hearing in the bill, or that stuff. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  So some of the Senate oriented, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=635.6s)]
*  and then we had the family medical need. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=637.04s)]
*  We figured if they're putting things in, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=639.16s)]
*  then we can put something in, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=640.8s)]
*  even if Manchin doesn't like it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  So we are getting some [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=644.48s)]
*  bird and privilege. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=652.52s)]
*  I think most of it, we're getting privilege scrub, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=655.0s)]
*  because privilege struggles deadly to a bill. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=657.92s)]
*  Vertible is important, you have to take it out, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=660.4s)]
*  but privilege violation can take you out. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=664.52s)]
*  So at this point, August of 2022, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  Taiwan is the world's great flesh point. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=671.76s)]
*  It's the largest power with an aim. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=673.8s)]
*  It has articulated repeatedly over almost 80 years [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=677.04s)]
*  to invade a neighboring country, Taiwan. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=680.0s)]
*  So there's no more delicate place [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=683.52s)]
*  diplomatically on the globe. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  So if you're sending that person to calm tensions [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=687.24s)]
*  or reassure our allies, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=690.16s)]
*  you're probably not doing what you say you're doing. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=691.36s)]
*  You may be doing the opposite. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=692.96s)]
*  If you're trying to provoke your enemies [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=694.76s)]
*  and terrify your so-called allies, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=696.64s)]
*  you'd probably pick Nancy Pelosi [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=698.4s)]
*  as your representative in Taiwan. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=703.32s)]
*  Well, if you're wanting to understand the motive [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=704.96s)]
*  of the people in charge, consider this. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=707.32s)]
*  At the same moment that we are clearly goading [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=708.72s)]
*  other countries into conflict with each other and with us, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=710.8s)]
*  we are, meaning the Biden administration is, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=714.36s)]
*  degrading our ability to participate [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=716.2s)]
*  or prevail in those wars. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=719.12s)]
*  Our defensive capabilities have never been weaker, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=720.72s)]
*  and that's not an accident, they did it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=722.88s)]
*  For example, the Central Intelligence Agency, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  whatever you think of it, we don't think much, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=728.96s)]
*  kind of important to our country, certainly well-funded. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=730.72s)]
*  Here's a recent recruiting ad from the CIA. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=735.44s)]
*  I'm a woman of color. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=740.24s)]
*  I am a mom. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=741.72s)]
*  I am a cisgender millennial [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=743.0400000000001s)]
*  who's been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=744.68s)]
*  I am intersectional, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=748.2399999999999s)]
*  but my existence is not a box-checking exercise. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=749.7199999999999s)]
*  I am a walking declaration, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=753.28s)]
*  a woman whose inflection does not rise [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=755.28s)]
*  at the end of her sentences, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=757.64s)]
*  suggesting that a question has been asked. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  I used to struggle with imposter syndrome, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=761.3599999999999s)]
*  but at 36, I refuse to internalize [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=763.64s)]
*  misguided patriarchal ideas [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=766.5999999999999s)]
*  of what a woman can or should be. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=768.5999999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're intersectional with a generalized anxiety disorder? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=772.04s)]
*  Come work in a critical federal agency. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=775.0799999999999s)]
*  So if you're running an ad like that, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=778.16s)]
*  not only are you not serious, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=779.68s)]
*  you are trying to degrade and hurt [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=781.04s)]
*  the ability of the United States to defend itself, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=784.16s)]
*  to perpetuate itself, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=787.16s)]
*  to remain the United States for our grandchildren. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=790.4399999999999s)]
*  That's exactly what, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  let's stop lying about it, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=793.56s)]
*  that's exactly what you're doing. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=794.4s)]
*  And it's not just happening at CIA. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=795.7199999999999s)]
*  Nothing Joe Biden has done in the last year and a half [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=798.52s)]
*  has made our armed forces better prepared to fight wars. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=801.1999999999999s)]
*  Instead, it has been one calculated humiliation [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=804.92s)]
*  after another for the US armed forces, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=807.88s)]
*  VAX mandates, anti-white ideology, sex changes, drag shows. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=810.0s)]
*  Whatever is necessary to telegraph [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=815.56s)]
*  to the United States military, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=818.6s)]
*  you are worthless, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=819.76s)]
*  you are defending a country [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=820.88s)]
*  that does not deserve to be defended, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=822.16s)]
*  your traditions are disgusting, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=824.16s)]
*  you're terrible. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=827.12s)]
*  That's the message. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=828.4s)]
*  Here's the latest. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=829.24s)]
*  The VA has decided to desecrate military cemeteries [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=830.06s)]
*  that'd be America's last remaining national shrine [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=833.8s)]
*  or military cemeteries [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=836.4399999999999s)]
*  desecrated with industrial wind turbines. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=837.76s)]
*  One just went up in a Massachusetts national cemetery. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=840.24s)]
*  So take three steps back. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=843.9599999999999s)]
*  They are starting more wars [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=845.7199999999999s)]
*  while simultaneously making it harder [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=847.36s)]
*  for the United States to fight and prevail in those wars. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=849.16s)]
*  A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=852.8399999999999s)]
*  said this morning that their army will quote, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=855.0799999999999s)]
*  never sit by idly. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=858.28s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=860.36s)]
*  We have an army too. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=861.1999999999999s)]
*  And would take strong measures. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=862.4s)]
*  It won't sit by idly either. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=864.24s)]
*  Don't tell our leaders where they can go [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=865.8399999999999s)]
*  and where they can't go. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=868.5s)]
*  I salute Nancy Pelosi for going there, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=870.24s)]
*  for sending a message that Taiwan is an ally. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  And just as we won't support Taiwan's independence [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=876.04s)]
*  and breaking away from this one China policy, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  we will not stand idly by [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=885.3199999999999s)]
*  if the mainland China decides to invade Taiwan. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=888.76s)]
*  More childish posturing from people who have no idea [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=893.56s)]
*  what they're talking about [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=895.72s)]
*  and no skin in the game whatsoever. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=896.56s)]
*  The truth is we're not in a position [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=899.12s)]
*  to prosecute a successful war against China. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=900.62s)]
*  We should be. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  We should have been making defensive strategic moves [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=905.24s)]
*  for the past 20 years. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=908.24s)]
*  We should have been onshore and critical manufacturing, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=910.54s)]
*  building up a strong military and yes, a strong CIA, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=912.5799999999999s)]
*  not degrading them with identity politics [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=915.3s)]
*  and other pointless lunacy that detracts from the mission, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=918.74s)]
*  which is to protect the United States. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=920.9s)]
*  But that's exactly what we've done. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=922.68s)]
*  Republicans of Congress have allowed it to happen. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=924.14s)]
*  Oh, more funding for you. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=926.02s)]
*  So whatever the motive here is, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=928.42s)]
*  the effect is absolutely predictable. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=930.98s)]
*  As with Afghanistan and Ukraine and COVID [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=932.92s)]
*  and pick nine other disasters [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=936.34s)]
*  when what we're watching right now finally ends, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=937.9s)]
*  the US is likely to be weaker [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=940.06s)]
*  and China is likely to be stronger. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=941.54s)]
*  So what does this mean? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=944.18s)]
*  It means the beginning of the end [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=945.02s)]
*  of American influence in Asia, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=945.86s)]
*  influence that we paid for with blood. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=947.4599999999999s)]
*  And that's not an overstatement. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=949.62s)]
*  More than half a million American servicemen [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=951.06s)]
*  were killed or wounded in the Pacific theater [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=952.86s)]
*  in the Second World War and in Korea a few years after that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Bh9-ywUfo&t=954.26s)]
