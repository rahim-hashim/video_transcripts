# Tara Reade shares vulnerable moment: Joe Biden 'took my future'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70)
*  So you may have read in the news that Joe Biden just made America a little better by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=0.0s)]
*  signing the Speak Out Act into law. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=5.64s)]
*  It's supposed to combat sexual harassment. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=8.0s)]
*  What you probably didn't read is that Joe Biden himself has been credibly accused of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  sexual misconduct and not just by his own daughter, whom he showered with. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=14.76s)]
*  In the presidential election in 2020, Tara Reid, a woman called Tara Reid, emerged to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=19.8s)]
*  say that while working for Joe Biden in the U.S. Senate, he sexually assaulted her in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=23.26s)]
*  a violent way. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=28.96s)]
*  Most of the media buried the story. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=29.96s)]
*  And we'll be honest and admit that we didn't know what to think of it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  But we finally sat down and talked at great length with Tara Reid to hear what happened. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=36.64s)]
*  And we were completely convinced that this is real and that she was able to prove it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=42.32s)]
*  The whole story is part of a brand new episode of Tucker Carlson Today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=46.96s)]
*  But here's part of it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  When Biden started acting weird towards me, he would like put his hands on my shoulder [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=53.76s)]
*  and put his fingers underneath my hair and do weird things like that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  And then there was a scene where... [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=64.08s)]
*  What did you think of that? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=65.56s)]
*  I mean, did... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=66.56s)]
*  Well, you know, bear in mind, and you were around in a professional in the 90s. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=67.56s)]
*  It was a different... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=71.56s)]
*  I don't know if you were in D.C., but it was a different vibe. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=72.56s)]
*  I was in D.C., yeah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=74.56s)]
*  OK, it was a different vibe. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=75.56s)]
*  But it still was weird. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  I'd never had an employer do that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  And Panetta certainly didn't act like that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=79.44s)]
*  No, he's not like that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=81.12s)]
*  He's not at all. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=82.48s)]
*  And he's just all business. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=83.48s)]
*  And, you know, Joe Biden was always... [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=84.48s)]
*  He didn't seem like an intellectual giant, let's put it that way. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=88.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=91.48s)]
*  No, he was famously not. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=92.48s)]
*  But a charismatic and warm guy, that was the conventional view. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=93.48s)]
*  You know, and that's the thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=98.48s)]
*  Behind closed doors, he was very... [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=99.48s)]
*  He was very temperamental. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=100.48s)]
*  And he would do this thing where he smiles when he's angry. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=103.48s)]
*  It's very disconcerting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=106.48s)]
*  Very disconcerting. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=108.48s)]
*  And he'd have that big smile and he'd be angry. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=109.84s)]
*  And he was very temperamental. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=111.84s)]
*  He had me up against a wall and he penetrated me with his fingers against my will. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=113.34s)]
*  And I... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=119.92s)]
*  You know, it was... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=120.92s)]
*  It wasn't just the assault, though. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=123.04s)]
*  It was everything to do with, here I am, this young staffer, and he did this, and then I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=125.84s)]
*  made him angry. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=134.2s)]
*  And that's like someone you don't want to make angry. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=135.8s)]
*  I just think it's... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=139.4s)]
*  I've got to be honest. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=140.4s)]
*  One of the reasons I didn't know what to make of your story was it's so... [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=141.4s)]
*  I've been a man for, you know, 53 years. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=145.96s)]
*  I've never heard of anything like that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=149.0s)]
*  That's... [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=150.8s)]
*  You know, men are kind of pigish, as we know, and they do pigish things. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=151.8s)]
*  But that's like... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=155.7s)]
*  That's like kind of like rape. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=157.36s)]
*  I mean, that's so out of bounds that it's weird to think someone would do something [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=158.36s)]
*  like that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=163.72s)]
*  It was just... [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  It happened all at once. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=166.52s)]
*  It happened really quickly. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  There was no like flirtation with him or anything like that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  It was very, you know... [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=170.96s)]
*  He was usually with people, and he wasn't. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  I was like at the wrong place at the wrong time, so to speak. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=176.88s)]
*  And when it happened, he at first was like, come on, man, I heard you liked me. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=180.12s)]
*  And I, you know, I froze. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  And then he said he got angry, and that's when he smiled, you know, that smile. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's what was really jarring. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=195.84s)]
*  And then he said... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=199.6s)]
*  He pointed his finger in my face, and he said, you're nothing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=201.8s)]
*  You're nothing to me. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=205.56s)]
*  And then I must have had a certain look on my face, and he just took my shoulders and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=207.72s)]
*  shook them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=211.6s)]
*  He said, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  And then he turned around and he walked away. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  And I remember it was just such a jarring, shocking incident. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=216.88s)]
*  Probably was all of less than five minutes, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=220.32s)]
*  But my vivid memory is sitting on these marble stairs, and my legs were shaking so badly, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=224.32s)]
*  because it wasn't just what he did. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=230.0s)]
*  It's that I knew my career was over. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=231.56s)]
*  That was it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=235.16s)]
*  Like, I had said no, it was an awful thing, and this was the end. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=236.16s)]
*  He used his power and resources to silence me. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=240.8s)]
*  And I'm going to share something with your audience. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=246.28s)]
*  They took a cannonball to my life. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=250.6s)]
*  They went after my family. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=253.48s)]
*  So that day, when he did that assault, he took my future. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=256.24s)]
*  I didn't want to sleep with some senator. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=262.2s)]
*  I wanted to be one. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=264.64s)]
*  And that day, it ended. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=267.56s)]
*  The cruelty she describes, not just an unwanted advance, not just the sexual violence, but [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=274.52s)]
*  the meanness to her from Joe Biden and from his staff and from people throughout the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=279.96s)]
*  Democratic Party will just absolutely blow your mind. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=286.4s)]
*  It's really offensive to anybody, not on partisan grounds. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=288.84s)]
*  But just as a human being, you can't believe people would act that way, but they did. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=292.12s)]
*  So we called the White House and we asked them for comment on what Tara Reid told us. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  Of course, they didn't respond. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=299.2s)]
*  You can watch the whole interview tomorrow morning on Fox Nation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=300.2s)]
*  Stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=309.96s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFM04SVY70&t=312.96s)]
