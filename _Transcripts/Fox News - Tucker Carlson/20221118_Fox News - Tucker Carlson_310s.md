# Adam Carolla: This is an excuse to cancel comedians
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk)
*  Adam Kroll who lives by that rule still, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=0.0s)]
*  he joins us tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=1.62s)]
*  Adam, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  How do you do comedy in a moment like this? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=4.5s)]
*  You still do stand up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=9.94s)]
*  Yes, I was on a stage at the improv in Hollywood last night [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=13.22s)]
*  and I was on a stage with another comedian [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=17.64s)]
*  and I started getting into some subject matter [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=21.16s)]
*  and I could see in his eyes, like, don't go there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=24.22s)]
*  We don't wanna get into trouble. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=27.2s)]
*  And that's a very troubling notion. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Comedians second guessing themselves, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=33.6s)]
*  worried about getting into trouble [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=36.92s)]
*  and also this notion of these idiots saying [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=38.96s)]
*  because a comedian says something, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=41.32s)]
*  people are gonna go do it as if you did [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  whatever George Carlin was talking about in the 70s [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=46.099999999999994s)]
*  or Mortsal or Richard Pryor. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=50.12s)]
*  You know, it's even like when they were accusing Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=52.68s)]
*  of telling people to inject bleach. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=55.08s)]
*  Okay, he's dangerous because he told people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=57.24s)]
*  to inject bleach. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=59.56s)]
*  How many Americans injected bleach? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=60.64s)]
*  This is the President of the United States [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=62.96s)]
*  and this is their excuse for canceling everyone [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=65.76s)]
*  because they know people don't listen to Dave Chappelle [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=68.56s)]
*  or Trump saying to inject bleach. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=71.68s)]
*  It's just an excuse for them to have dominion over you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=74.0s)]
*  It may be, however, that they're on to at least one point. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=79.44s)]
*  The one thing that average people might copy [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=82.72s)]
*  from a comedian is the willingness [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=85.24s)]
*  to mock the people in charge. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=87.36s)]
*  Maybe that's what they fear. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=89.38s)]
*  They don't wanna be mocked. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a definite truth in comedy [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=94.08s)]
*  that cuts right to the core. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  And they know if they lose and can't silence that community, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=101.0s)]
*  there's gonna be issues. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=106.44s)]
*  Remember when John Stewart was on Stephen Colbert's show [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=107.56s)]
*  several months ago and he was like, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  hello, Wuhan lab leak. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=113.32s)]
*  There's a virology lab up the street. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=116.44s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=118.8s)]
*  Watch Colbert's reaction to that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  He was like, oh my God, one of our own has crossed the line. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=122.66s)]
*  But it's not crossing the line. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=126.36s)]
*  It's a comedian being funny and making observations [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  that are patently true. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=132.18s)]
*  So how have you, I've always wondered, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=136.32s)]
*  I don't know if I've ever asked you, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=138.6s)]
*  how have you continued to act like it's 1986 when it's not? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=139.7s)]
*  Why doesn't it affect you? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=144.5s)]
*  Well, this is gonna sound self-serving, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  but you'll see it almost everywhere. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  You have to be good. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=152.98s)]
*  If you're good, you say what you want. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=154.38s)]
*  Dave Chappelle is good. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=156.62s)]
*  John Stewart is good. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=158.22s)]
*  They say what they want. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Most people live in the middle. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=161.66s)]
*  If you're a journalist and you have any kind of integrity, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=163.62s)]
*  you quit your job at the New York Times [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=167.58s)]
*  and you go to Substack. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=169.78s)]
*  Those are the good ones. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  But most people aren't good. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=172.9s)]
*  Most people are in the middle. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  And when you're in the middle, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=175.82000000000002s)]
*  whether you work for a big corporation [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=177.06s)]
*  or the New York Times or Netflix, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=179.38000000000002s)]
*  you need to keep your job. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=182.02s)]
*  Most Americans wanna keep their job over about anything else. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=183.66000000000003s)]
*  They're not good enough and they don't feel they're good enough [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  to say whatever they want and do whatever they want. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=190.9s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=193.9s)]
*  I wonder, though, when all of this ends, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  won't a lot of comedians be ashamed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  that they went along with speech codes, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=202.46s)]
*  which are antithetical to comedy and free thinking? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=205.3s)]
*  Comedians eat Count Chocula at four in the morning [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=210.22s)]
*  in a bathrobe in their living room every night. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=213.94s)]
*  They do not feel shame. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  They don't have the ability to do anything. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=219.18s)]
*  They don't have the shame gears [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=222.78s)]
*  that the rest of America is constrained by. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=224.78s)]
*  So, no, they don't normally feel shame. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=229.78s)]
*  They eat edibles, stay up all night and make fart jokes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=232.34s)]
*  So, they're a hard demographic to shame. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=236.02s)]
*  But my feeling is, is if you're a comedian, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=238.86s)]
*  you got in it to say what you wanted to say. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  And if you're curtailing that in any way, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=245.06s)]
*  especially because some woke a-holes are going after you, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=247.38s)]
*  then you're a coward and you've given in to the mob [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=251.18s)]
*  and you become a comedian to push back against the man. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  And the man is not Ron DeSantis. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=258.62s)]
*  The man is the woke mob if you're a comedian. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=261.7s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  Do you worry that venues where you're performing [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=268.66s)]
*  could be shut down? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=270.94s)]
*  No, but it doesn't mean it can't happen. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't have a choice. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=278.82s)]
*  I'm a comedian. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=280.5s)]
*  I have to say what I'm thinking. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=281.9s)]
*  Some people like it, some people won't like it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=283.78s)]
*  But the second that process ends, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=286.7s)]
*  I gotta go back to carpentry. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=289.14s)]
*  Still living like it's a free country. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=293.46s)]
*  Adam Carolla joins us tonight. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=295.38s)]
*  Adam, thank you so much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCBqj3XuWk&t=299.38s)]
