# Chicago Democrat rips Lori Lightfoot for city's rise in crime
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM)
*  Lori Lightfoot isn't doing anything to stop the madness. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=0.0s)]
*  She's too busy telling us if we can take a bite out of our muffins without spreading COVID. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=2.64s)]
*  Raymond Lopez is a Chicago city alderman and he joins me now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=8.08s)]
*  So Raymond, she's basically willing to sacrifice the lives of her own constituents last year, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=12.24s)]
*  just so she can look tough against that mean, mean man Donald Trump. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=19.2s)]
*  What a scoundrel. Is she seen as a scoundrel in Chicago by most people? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=24.16s)]
*  Well, Jesse, first off, Merry Christmas. And yes, most Chicagoans do not find it, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=30.64s)]
*  the least bit hip, find it very much hypocritical that the mayor 15 months ago told Donald Trump [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=35.28s)]
*  to get the hell out of Chicago with his assistance and basically pay politics with people's lives. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=41.92s)]
*  And here we are in 2021, over 812 people murdered by gun violence in the city of Chicago. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=48.16s)]
*  That number continues to rise. We've seen more children impacted by gun violence than by COVID. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=55.04s)]
*  And now she's doing the great pivot, the great about face and saying now that President Joe [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  Biden is here, she'll take the help. What about all those thousands of people whose lives have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=66.4s)]
*  been impacted by gun violence or the lives that were lost last year when she could have had help [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=71.36s)]
*  from the federal government, won't talk about it, won't apologize for it and just wishes to sweep [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=76.0s)]
*  it under the rug as though it never happened. Are you saying more children in Chicago have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=81.12s)]
*  died from bullets than have died from COVID-19? More children have been victimized by gun violence [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=86.16s)]
*  in the city of Chicago than have been killed by COVID in the entire state of Illinois in the last [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  year. The entire state of Illinois. It's astounding. And yet we still talk more about COVID than we do [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=99.12s)]
*  gun violence. Absolutely. Why not? It distracts from all the bloodshed. Have you heard anything [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=104.8s)]
*  from Barack Obama? Does he ever talk about the surge in homicides? I mean, this guy's hometown. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=110.0s)]
*  I mean, I know he lives in the vineyard and in Hawaii now, but do you ever hear him implore the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=116.08s)]
*  leaders of his hometown to do something about the violence? You know, even as President Obama [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=121.52s)]
*  works on building his Obama Center in Woodlawn and as many of our city officials are joining the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=130.08s)]
*  Biden administration, the fact that we have one of the most perceived violent cities in America [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=137.2s)]
*  seems to be lost on all of them. And everyday residents throughout the city of Chicago are [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  struggling. They feel that they are quite literally under the gun every time they step out of their [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  homes, whether it's to take their kids to school, whether it's to go to work, or whether it's just [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  to take a walk around the block. Children, working parents, and even our seniors are all at threat of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=158.72s)]
*  being victimized every day in this city with no one wanting to take responsibility for it or to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=165.6s)]
*  propose real solutions other than blaming someone else, as we heard from Lori Lightfoot this week. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=172.0s)]
*  And what we're seeing right now is that the pendulum that many Democratic politicians, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=177.28s)]
*  and I will say as a Democrat, I find it disgusting that we're at this point, but they've pushed the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=182.88s)]
*  pendulum so far to the left when it comes to criminal justice reform that we now favor criminals [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=188.16s)]
*  over victims, and that even as the politicians are becoming victims themselves, I'm more than [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=193.52s)]
*  certain they will never accept responsibility for the seeds that they've sown to bring us to this point. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  Even after getting carjacked at gunpoint, they're still not going to change their position. It's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  unbelievable, but at this point it's not surprising. Thank you so much Alderman Raymond Lopez. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fGODu_hmzM&t=210.64000000000001s)]
