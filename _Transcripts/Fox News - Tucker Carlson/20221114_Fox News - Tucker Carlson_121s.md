# How Rush Limbaugh foresaw cancel culture and 'wokeness' in 1993
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY)
*  Thirty years ago Rush Limbaugh made an insightful prediction about where our society would end up here it is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=0.0s)]
*  Because I'm wearing these ribbons. I care more than any of you about anything [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=7.72s)]
*  And these ribbons say so I want you people sitting at home and you people in the audience look down at your lapel right now [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=13.44s)]
*  I want you to do this put the camera back on me do this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=19.92s)]
*  When you look down, what do you see you don't see anything because you're not wearing any ribbons [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=23.76s)]
*  It means you're a bigot it means you're a racist. It means you're a sexist [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  It means you're a homophobe it probably means you're a white guy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  It probably means you're a European and you and you alone are responsible for all the ills of America [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=39.96s)]
*  But I'm not because I'm wearing these ribbons [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  I care more than you [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=47.0s)]
*  One of the reasons why I left the Democratic Party is because as you can see I wasn't wearing all the ribbons [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=53.48s)]
*  I was contempt condemned for not wearing all the ribbons [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=60.28s)]
*  The reality is that even if you have 19 of the 20 ribbons if you don't have that last one [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=64.96s)]
*  Then you're a cast out. You're not welcome. You're canceled. You're done [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=71.12s)]
*  There is no end to this insanity you continually have to prove yourself. It's not even a question of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=74.92s)]
*  Tolerance and respect to live and let live you have to be an advocate and a champion for their cause [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Whatever the cause of the day may be [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=87.88s)]
*  They're trying to divide us. They're racializing everything. They're stoking anti-white racism and actively working [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=90.48s)]
*  To undermine our God-given freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Now Rush Limbaugh's prediction from 30 years ago is pointing to exactly where we are today [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsms7jYtKNY&t=102.5s)]
