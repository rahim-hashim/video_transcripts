# To defend the Constitution, you have to know it: Former Green Beret
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM)
*  So every major government agency at your expense publishes hundreds of pages of guidelines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=0.0s)]
*  that promote absurd anti-white woke propaganda. The Wall Street Journal just obtained documents [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  from NASA which warn of something called micro inequities. They also learned the Department of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=12.64s)]
*  Veterans Affairs has a quote gender gingerbread person. It's also depressing if you think about [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=16.88s)]
*  it. It's one thing if it's happening at the Small Business Association but if it's happening at the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=23.04s)]
*  Pentagon it's a huge problem and it is. The Army now advises soldiers not to have any quote [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=27.28s)]
*  discomfort sharing with the female who has male genitalia. Really? So some dude's going to get [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=34.56s)]
*  in the shower with you pretending to be a girl and if you don't like it you're the weirdo. So a lot [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=40.56s)]
*  of soldiers are just leaving over all of this. Ivan Reiklin is one of them. He served 25 years as [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  both lieutenant colonel Andrew Green Beret but the moment the Pentagon started promoting VAX [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=51.36s)]
*  mandates and equity training he left. He retired. Now we asked him about that decision, a very sad [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=55.84s)]
*  decision from his point of view in a brand new episode of Tucker Carlson Today. Here's part of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=61.36000000000001s)]
*  the conversation. We've gone away from the focus of fighting and winning our nation's wars and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  defending the constitution. If we get back to that I think we'll be in a better position to start to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  repel from foreign adversaries which I kind of pivoted and talked about. Namely, you know [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  obviously the biggest one is China. Also Russia is helping and advise, I would argue, to make sure [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=84.48s)]
*  it expedites our demise. Iran is probably right there, not in a close third, but in third place. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  Do you know the answer? You raised a really interesting point when you said if you're going [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=100.56s)]
*  to remind the entire military force what its job is, which is to defend the constitution. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  You have to know the constitution. Thank you. So if I ask the question of Secretary Austin, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Milley, if I ask you, General, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=117.6s)]
*  what are you going to do when the 25th Amendment is violated? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Oh you don't know what the 25th Amendment is? How about what are you going to do when the 12th [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=126.0s)]
*  Amendment is violated? Oh you don't know that one? Let me go to the base document. What about [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=129.84s)]
*  Article 2, Section 1, Clause 2 or Article 1, Section 4? Most of these people are going to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=134.16s)]
*  look at you like deer in the headlights. I have no clue what you're talking about. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=139.52s)]
*  The thing is that our entire institutions have been, through the media, have pushed this, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=143.12s)]
*  whether it's all three branches of federal government, even at the state level, have been [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=148.72s)]
*  pushing this narrative to make people think that this is actually a, the extremism thing is a thing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  and it only applies to one side of the political ideology. And so in a sense some folks are [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=160.88s)]
*  convinced that that's true even though it's not. It's not based on fact. Others know that critical [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=167.44s)]
*  thinkers, I would say majority of my network is in the special ops and intel community, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=173.68s)]
*  and those that are even lean left of center, when I present the evidence in a very deliberate, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=179.44s)]
*  systematic manner, they know where I stand ideologically, they'll agree with the conclusion, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=187.28s)]
*  which does not align with what's being promulgated at the top. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=194.88s)]
*  But they don't want to lose their job. They don't want to lose their, you know, benefits. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=200.32s)]
*  It all comes down to that. It all comes down to safety, security, and they're willing to bend and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  budge on their moral, ethical and even legal principles. You can stream that full conversation [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  on Fox Nation right now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIVUEEAXlM&t=218.8s)]
