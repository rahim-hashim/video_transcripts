# Brittany Aldean speaks out on her fight to protect kids
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE)
*  Here's a pretty amazing story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=0.0s)]
*  Brittany Aldean is the wife of country music star Jason Aldean. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=2.92s)]
*  Recently she uploaded a video to Instagram that showed her putting on makeup. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=6.04s)]
*  It's on your screen right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=9.36s)]
*  And then she added this caption to the footage. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=10.96s)]
*  I'm recording. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=12.68s)]
*  I'd really like to thank my parents for not changing my gender when I went through my [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=13.68s)]
*  tomboy phase. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=17.0s)]
*  I love this girly life. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=18.28s)]
*  And then her husband responded with this caption. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=20.36s)]
*  He wrote, quote, I'm glad they didn't too, because you and I wouldn't have worked out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=21.96s)]
*  That was it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=25.94s)]
*  Now no sane society would have a problem with or even notice words like that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=27.26s)]
*  But in 2022, this is a thought crime you're required to believe that minors should be [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=32.46s)]
*  castrated by their parents. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=36.86s)]
*  So there was massive backlash online. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=38.72s)]
*  A country music singer called Cassidy Pope accused Aldean of wronging LGBTQ plus people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=41.78s)]
*  for writing that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=47.14s)]
*  And then a lunatic called Maren Morris, some kind of fake country music singer, went all [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  the way. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=53.42s)]
*  She wrote this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=54.42s)]
*  It's easy to be like not a scumbag human. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=55.42s)]
*  Sell your clip ins and zip it insurrection Barbie. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  And then of course, Brittany Aldean was attacked up and down the American media for telling [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=62.82s)]
*  a transphobic joke, which they never quoted at all. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=68.18s)]
*  You had no idea what she said. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=71.38s)]
*  We just showed you what she said. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=72.54s)]
*  They really attacked her. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=74.66s)]
*  To her great credit, she's not backing down. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=75.66s)]
*  In fact, she's got a new clothing line out called Don't Tread on Kids. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=77.1s)]
*  And we are honored to have Brittany Aldean join us tonight. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=79.9s)]
*  Brittany, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  The more I read about this, the more I was legitimately shocked by the dishonesty of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=84.1s)]
*  the response, by the viciousness, especially from that second woman. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=89.5s)]
*  Awful. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  Were you surprised by this? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=96.82s)]
*  Yes, I was extremely surprised. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=97.82s)]
*  In saying my response, I never thought that there was anything wrong with it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=100.86s)]
*  I'm advocating for children. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=105.58s)]
*  I think that children should not be allowed to make these life changing decisions at such [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=106.74s)]
*  a young age. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=111.06s)]
*  They are not mature enough. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=112.06s)]
*  They should have parents that love them and advocate for them regardless. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=113.62s)]
*  We have ages on everything, right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  We have it for cigarettes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  We have it for driving. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  We have it for military voting. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=123.0s)]
*  Yet, for some reason, people think that we can let a child choose their gender so young. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  It's very baffling to me. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=130.32s)]
*  Well, especially when that process is irreparable. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=131.78s)]
*  You wind up castrating children, removing their sex organs, making them sterile for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  life. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=142.10000000000002s)]
*  Huge consequences. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=143.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=144.1s)]
*  Huge consequences. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=145.1s)]
*  I think when you're older, if you choose to make those decisions, by all means. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=146.1s)]
*  But children are too young, not mature enough to make those decisions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  They're life changing, like you said. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=156.06s)]
*  They may not be able to have children one day. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  There's so many consequences to doing that at such a young age. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=160.18s)]
*  Us as parents, us as a society, regardless of political status, should be able to sit [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=163.5s)]
*  back, speak our minds about it, and fight for these children. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=170.3s)]
*  There's been a huge effort by corporate America, you've seen it in the NFL, and you've seen [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=173.9s)]
*  it in country music, to control the entertainment forms that middle class America likes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=177.46s)]
*  Country music is, of course, one of the biggest. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=182.8s)]
*  Please make us feel better and tell us that you know people in Nashville who've called [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  you personally to say they're on your side. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=188.18s)]
*  So much support. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=191.38s)]
*  So much support. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=193.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=194.12s)]
*  Especially people that have children. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=195.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=196.12s)]
*  Definitely, you have the other side of that too, and that's fine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=197.12s)]
*  People are entitled to their opinions, but that's just it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=200.44s)]
*  We as conservatives have a very hard time having an opinion, especially in society today, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=203.52s)]
*  in the media, in relationships, in the workplace, and it's very, very sad. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=209.28s)]
*  But a lot of support within Nashville and just friends and family, for sure. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=213.02s)]
*  They didn't even ask your opinion. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=216.8s)]
*  They immediately, and that second country music person, who I hope leaves country music [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=218.16s)]
*  immediately for the viciousness of her attacking you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=222.74s)]
*  She just attacked you, personally. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=225.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  And I've never had a conversation with either of these people. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  This is simply based on opinion and political status. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=231.48s)]
*  That's the worst. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=234.96s)]
*  We appreciate your bravery. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=236.48s)]
*  Brittany Aldean, thank you so much for coming on tonight. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=237.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvcmZ_Ug2XE&t=239.4s)]
