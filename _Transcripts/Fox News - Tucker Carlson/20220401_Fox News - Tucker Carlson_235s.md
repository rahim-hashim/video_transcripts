# Republican's bill would ban intel agencies from domestic spying
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8)
*  OK, so here's a question we know the answer to. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=0.0s)]
*  What's the point of American intel agencies? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=3.84s)]
*  Couldn't be clearer in the law. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=6.72s)]
*  The point of an American intel agency is to monitor what happens in other countries and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=8.8s)]
*  then report back to the President of the United States so that he can make better decisions [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=13.84s)]
*  about US foreign policy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=17.8s)]
*  Period. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=18.8s)]
*  That's why we have the CIA. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=19.8s)]
*  That's the only reason we do. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=20.8s)]
*  These agencies are not allowed to spy on American citizens because that would invalidate democracy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=21.88s)]
*  But they're doing it on a huge scale. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=28.72s)]
*  And they're doing it on direct orders from the Biden administration. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=31.84s)]
*  Not a conspiracy theory. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=35.04s)]
*  It's verified. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=36.92s)]
*  It's true. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=37.92s)]
*  Now, new legislation from Congress seeks to stop that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=38.92s)]
*  This legislation has been introduced by Congressman Chris Stewart of Utah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=42.44s)]
*  The Congressman joins us now to explain. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=45.92s)]
*  Congressman, first of all, thank you so much for doing this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=47.92s)]
*  This is illegal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  Nobody seems to care. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  We should care. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  What would your legislation do? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=53.16s)]
*  Well, to emphasize what you've already said, Tucker, the whole purpose of the IC intelligence [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=55.68s)]
*  community, NSA, CIA, and others is to concentrate on foreign threats, foreign terrorism of foreign [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=60.04s)]
*  nation states, Russia, China, North Korea. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=66.84s)]
*  It was never, ever intended that they would look at US persons until this administration [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=70.32s)]
*  comes along and says, you know, those other threats are important. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  But the real threat we're worried about is domestic violent extremism, DVEs they call [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=78.94s)]
*  them, white supremacy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=84.04s)]
*  And because this white supremacy threat is so great, which, by the way, is nonsense, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=85.72s)]
*  but by their thinking, because this is such a great threat, now we need to use the power, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=90.64s)]
*  the awesome tools that we give the National Security Agency or the CIA or the DIA. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=95.92s)]
*  We're compelled to use those upon US persons, the administration says. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=101.36s)]
*  And that's why you have a situation like about a year ago where the Office of Director of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=105.36s)]
*  National Intelligence, not the FBI, not Homeland Security, the DNI, using the tools of the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=110.64s)]
*  National Counterterrorism Center, provides a briefing to Congress on what? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=116.48s)]
*  White supremacy on domestic terrorism. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=121.16s)]
*  It should enrage Americans that they would think that they would allow them to use this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=124.04s)]
*  awesome power. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=128.56s)]
*  Hey, if you think you want to build an American KGB, if you think that's a good idea, then [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=129.56s)]
*  keep going down this road. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=134.72s)]
*  And if you think it's a horrible, fearsome idea, then please work with me. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=136.16s)]
*  I'm talking to my members of Congress. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=141.16s)]
*  Please work with me to try and stop it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=143.6s)]
*  So they've spied on this show. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=145.68s)]
*  They've admitted it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  I've spoken directly to two sitting members of Congress whose job it is to oversee the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  intelligence agency who told me directly that they were being spied on by the intelligence [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=152.74s)]
*  agencies and they didn't do anything about it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=157.32s)]
*  I wonder how many members of Congress are too intimidated to push back the powers of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  these agencies. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=163.36s)]
*  Well, I guess we're going to find out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=164.84s)]
*  But, you know, and it's not just members of the press. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we know that the CIA and Director Brennan lied about it when they were spying [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=169.28s)]
*  on members of the Senate. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, for heaven's sakes, Tucker, if the last four or five years have taught us anything, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  it has surely taught us that senior members of the FBI and Department of Justice clearly [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=178.84s)]
*  were deceptive to Congress, deceptive to the FISA courts, deceptive to the American people. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  And now, once again, they want to increase that ability, to enhance that ability by drawing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  in these other agencies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=195.4s)]
*  And once again, there's no reason for it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  There's no need for it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=200.72s)]
*  By the way, there's enough terror threats and other threats for them to it's not like [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=201.72s)]
*  they've got extra bandwidth, like they don't have anything to do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=205.12s)]
*  And very clearly, the Department of Justice and FBI, that's their responsibility, not [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  the CIA, not the NSA. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  So nicely put. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  We are rooting for you, Congressman Chris Stewart. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  I hope you'll come back and let us know who didn't vote for this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=219.32s)]
*  That'll be interesting. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=221.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=222.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxBvgliEp8&t=223.76s)]
