# Elon Musk: If anyone would know about aliens, it probably would be me
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw)
*  Elon Musk also runs the world's biggest rocket company, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=0.0s)]
*  so we couldn't resist asking him about aliens. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=2.92s)]
*  Of course we did. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=5.4s)]
*  A lot of people ask me, you know, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=8.98s)]
*  where are the aliens? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  And I think if anyone would know about aliens on Earth, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=13.96s)]
*  it would probably be me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=17.32s)]
*  I would think. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=18.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very familiar with space stuff. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Tomorrow night, his full answer on that, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  and also his views on why civilizations rise [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  and why they fall and what we can do about it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=32.08s)]
*  Elon Musk has famously decided [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=34.92s)]
*  to help repopulate the Earth himself. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=37.04s)]
*  We're gonna tell you his thinking behind that, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=39.64s)]
*  or rather he will explain it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  A fascinating second part of our interview with Elon Musk [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=42.68s)]
*  tomorrow night right here at 8 p.m. Eastern. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=46.16s)]

*  what happens to your tax dollars, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=54.16s)]
*  they're sending it to scientists [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMGNF1DzPEw&t=57.2s)]
