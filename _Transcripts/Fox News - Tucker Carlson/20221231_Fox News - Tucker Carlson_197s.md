# Tulsi Gabbard: Are we making the most of our time?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc)
*  Good evening and aloha everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a special edition of Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=2.44s)]
*  I'm Tulsi Gabbard standing in for Tucker. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=5.5s)]
*  I'm so grateful to have had the privilege of wearing the cloth of this country now for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=8.26s)]
*  almost 20 years, currently serving as [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=12.6s)]
*  a Lieutenant Colonel and Civil Affairs Officer in the US Army Reserves. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=14.8s)]
*  But my first deployment was to Iraq in 2005, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  where I served in a medical unit in a camp that was about 40 miles north of Baghdad. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=21.6s)]
*  And one of the things that struck me when I first arrived at that camp in 2005 was this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=27.0s)]
*  big sign at the main gate that read, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=32.2s)]
*  is today the day? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=35.4s)]
*  Now I saw that sign almost every day for the year that I was there, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=38.1s)]
*  a reminder that any day could be our last. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=42.3s)]
*  And I was confronted with just how true this was as I worked in a medical unit every day [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  experiencing the high human cost of war. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=50.8s)]
*  And it caused me to reflect, what am I doing with my life? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=54.7s)]
*  Am I making the most of every day that I have to do my best to be of service to God and to others? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=58.7s)]
*  Now the question on that sign, is today the day? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=65.5s)]
*  Is just as relevant to every one of us now here at home as it was to us in Iraq so many years ago? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=69.9s)]
*  I spoke to Tucker recently on my podcast, The Tulsi Gabbard Show, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=77.5s)]
*  about this most important topic. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=81.4s)]
*  Here's part of our conversation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=84.0s)]
*  I do feel great. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=85.30000000000001s)]
*  That's literally what matters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=86.0s)]
*  I'm moving toward death at like pretty high speed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  And one of the first things to go is my sight and I can't text without my glasses. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  I've been feeling that way since I was very young, moving towards death at a rapid rate. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, because we are. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=101.0s)]
*  And the root of all wisdom is knowing that, you know? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=103.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  I feel like people who are aware of death are way happier and lighter because they're not denying, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=107.7s)]
*  you know, what's just biologically intrinsic. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=115.4s)]
*  Like you can't get away from it, you know? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  Because if you acknowledge the reality of death and that it's not just something like, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=120.4s)]
*  okay, I'm going to set my clock. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=125.2s)]
*  It's going to come at this time, at this place, at this age. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=126.4s)]
*  Then you realize how precious life is, right? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=130.4s)]
*  Yes, and you're not in control. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=132.3s)]
*  You look at, you know, the problems we have in mainstream media, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=134.4s)]
*  the problems we have within leaders in just about every sector in our society. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=137.5s)]
*  They're chasing all the wrong things, whether it's money or power or attention or, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  you know, so-called love, affirmation, you know, fame. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=147.5s)]
*  And all of these things just come down to this refusal to even take a moment [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=152.0s)]
*  and ask the all-important question is like, what is the purpose of my life? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  I know! [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=161.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=162.8s)]
*  What comes after? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=163.2s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=164.2s)]
*  How could you miss that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=165.6s)]
*  Now, as we look to the year ahead, we're reminded about what is most important in life [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  and in death, that we find hope and inner peace in God's unconditional love for every one of us [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=174.6s)]
*  and that true happiness is found in service to God and to others. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=182.1s)]
*  And that's it for this week. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=193.2s)]
*  We're back with more of the world and changing your life from Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfaMaraBGc&t=194.89999999999998s)]
