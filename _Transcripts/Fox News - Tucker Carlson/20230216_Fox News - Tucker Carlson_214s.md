# JD Vance: Ohio residents are scared about this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY)
*  After ignoring the disaster in East Palestine, Ohio, for nearly two weeks, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=0.0s)]
*  the Biden administration now says the area is totally safe. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Just as long as you're wearing a hazmat suit or better yet, as long as you don't actually visit it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=7.76s)]
*  All the dead fish and the chlorine smell in the air, whatever, totally normal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=12.48s)]
*  Your nose does not know. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=17.6s)]
*  JD Vance is a senator from the state of Ohio. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=19.92s)]
*  He's also from Ohio and he had some questions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=22.56s)]
*  So he went to East Palestine, which seemed like a pretty simple step. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=25.44s)]
*  A lot of people can't manage it, but he did. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=29.12s)]
*  And after visiting, he challenged the EPA administrator, Michael Regan, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=31.44s)]
*  to drink a glass of tap water in the town of East Palestine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=37.04s)]
*  Weirdly, Michael Regan has not accepted that challenge. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=42.08s)]
*  We are grateful to have Senator JD Vance of Ohio with us tonight. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=45.6s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  I notice a lot of the people who are reassuring us about how fine East Palestine is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  don't really want to go there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=57.28s)]
*  In fact, they've avoided going there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=58.72s)]
*  Do you think Regan will drink the tap water? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=60.72s)]
*  I don't suspect that he will, Tucker. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=65.92s)]
*  And a lot of residents, unfortunately, are not comfortable drinking the tap water either. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=67.36s)]
*  And it's easy not to see why, Tucker. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=71.2s)]
*  The thing that I came away from after visiting today is that, one, residents are very, very [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=73.28s)]
*  scared, obviously, but they are also not getting answers from their authorities [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=80.48s)]
*  about exactly what's going on, what's being done to clean up the disaster. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=84.08s)]
*  And on that point in particular, Tucker, the railroad has completely failed to clean up [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=87.76s)]
*  the toxic soil that's leaking into the riverways, into the waterways, and into the groundwater. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=95.12s)]
*  So there's this question about testing and whether we're testing the water enough. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=101.04s)]
*  The question that I have is why haven't they cleaned up the contaminated soil [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=105.68s)]
*  that's going to eventually contaminate the groundwater no matter what? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=109.28s)]
*  So you've been criticized for suggesting that maybe people who are still in East Palestine [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  drink bottled water, and that's scaremongering because apparently we should just follow the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=120.24s)]
*  science and do what we're told. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=125.44s)]
*  Why would someone criticize you for counseling caution? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=126.96s)]
*  You know, I have no idea, Tucker. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=132.8s)]
*  I think that there is a complete refusal to deal with the fact that a lot of residents [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=134.24s)]
*  are freaked out on the ground. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=138.32s)]
*  Obviously, people want to get back to their lives. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=140.0s)]
*  They also want to know that they're safe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=141.76s)]
*  And the thing that's very clear, if you talk to the EPA, if you talk to the CDC, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=143.28s)]
*  they cannot tell us what a clean threshold is for the water. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=148.56s)]
*  So on the one hand, you have to measure the water to know how much of this contaminant is in it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=153.12s)]
*  On the other hand, you have to know at what level the contaminant is low enough [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=158.0s)]
*  that it's clean water, that it's safe for humans to drink. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=163.12s)]
*  We've been completely unable to get a good answer from any federal authorities to that question. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=165.92s)]
*  And if I can't get that answer, and I'm a United States senator, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=170.96s)]
*  that suggests that the people of East Palestine who want to be cautious [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  have every right to do it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=177.44s)]
*  The simple fact is, Tucker, that unless we go in and study the effect of vinyl chloride [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=179.2s)]
*  on human beings, we're never going to be able to say with confidence [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=185.04s)]
*  what is going to happen to the residents of East Palestine. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=188.88s)]
*  They want to rebuild their community. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=191.44s)]
*  They want to get back to normal life. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=193.04s)]
*  But they can't do it unless the government does its job. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=194.64s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=197.92s)]
*  By the way, if you say you're an environmentalist and care about the environment, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  you should care about the air and the soil and the water. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=202.0s)]
*  Climate is not the environment, I would say. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=206.64s)]
*  JD Vance, senator from Ohio who took the time to visit one of his own communities. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=213.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jlZpFHZKY&t=213.6s)]
