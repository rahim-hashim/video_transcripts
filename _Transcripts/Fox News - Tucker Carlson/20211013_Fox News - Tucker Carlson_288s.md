# Attorney General is ‘weak as water’ upholding DOJ’s political independence: Hume
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 13, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M)
*  We don't tell you a lot about poll numbers because they're unreliable and they really [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=0.0s)]
*  are just a snapshot. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=3.08s)]
*  But holy smokes, Joe Biden's poll numbers are bad just across the board. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=4.08s)]
*  All Americans disapprove of his border policies, his handling of inflation, the debacle in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=7.88s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=13.0s)]
*  And if all of that was not enough, the Daily Mail reporting today that Joe Biden could [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=14.0s)]
*  be implicated in an FBI investigation into his son Hunter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=17.44s)]
*  To assess all of this is Britt Hume. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=21.78s)]
*  He's our senior political analyst here at Fox News and for good reason. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=23.5s)]
*  Britt, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=27.44s)]
*  It's not an age question. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=30.04s)]
*  It's a wisdom question. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=31.2s)]
*  So at this moment, according to the Daily Mail... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=32.6s)]
*  Tucker, it's an age question. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=35.76s)]
*  It's just a slim percentage. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=37.76s)]
*  So the Daily Mail says that Biden may have funded some of Hunter's extracurricular activities [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=40.2s)]
*  and that they shared bank accounts. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  If that's true, that sounds like a big deal, is it? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=49.0s)]
*  Well, it would be a big deal, Tucker, if it was shown that Hunter's business activities [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=52.8s)]
*  some of which are very questionable, redounded to his father's financial benefit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=59.48s)]
*  Because clearly Hunter Biden crossed ethical lines in the activities he engaged in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=67.84s)]
*  And it was always this howling conflict of interest of his serving, doing business in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=73.28s)]
*  Ukraine when his father was responsible for policy related to Ukraine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=77.4s)]
*  That's been on the books for a long time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=81.32s)]
*  We've all known that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=82.52s)]
*  If it were to come out that Joe Biden himself or his campaign or whatever profited from [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=83.52s)]
*  that, that would move the matter up quite another notch and would add one more thing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=88.36s)]
*  to the reasons why Joe Biden's popularity rating has been plummeting, as you pointed out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=92.28s)]
*  I hate even to say this, but given the behavior of the attorney general over the past couple of weeks, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  likening parents to domestic terrorists, can we be certain that the Department of Justice will [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=102.04s)]
*  conduct a free and fair investigation into the president's son and maybe the president? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=107.0s)]
*  No. In a word, no. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  The one thing that this Merrick Garland has turned out to be for all of his reputation [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=115.88s)]
*  as being a fine jurist and a man who deserved a seat on the Supreme Court, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=119.8s)]
*  he appears to be weak as water when it comes to upholding the independence of the Department [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=123.64s)]
*  of Justice and keeping the Justice Department out of politically motivated investigations. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=127.96s)]
*  This business of having the FBI looking into parents' behaviors, if it were some kind of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=133.4s)]
*  terrorism it seems to me is something that no sensible attorney general would ever allow [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  himself to be involved in or give the green light to, and yet he did it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=142.44s)]
*  So no, I don't think we can depend on that at all. It might depend on investigative [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=146.44s)]
*  journalism to try to uncover this or congressional investigations if the Republicans ever get control [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=150.44s)]
*  of one or both houses of Congress. Maybe the New York Post will report on the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=155.4s)]
*  contents of this. Oh wait. So I mean, given that this story, which we first learned about in October [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=159.72s)]
*  of last year, a year ago, was squelched completely by the media titans, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=166.36s)]
*  I wonder if we can be certain we'll get the details this year. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=171.56s)]
*  Well, I would think if the New York Post comes forward again with another story about Hunter [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  Biden, I trust and hope, at least, that the mainstream media outlets who behaved so [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  disgracefully last year when the New York Post broke the earlier story would see the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=185.96s)]
*  error of their ways and be willing to pick up the story. I would not expect, however, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=191.96s)]
*  that they would sic their investigative teams on it. They might just follow the story as it appears, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  you know, day to day. That would be about the most we could hope for, but that's a lot better [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=200.68s)]
*  than nothing, which is what we got last year from these, I think, politically corrupt news organizations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=203.88s)]
*  They'd have to pull a lot of guys off the QAnon army beat to do that, though. Do you think they'd [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=209.32s)]
*  be willing? Well, I think they'd be hesitant. It's a sad state of affairs, but I think there'd [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=213.4s)]
*  be enough noise made about this that the whole country would be able to hear it. No question [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=220.28s)]
*  about it. This is the border situation, which was ignored for many months by mainstream media [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=224.76s)]
*  outlets, finally broke through. So, you know, these things can't be suppressed forever. At least one [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=230.84s)]
*  hopes not. So in 20 seconds, what effect does this have on the midterms, which are a year from now? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=235.48s)]
*  Well, anything that redounds to the disapproval of Joe Biden hurts his party in the midterms, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=242.44s)]
*  and a president's approval ratings and standing with the public is always a major factor in [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=246.52s)]
*  midterms, especially a president's first midterm after he takes office, in which the president's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=250.52s)]
*  party historically does badly. So the outlook in the House, at least, for the Democrats is very poor, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=257.88s)]
*  and it might spill over to the Senate as well, although the map there favors the Democrats. But [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=262.44s)]
*  a big wave election would sweep the Democrats out in both Houses, in my view. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=266.76s)]
*  Well deserved. Britt Hume, thank you for that analysis. Great to see you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBym_JuKe0M&t=271.72s)]
