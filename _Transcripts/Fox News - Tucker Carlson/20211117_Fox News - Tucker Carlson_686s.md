# Tucker: This is a challenge to civilization
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 17, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI)
*  We are here on the seat of the Patriot Awards in the good Hollywood, Hollywood, Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=0.0s)]
*  You can stream the whole thing right after the show. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  It's on FoxNation.com, but we recommend it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=16.82s)]
*  But first, good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=19.06s)]
*  So there's a difference between lying and propaganda, and it's worth knowing what it [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=21.78s)]
*  is. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=24.62s)]
*  All propaganda is lying, but not all lying is propaganda. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=25.62s)]
*  So what's the difference between the two? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=28.38s)]
*  Here's what lying is. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=30.5s)]
*  Think about the moments in your own life when you have lied. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=31.5s)]
*  Most of the time you do it because you have done something that you're ashamed of and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=34.62s)]
*  you're hoping nobody's going to find out. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=37.54s)]
*  When you're caught, as inevitably you are caught, you shade the truth. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=39.46s)]
*  So someone says to you, you're drunk. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=43.18s)]
*  And you say, no, I'm not. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=44.58s)]
*  I've only had three beers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=46.14s)]
*  But actually you had eight beers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  You're lying. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=49.86s)]
*  That's what lying is. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=50.86s)]
*  Propaganda is very different from that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=51.94s)]
*  Propaganda is not a shading of the truth. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=53.66s)]
*  Propaganda is a complete inversion of the truth. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=55.9s)]
*  You're drunk, somebody tells you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=59.06s)]
*  No I'm not, you reply. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=60.62s)]
*  You're the one who's drunk. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=62.46s)]
*  You've had eight beers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=63.9s)]
*  It's shameful and I'm disgusted by your drunkenness. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=65.02s)]
*  That's what propaganda looks like. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=68.78s)]
*  It's the mirror image of reality. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=69.86s)]
*  It's the exact opposite of the truth. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=71.34s)]
*  And it is always delivered with ferocious aggression. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=73.58s)]
*  Propaganda tends to bewilder people, to confuse them when they first hear it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  It's so completely and obviously untrue. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=81.1s)]
*  What is this, you think? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=83.64s)]
*  And yet for that very reason, because it's so ridiculous, so absurd, propaganda tends [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=85.06s)]
*  to be effective. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=89.7s)]
*  People assume that lies that bold have got to be true. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  Something about the human brain reaches that conclusion and always has. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  And that's why propaganda has always been a feature of society, especially now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=97.48s)]
*  It's why we're now swimming in propaganda. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=100.88s)]
*  January 6th was an armed insurrection, they screamed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=103.22s)]
*  Russia is the real threat. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=106.66s)]
*  The 2020 election was perfectly fair. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=108.42s)]
*  COVID is more dangerous than opioids. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  No, really it is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=112.62s)]
*  It's all true. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=113.62s)]
*  We can give you countless examples of this in action and you would recognize every one [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=115.26s)]
*  of them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=118.58s)]
*  But here's one from today's headlines. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=119.58s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse is a white supremacist. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=121.42s)]
*  Now you're hearing that claim constantly from media figures and from politicians. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=124.86s)]
*  As a factual matter, in case anybody cares, that is a lie. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=128.74s)]
*  There is no evidence whatsoever that Kyle Rittenhouse is a white supremacist, whatever [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=132.46s)]
*  that term is supposed to mean. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=136.34s)]
*  There is precisely no racial angle at all to this story. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=138.1s)]
*  None. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=142.18s)]
*  Of the four people directly involved in the Kyle Rittenhouse shootings, all four of them [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=143.18s)]
*  were white. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=146.82s)]
*  So you might not like Kyle Rittenhouse, but if you're an honest person, you would have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=147.82s)]
*  to concede that racism had nothing to do with what he did. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=151.38s)]
*  How could it? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=154.9s)]
*  Why would a white supremacist shoot white people? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=155.9s)]
*  It doesn't even make sense. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=158.3s)]
*  But that has not stopped them from telling you the opposite or even slowed them down. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=160.74s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden just two days after the shootings in Kenosha, writing the first draft of what [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=164.9s)]
*  turned out to be a long propaganda campaign. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=169.54000000000002s)]
*  He has espoused some views. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=172.98s)]
*  He's part of a youth police group. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  He was holding a long gun. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=176.94s)]
*  He was out and about. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=178.22s)]
*  Nobody restrained him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=179.22s)]
*  What are your concerns about the involvement of others, perhaps he, but others who are [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  white militia people stirring this trouble? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=187.14s)]
*  Oh, I'm very concerned about it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=190.17999999999998s)]
*  Again, you saw what got me involved in this race. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=192.5s)]
*  I hadn't planned on running in the first place was what happened in Charlottesville. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  The same kind of appeal to these guys don't use a dog whistle. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=199.98s)]
*  They use a bullhorn. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=204.54s)]
*  They use a bullhorn. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=205.54s)]
*  And this is a 17 year old young man. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=206.54s)]
*  I don't know anything about him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  All I know is that there's some reporting about a connection to a militia in Illinois. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=211.54s)]
*  So really, you should save that tape. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=217.54s)]
*  It is a textbook example of what's going on, of what they do. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=219.62s)]
*  Notice the framing of that conversation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  So the propagandist from NBC News doesn't come out and call Kyle Rittenhouse a white [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=226.04s)]
*  supremacist. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=229.76s)]
*  She can't do that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=230.76s)]
*  The shootings just happened hours before. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=231.76s)]
*  The facts are too fresh. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=233.44s)]
*  There was no evidence that Kyle Rittenhouse had ugly racial views, much less that he was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=235.04s)]
*  motivated to shoot people because of those views. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=238.56s)]
*  And everyone who's paying attention at the time knew that very well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=241.04s)]
*  So instead of making the claim directly, the liar from NBC News stealthily broadens the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=244.16s)]
*  question. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=249.2s)]
*  Are you concerned about others who are white militia people? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  But wait a second. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=254.12s)]
*  What other white militia people? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=255.64s)]
*  Where are these people? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=257.36s)]
*  What are you talking about exactly? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=258.36s)]
*  But the liar from NBC News never tells us what she's talking about. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=260.82s)]
*  That's not the point. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  She has given her candidate, Joe Biden, the opportunity to take it from there, which of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  course he immediately does. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=268.96s)]
*  That's the point of the setup. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=270.4s)]
*  And then Biden goes on to invoke the protests in Charlottesville, Virginia from years before, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=271.84s)]
*  which have precisely nothing to do with anything that happened in Kenosha, Wisconsin in the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=276.24s)]
*  summer of 2020. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=280.0s)]
*  But they didn't need to be connected factually. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=281.94s)]
*  The point was obvious. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=283.68s)]
*  Everyone watching understood the point. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=284.76s)]
*  The point was Kyle Rittenhouse is a dangerous racist. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=286.0s)]
*  And by the way, anyone who would defend Kyle Rittenhouse, probably a dangerous racist too. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  Maybe one of those white militia people. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=292.8s)]
*  You see how that works? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=295.68s)]
*  It works by indirection and stealth and dishonesty. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=296.68s)]
*  But of course you see it because you see it every day because it never ended. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=299.0s)]
*  They're still telling you the same thing now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=303.36s)]
*  And because they never stopped repeating that lie, a lot of people now assume that it must [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=305.44s)]
*  be true. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=308.76s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse, he's a white supremacist, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=309.76s)]
*  Many people think that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=311.44s)]
*  Why wouldn't they? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=312.44s)]
*  So why have they been doing this for 15 months? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=314.68s)]
*  Well now it's obvious. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=317.2s)]
*  If Kyle Rittenhouse wasn't actually what he was, which was a 17-year-old lifeguard who [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=318.76s)]
*  came to Kenosha to clean antifa graffiti off the walls of school, if he was something else [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=322.76s)]
*  entirely, if he was an armed bigot, a member of some kind of white supremacist militia, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=326.6s)]
*  then the trial looks very, very different. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  If that's true, then this trial is no longer about the principle of self-defense. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=333.72s)]
*  It's no longer about whether Kyle Rittenhouse's rifle was legal under Wisconsin law. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=336.44s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  It's about something much bigger than that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  If their lies are true, it means this trial is about whether black people can continue [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=342.68s)]
*  to live in the United States without being in fear of being murdered by white supremacist [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=346.44s)]
*  militiamen like Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, after much repetition at this point, many Americans believe that's exactly [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=353.08s)]
*  what the trial is about. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=358.66s)]
*  And they believe it because they keep hearing it on MSNBC. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=360.16s)]
*  There are only so many acceptable losses that white supremacy is willing to accept. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=363.32s)]
*  If Derek Chauvin is going to jail, you had best believe that Ahmaud Arbery's murderers, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=369.36s)]
*  people like Kyle Rittenhouse, are going to be defended with all that this culture has [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=373.44s)]
*  because they have to make sure that the message is sent, that white men will continue to control [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=378.2s)]
*  these systems and that the rest of us should be living in fear. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=384.48s)]
*  If Kyle Rittenhouse is acquitted, quote, the rest of us should be living in fear. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=389.0s)]
*  Now, why would we be living in fear? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  Because Kyle Rittenhouse might go on to shoot other convicted child rapists and violent [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=394.68s)]
*  criminals who are actually trying to murder him. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=398.6s)]
*  That's the threat? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=400.96s)]
*  How afraid should the rest of us be of that? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=402.12s)]
*  Once again, that claim doesn't even make sense, but it doesn't need to. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=404.76s)]
*  The fact that it's nonsensical does not diminish in any way the emotional power of those words. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=409.12s)]
*  The rest of us should be living in fear. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=413.66s)]
*  Imagine hearing that on live television from someone you're supposed to trust. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=416.52s)]
*  It would scare the hell out of you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=419.2s)]
*  Yes, it would. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=420.48s)]
*  And of course, that's the point of saying it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=421.48s)]
*  But there's another point, too, and that point is to subvert our system of justice. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=423.78s)]
*  American justice is based on the principle of equality, the principle that all of us [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=428.84s)]
*  are equal under the law, no matter what we look like, no matter who our parents were, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=432.02s)]
*  no matter where we came from. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=436.58s)]
*  That's called equality, and until very recently, our leaders were proud to offer it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=438.38s)]
*  Equity is something very, very different. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=443.5s)]
*  In fact, it's the opposite of equality. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=445.41999999999996s)]
*  If you think equity is the point of the justice system, then you don't care about the details. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=448.17999999999995s)]
*  You're not interested in the evidence. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=452.44s)]
*  You're not interested in who is actually guilty or innocent before the law. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=454.48s)]
*  What you care about instead is the appearance of the defendants, the identity of the people [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=458.64s)]
*  who are convicted and acquitted. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=464.08s)]
*  According to the principles of equity, how you were born determines whether or not you [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=466.48s)]
*  are guilty. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=470.88s)]
*  That's equity. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=471.88s)]
*  And it's not a fringe theory anymore. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=472.96s)]
*  According to Joe Biden himself, equity is the organizing principle of this White House. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=474.56s)]
*  He said so the day he was inaugurated. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=479.0s)]
*  But in order to replace equality in our justice system and every other institution with equity, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=481.72s)]
*  that means you have to tear down the system we currently have and have used for the last [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=487.54s)]
*  250 years. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=491.48s)]
*  That's not easy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=492.48s)]
*  It's a big assignment. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=493.48s)]
*  How do you do it? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=494.48s)]
*  Well, in the justice system, there's no faster way to tear it down than by calling judges [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=495.48s)]
*  racist, which, needless to say, is exactly what they're doing now. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=499.48s)]
*  He has made a series of decisions. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=503.8s)]
*  Each one perhaps may be individually defensible, but in totality lead to the impression of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=506.4s)]
*  a biased racist judge with his Trump rally cell phone that is trying to get rid of the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=512.88s)]
*  House a walk. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=520.28s)]
*  The racist judge. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  So that's a very heavy thing to say about anyone, and particularly a sitting judge, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=523.64s)]
*  in the middle of a murder trial. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  So the question is, is the judge actually a racist? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=529.0799999999999s)]
*  And the answer, as you know by now, is that no, there's no evidence of that at all. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=532.0s)]
*  And the man who just claimed the judge was racist knows there's no evidence of it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=536.24s)]
*  The man who just claimed it, by the way, went to Harvard Law School, he's not stupid, he [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=539.52s)]
*  knows what the facts are, he just doesn't care what the facts are, whatever it takes. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=542.64s)]
*  So this way of looking at the world, intentionally denying reality for the sake of a desired [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=547.96s)]
*  outcome is often called postmodernism. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=552.44s)]
*  But that's not quite right. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  In fact, this is pre-modern. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=556.76s)]
*  This is an instinct older than civilization itself, and in fact a challenge to civilization [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=559.1s)]
*  itself. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=563.32s)]
*  This is the kind of thinking that leads to tribalism. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=564.32s)]
*  Tribalism is the belief that my team is always right and your team is barely human. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  Tribalism has been around for as long as people have been around, it's never gone away, it [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=572.32s)]
*  just lurks beneath the surface of societies, all societies. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=575.6s)]
*  One of the main goals of any civilization is to suppress tribalism so that we can live [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=578.7600000000001s)]
*  together without killing one another. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  So you should be concerned when it re-emerges in public, and boy has it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=585.5200000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=590.12s)]
*  This Carl Rittenhouse trial, it reminded a lot of people of something, something, I just [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=591.36s)]
*  can't remember what it was. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=597.68s)]
*  Oh, the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, in which Brett Kavanaugh, who had been accused by [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=598.88s)]
*  a high school friend of committing sexual abuse of her, cried his way through the hearings [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=604.72s)]
*  to make him a permanent member and associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=612.72s)]
*  And his tears turned out to be more powerful than the tears of Christine Blasey Ford, which [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=619.84s)]
*  were the tears of an alleged victim. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=625.6s)]
*  But in America, there's a thing about both white vigilantism and white tears, particularly [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=628.72s)]
*  male white tears. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=637.24s)]
*  So that is a currently employed MSNBC anchor, another Harvard graduate, not an employee [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  of Radio Rwanda. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=644.64s)]
*  And that person is telling us what she really thinks in a TikTok video. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=646.68s)]
*  White tears! [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=650.0s)]
*  She mocks the very idea. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=651.38s)]
*  People that evil can't cry. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=653.2399999999999s)]
*  They don't have human emotions because they're not really human. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  You don't have to care about them. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=657.52s)]
*  They don't qualify for your compassion. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=659.16s)]
*  You can laugh as they weep and feel good about it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=661.2199999999999s)]
*  You often hear the word dehumanize. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=665.76s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=667.4s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=668.54s)]
*  So you wonder how long this can go on in our country before something really important [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=669.54s)]
*  brings. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDLmMzS1mI&t=673.4799999999999s)]
