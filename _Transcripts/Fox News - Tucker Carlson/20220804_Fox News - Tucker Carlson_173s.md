# Ron DeSantis blasts leftist prosecutor
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ)
*  Well, as promised, Governor DeSantis joins us right now to discuss why he did this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=5.16s)]
*  So this is kind of a big move, it seems like. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=8.08s)]
*  Why did you do it? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=10.34s)]
*  Well, Tucker, you documented the destruction that we've seen with these Soros prosecutors [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=11.34s)]
*  around the country, where they basically take it upon themselves to determine which laws [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=17.44s)]
*  should be followed and which laws should not be followed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=22.72s)]
*  And I can tell you in Florida's Constitution, that Constitution vests the veto power in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=26.2s)]
*  the governor, not an individual district attorney or state attorney where they can pick and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=30.8s)]
*  choose. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=35.44s)]
*  And so I asked my staff to review all state attorneys in the state of Florida. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=36.44s)]
*  I wanted to see who was picking and choosing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  And this is the guy that all the line prosecutors, all the law enforcement said he thinks he [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=43.04s)]
*  can pick and choose which laws. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=49.72s)]
*  And he actually signed letters saying he wouldn't enforce laws against transgender surgeries [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=51.16s)]
*  for minors, laws protecting the right to life. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=57.16s)]
*  And then he has all these policies in his agency that are called presumptive non-prosecution. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=60.76s)]
*  No, the law is presumptively enforced. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=65.52s)]
*  That's not something that's acceptable. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=68.84s)]
*  And so we, there today, we made the decision. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=70.92s)]
*  The jarring thing about it, though, Tucker, I had all these sheriffs from the area there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=73.16s)]
*  I had the former police chief in Tampa. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=77.72s)]
*  There's a lot of line prosecutors in that office that are very happy that this was done. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  And so we took it seriously. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  We did a thorough review and we pulled the trigger today. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=87.48s)]
*  I mean, it's so obviously unconstitutional. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  Legislators make the laws. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=94.08s)]
*  Judges decide whether they're consistent with the Constitution. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=95.92s)]
*  Prosecutors have no role in that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=98.68s)]
*  They don't have the legal right, the constitutional right to selectively enforce the law. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=99.68s)]
*  Or am I missing something? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=104.04s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=105.04s)]
*  But here's what Soros is doing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  He's actually smart on his part. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=108.36s)]
*  They can't get these things enacted in a legislature where you're just going to let criminals run. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=110.2s)]
*  So what they do, he will get involved in these Democrat primaries in a Democrat area. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=115.64s)]
*  He'll flush a million dollars to get the radical to win the primary. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=120.64s)]
*  Then they usually win the general because of the party affiliation difference in the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=124.4s)]
*  jurisdiction. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=127.76s)]
*  So then you get them in there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=128.84s)]
*  And what they do is they want to change the criminal justice system through non-enforcement. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=130.44s)]
*  So it's a total end run around our constitutional system. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=135.76s)]
*  The results obviously have been destructive around the country, but it also really undermines [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=139.64s)]
*  the idea that ours is supposed to be a government of laws, not a government of individual men. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=144.84s)]
*  Even if I agreed with the results, I would hate it because it's a subversion of democracy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=150.92s)]
*  And finally, someone's doing something more than wine. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Governor DeSantis, for coming on. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=158.04s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=159.84s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=160.84s)]

*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C0aJK63vGQ&t=170.64s)]
