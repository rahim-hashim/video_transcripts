# Tucker: They care more about pronouns than human life
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=0.0s)]
*  If there's one thing your average liberal understands perfectly well, it's that there's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=3.6s)]
*  safety in numbers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=7.96s)]
*  Don't go out alone, bring 80 million people with you, it's safer that way. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  There is a reason, a fundamental reason that Democrats are natural joiners and organizers [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=15.24s)]
*  and petition signers and that their highest virtue is conformity. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  They know that as long as they're all wearing the same uniform, they'll probably be okay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=25.9s)]
*  This is why you'll see one person in Brookline or Bethesda raise a Ukrainian flag in the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=30.779999999999998s)]
*  yard and the very next day, everybody on the street will have one too. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=35.22s)]
*  Suddenly it's an entire neighborhood of foreign policy experts all specializing in Eastern [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=40.5s)]
*  European border disputes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=47.34s)]
*  Just last year, these very same people were all eminent virologists, every one of them [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=48.78s)]
*  with passionate views on the details of pandemic management. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=53.32s)]
*  This is in other words, not a movement of rugged individuals. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=58.32s)]
*  This is a party based on the idea of the group, the bureaucracy, the blob. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=61.74s)]
*  It's the party of weak, fearful people who are huddled together for collective power. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=66.92s)]
*  When the Democratic Party speaks, it is always with one voice, often in a North Korean accent. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=72.28s)]
*  One thing the party often speaks about is gun control. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=78.76s)]
*  No American has the right to own an effective firearm, a firearm that does what firearms [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=82.22s)]
*  are supposed to. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=87.86s)]
*  They'll tell you this at length. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=88.86s)]
*  Having a gun like that is just too much autonomy for you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=90.38s)]
*  If it continues, you may start to believe that you're a free citizen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=93.18s)]
*  And we can't allow that and we won't. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=96.72s)]
*  Joe Biden, for instance, makes this point regularly. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=98.98s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=102.3s)]
*  We're living in a country awash in weapons of war. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=103.3s)]
*  I got it done once. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to do it again. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=107.74s)]
*  Eliminate assault weapon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=109.22s)]
*  It's time to ban these. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=110.86s)]
*  It's time to ban these weapons. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=113.7s)]
*  The right to bear arms is not an absolute right that dominates all others. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=115.34s)]
*  You don't need an RAR-15. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=118.66s)]
*  I'm serious. Think about it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=121.7s)]
*  Ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=123.34s)]
*  Ah, you don't need an RAR-15 or whatever they call it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=125.86s)]
*  So that's the head of the Democratic Party speaking very clearly the party's position [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=130.66s)]
*  on guns. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=134.86s)]
*  If we don't control them, you can't have them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=135.86s)]
*  Every Democrat thinks this is part of the catechism. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=139.04s)]
*  So you can imagine our surprise. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  The other day we're driving through Cambridge in the old hybrid Subaru, adjusting our surgical [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=143.12s)]
*  masks to cover both nose and mouth and listening, needless to say, to national public radio, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  the voice of menopausal liberalism. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=153.6s)]
*  And as we're listening, we hear this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=156.64s)]
*  We're going to play it for you and see if you can understand our total shock. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=158.28s)]
*  Mass shootings targeting LGBTQ spaces and a rise in anti-trans rhetoric have inspired [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=162.96s)]
*  some queer people to take up arms. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=169.08s)]
*  New Hampshire's public radio, Todd Bookman, joined a monthly gathering of a gun group [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=171.52s)]
*  that sees firearms as key to their own self-defense. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=175.68s)]
*  And as you might imagine, this story does include the sound of gunfire. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  On a recent Sunday morning, the parking lot of Patuckaway State Park in southeastern New [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=182.88s)]
*  Hampshire is filling up with hikers. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  There's also a different crew packing up warm clothes and weapons. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you all for coming to Rainbow Reload. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=192.38s)]
*  Your anti-trans rhetoric makes the trans community carry guns. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=197.38s)]
*  Rainbow Reload! [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=202.74s)]
*  They're packing heat. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=203.74s)]
*  There'll be appendix carrying in more ways than one. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=205.74s)]
*  Watch out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=208.18s)]
*  Wait a second, we thought. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=209.18s)]
*  This is NPR, national public radio, suddenly telling you that actually guns are good. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=211.3s)]
*  They're valuable tools of self-defense really against you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=218.94s)]
*  So there are times when guns are good, says NPR. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=224.26s)]
*  And we thought, wait a second, we've been listening to NPR since, well, click and clack [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  the Tappet Brothers. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=230.7s)]
*  And we remember very clearly their position on guns. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=232.24s)]
*  For example, quote, the U.S. has more guns than any other country in the world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=234.26s)]
*  This is the same NPR that, in between updates on the latest trans dinosaur emojis, we've [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=239.34s)]
*  very carefully, routinely run segments calling for more gun control and not subtle ones like [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=245.3s)]
*  the segment entitled, many gun owners support gun control. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=250.38000000000002s)]
*  So why don't they speak out? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=254.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, a lot of gun owners support gun control. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=255.66000000000003s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  And yet here's that same national public radio, state radio, state media, controlled by the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=260.72s)]
*  Biden administration, encouraging people to go to the gun store immediately. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=268.18s)]
*  Not all people, just trans people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=273.22s)]
*  Guns are bad, except in the hands of trans people. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=276.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=281.74s)]
*  Here's more. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=282.74s)]
*  Groups like Rainbow Reload exist around the country, often called pink pistol clubs. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=284.94s)]
*  It's a place for experts and the gun curious to practice and improve their shooting. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=289.48s)]
*  But this goes beyond hobby. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=293.98s)]
*  There's a practical goal here to prepare and protect themselves. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=295.56s)]
*  If the world is dangerous, then you have to be dangerous back. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=299.02s)]
*  And that very much has pushed me into where I am now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=303.02s)]
*  The gun curious. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=307.02s)]
*  Well you know when NPR describes something as the fill in the blank curious, then it's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  a good thing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=314.06s)]
*  The pedophile curious. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=316.18s)]
*  No, the gun curious. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=317.18s)]
*  The world is dangerous, you have to be dangerous back. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=318.7s)]
*  Now is that a quote from an FBI indictment of the Proud Boys? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=323.06s)]
*  No, it's from an NPR segment. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=325.98s)]
*  At this point, it's hard to tell the difference. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=329.14000000000004s)]
*  And the lip smacking NPR reporters just say it without any sense of self-awareness at [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  all. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=335.74s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=337.18s)]
*  Well you know what's going on here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=338.5s)]
*  Is that NPR has decided that guns are bad, except when the enforcers of its ideology [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=340.94s)]
*  have guns. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=347.22s)]
*  You can't have guns, but faithful servants of the Democratic Party can. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=348.22s)]
*  And that makes sense because like all totalitarians, they want a monopoly on force. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=352.3s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=359.3s)]
*  So debate ends at that point. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=360.7s)]
*  When one side has all the firearms, you don't have to argue. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=362.54s)]
*  You say well you can't change your sex. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=367.94s)]
*  Shut up bigot! [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=370.14s)]
*  Bang bang! [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=372.14s)]
*  What's interesting is this is not just one NPR segment. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=375.42s)]
*  The social justice reporter from NPR station KNKX in Seattle, a reporter called Lily Anna [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=378.02s)]
*  Fowler just reported on a fascinating story. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=385.14s)]
*  It's the suicide of a self-described trans person called Usy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=387.78s)]
*  In case you want to look it up, it's E-U-C-Y. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  Here's how that NPR reporter described the suicide of Usy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=395.46s)]
*  Quote, spoke to Rachel, a friend of Usy, the Ballard resident who died by suicide yesterday [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=399.62s)]
*  while being evicted by King County Sheriff's deputies. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=404.58s)]
*  Rachel says her friend had tried to get help in paying rent but exhausted all options. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=407.74s)]
*  Well that sounds awful. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=413.02s)]
*  So here's a person who's fallen on hard times like so many Americans is getting bounced [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=415.34000000000003s)]
*  out of her apartment and kills herself out of desperation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=419.3s)]
*  And anyone hearing or reading that dispatch from NPR reporter Lily Anna Fowler would feel [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=423.98s)]
*  pretty bad for the person who killed him or her self. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=430.3s)]
*  Politics aside completely. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=435.1s)]
*  But it turns out NPR didn't tell the entire story. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=437.22s)]
*  What NPR left out was that Usy had shot a sheriff's deputy prior to killing himself. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=440.42s)]
*  In fact, Usy put that sheriff's deputy in the hospital where he remains tonight after [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=446.72s)]
*  undergoing emergency surgery. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  That wasn't of any interest whatsoever to NPR social justice team. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=453.78000000000003s)]
*  They just didn't care. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=457.86s)]
*  What they wanted you to know was that Usy was part of the trans community and Usy died. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=458.86s)]
*  And so Usy's life matters much more than anyone's including the cop he shot and certainly [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=464.18s)]
*  more than yours. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  So what underlies all of this? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  It's not about trans rights. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=474.78000000000003s)]
*  Do you really think Joe Biden and his faithful vice president care about trans rights? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=475.78000000000003s)]
*  Not one bit. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=480.22s)]
*  About as much as they care about the daily suffering in Selma, Alabama. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=481.72s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=485.9s)]
*  Selma, Alabama is a desperate place. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=487.34000000000003s)]
*  Poverty and violence define it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=489.62s)]
*  But they show up once a year to relive the civil rights movement and then they leave. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=490.94s)]
*  That's how much they care. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=494.28s)]
*  And that's precisely how much they care about the trans community. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=495.28s)]
*  The trans community, of course, is a vehicle for something else and it's always the same [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=498.26s)]
*  thing which is political power. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=501.62s)]
*  And political power made possible by political violence. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=503.98s)]
*  They want to be able to commit it and they want you defenseless so you can't fight back. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=506.9s)]
*  A lot of people in this country want it, not just NPR listeners. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=512.46s)]
*  When police were holding a press conference about the shooting, again the shooting of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=515.6s)]
*  a police officer by a trans identifying individual called Usy, activists heckled the police [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=518.42s)]
*  spokeswoman as the cop was in the hospital undergoing emergency surgery. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=525.2199999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=530.6999999999999s)]
*  Because they said the spokeswoman misgendered the shooter. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=531.6999999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=535.66s)]
*  We've been led to believe that your 29 year old man is actually a transgender person. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=536.66s)]
*  Is there any truth to that? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=541.66s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=545.2199999999999s)]
*  I actually knew the person. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=546.62s)]
*  They are trans and I ask that they don't be dead named. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=548.4200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=552.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=554.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=555.22s)]
*  So obviously this country has reached peak frivolity. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=556.22s)]
*  The officer is in the hospital fighting for his life but the debate is whether we're dead [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=559.78s)]
*  naming someone who shot him. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=564.7s)]
*  So the people in that frame and a lot of people actually who listen to NPR care more about [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=568.6600000000001s)]
*  pronouns than human life. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=574.54s)]
*  NPR would rather you didn't know any of this. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  We only know that this actually happened because reporters like Jason Rantz and Andy Noh, one [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=579.5s)]
*  like NPR, don't take any money from taxpayers for paying attention and knew the details. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=582.98s)]
*  And by the way, Andy Noh has run the numbers about these claims of violence and genocide [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=587.5799999999999s)]
*  against the trans community and here's what he found having done actual research into [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=591.2199999999999s)]
*  a quote. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=595.8s)]
*  There is no genocide of trans people in the US or anywhere in the West. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=596.8s)]
*  In fact, there's been an explosion of trans identifying people, which research suggests [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=599.98s)]
*  is a social contagion spread by social media fads and youth peer pressure. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=604.62s)]
*  The few dozen trans people tragically killed in America each year are usually murdered [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=609.14s)]
*  by black men in the course of prostitution activities. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=613.1s)]
*  So we believe that that is factually true. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=617.1800000000001s)]
*  None of that ever gets mentioned, of course, least of all on national public radio. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=620.98s)]
*  What does get mentioned? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=624.38s)]
*  Well, the neo-Nazis, of course, they're the real threat. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=625.38s)]
*  After the ones targeting rainbow reload militia. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=628.22s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=631.58s)]
*  One of the members, Sharon, recently transitioned. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=632.58s)]
*  And I went from concealed carry every once in a while when I was sort of feeling it to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=635.4200000000001s)]
*  every single day because reading the news, having a few experiences, realizing that I've [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=642.58s)]
*  gone from old cis male white upper middle class really no real fears about anything [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=649.58s)]
*  to there are people that just looking at me will want to hurt me. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=658.94s)]
*  There's that individual fear, fear of what may happen simply existing in public. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=665.0600000000001s)]
*  But for some, there's also a more organized and ominous threat, including a neo-Nazi group [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=669.4000000000001s)]
*  now active in New England that's targeted trans people. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=673.74s)]
*  The neo-Nazi group active in New England, the least right wing region in America. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=678.28s)]
*  Every state is blue, but there's a neo-Nazi group that's terrifying everybody. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  Look, just to be clear, we're not against people, American citizens carrying firearms, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=688.6s)]
*  having firearms we support, including trans people. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=693.24s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=695.6s)]
*  But what you're watching here is not the exercise of the Second Amendment. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=696.9s)]
*  What you're watching here is political hysteria, fear, ginned up on purpose with maximum dishonesty [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=700.92s)]
*  in order to get people in a state of agitation, armed people in a state of agitation. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=708.76s)]
*  Doesn't matter if they're trans or not, whatever that is. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=713.24s)]
*  It's the same template always. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=717.24s)]
*  Scare the crap out of your voters, tell them that their lives are at risk, encourage them [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=720.52s)]
*  to get guns. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=725.88s)]
*  How do you think that ends? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=727.1s)]
*  But by the way, if we're following the logic here and why not, that's in short supply in [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=729.32s)]
*  this country, you have to kind of wonder like what's the limit to this? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=733.72s)]
*  So if trans people are in fear for their lives in every region of the country, including [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=737.86s)]
*  New England, which apparently is crawling with Nazis now, why wouldn't we be arming [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=742.74s)]
*  them as we are, say, Ukraine's trans army? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=747.58s)]
*  And there are famously trans people in Ukraine's army. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=751.6s)]
*  They're very, very proud of that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=753.9s)]
*  So why stop with AR-15s? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=755.86s)]
*  I mean, why not F-35s or tanks? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=758.1s)]
*  You know, that's a question for our highest ranking trans admiral, Richard Levine. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=763.54s)]
*  Here is Richard Levine in July of 2020 describing the threat. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=769.62s)]
*  The most vulnerable among us continue to suffer, including LGBTQ individuals of color, LGBTQ [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=775.0s)]
*  youth, LGBTQ seniors and LGBTQ immigrants. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=785.5s)]
*  So none of that is factually true, as we just told you. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=794.38s)]
*  In fact, some of the people he's describing are not the most oppressed in our society, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=797.86s)]
*  but literally and measurably the most entitled and privileged. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=801.14s)]
*  The Biden administration hired a kid to oversee nuclear waste disposal whose only qualification [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=806.3s)]
*  was his sexual fetishes. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=812.9s)]
*  So no, there's not genocide going on. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=814.34s)]
*  There's some weird affirmative action program going on. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=816.5400000000001s)]
*  But if you listen to NPR, you wouldn't know that. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=819.38s)]
*  And that kind of talk might scare the heck out of you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=823.14s)]
*  And if they encourage you to go get a gun and arm yourself because Nazis are taking [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=825.58s)]
*  over Vermont, you might do it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=828.7800000000001s)]
*  Again, words for guns as you could possibly be. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=831.86s)]
*  But this seems like an incitement. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfH9kXkors&t=835.3000000000001s)]
