# Former student who was ‘deprogrammed’ after college slams woke education
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs)
*  So a lot of parents have had this experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=0.0s)]
*  You send your kid off to college, you're proud. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  Dylan got into Duke, we're so happy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=4.2s)]
*  And then the kid comes back and hates not only you, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=6.58s)]
*  but the country and himself, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=9.16s)]
*  and the chances of that child [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=11.56s)]
*  having a happy, productive personal life go to about zero. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=12.88s)]
*  That's the fruit of liberal arts in this country now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=15.56s)]
*  So it's a very common experience, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=19.28s)]
*  but one mother decided to try and fix it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=21.84s)]
*  She sent her daughter to attend Mount Holyoke [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=24.12s)]
*  University of Massachusetts, tuition over 50K a year. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  The child comes back, totally programmed, like a cult member. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=31.0s)]
*  So the mom spends 300 bucks a day for a deprogrammer [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=34.64s)]
*  to undo the brainwashing, and it worked. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=38.16s)]
*  Annabelle Rockwell is the daughter. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  She graduated Mount Holyoke. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  She's now the development director at PragerU. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  She joins us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Annabelle, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=47.08s)]
*  So deprogram suggests undoing unreasonable religious belief. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  Did you feel like a cult member after Mount Holyoke? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=55.92s)]
*  Tucker, thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=61.0s)]
*  First, I'm gonna say that I arrived at Mount Holyoke, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=63.36s)]
*  bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=66.2s)]
*  so excited to be there in 2011. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=67.6s)]
*  And as soon as I got there, I was told that, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=70.0s)]
*  I should refer to myself as a first year, not a freshman, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=73.04s)]
*  because we were at historically women's college. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=75.6s)]
*  I was left a note in my mailbox saying, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=77.88s)]
*  he may be a she, she may be a he, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=81.36s)]
*  don't assume anyone's gender. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=83.36s)]
*  And I thought, oh, okay, like that's new. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=85.26s)]
*  And then the last thing was we had the moho chop, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  which was this ritualistic haircut that people did [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=90.34s)]
*  in the first semester where everyone would [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=93.86s)]
*  shave their head, sort of as an act of rebellion. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=95.7s)]
*  So to answer your question, yes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=99.54s)]
*  I mean, as time went on and I studied history, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  I became completely brainwashed into believing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=104.34s)]
*  that I was oppressed by our toxic patriarchal society. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=106.78s)]
*  And I left school, I was sad, anxious, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=110.7s)]
*  intellectually starving. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=113.9s)]
*  And by 2015, when I graduated, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=115.38s)]
*  I completely estranged myself from my family. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=117.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, that is underneath it all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=121.7s)]
*  We joke about the Lunacy and college campuses, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=123.78s)]
*  but the real cost is not that they'll vote Democrat. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=126.74s)]
*  The real cost is that they won't [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=128.78s)]
*  love their parents anymore. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=131.02s)]
*  And that's the most upsetting part of it, I think. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=132.46s)]
*  So how did you get better? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=135.18s)]
*  So in this panic of me not communicating with my mother, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=138.5s)]
*  she consulted a cult specialist. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=141.54s)]
*  This person gave her devastating statistics [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=144.78s)]
*  that most people don't make it out, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=147.02s)]
*  but a glimmer of hope that it tends [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=148.5s)]
*  to be young women who do. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=150.34s)]
*  So she spoke to him and he made it very clear to her, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=152.46s)]
*  do not affirm your daughter's newfound identity. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=155.66s)]
*  You know her best, she is your child, don't affirm her. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=158.5s)]
*  So she was taught how to communicate with me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=162.26s)]
*  Now, to actually be deprogrammed, I had to humble myself. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=166.02s)]
*  Couple things, I reconnected with my family. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=170.58s)]
*  I moved home, I asked for forgiveness, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=173.5s)]
*  I admitted I was wrong. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=176.18s)]
*  Secondly, I made a lifestyle change. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=177.62s)]
*  I stopped drinking, I started to believe in God again. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=179.54000000000002s)]
*  And lastly, I had to unlearn my four years of wokeism [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=182.5s)]
*  by watching five-minute PragerU videos online for free. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=187.06s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  It is a cult, its aim is to separate you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=194.3s)]
*  from the people who love you most, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=197.22000000000003s)]
*  and I just, I'm so impressed and have such respect [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=198.86s)]
*  for your mother for taking it as seriously [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=202.78s)]
*  as it deserves to be taken in for you for getting out of it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=204.22000000000003s)]
*  Annabelle Rockwell of PragerU, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=206.38000000000002s)]
*  thank you so much for coming on. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=208.02s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQWOgKwmxs&t=210.78s)]
