# Matt Walsh: 'We have to keep shining a light' on gender transition surgeries for children
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs)
*  Matt Walsh joins us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=0.0s)]
*  Matt Walsh, thank you so much. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=1.44s)]
*  And among other things, illustrating how journalism [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=4.0s)]
*  can be a force for good, I think yours has been. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=7.36s)]
*  Have you spoken to anyone at Vanderbilt Hospital [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=11.36s)]
*  about this directly? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=14.68s)]
*  Well, Vanderbilt Hospital, I mean, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=17.14s)]
*  we reached out for a statement when [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=18.52s)]
*  we first published the report. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=20.32s)]
*  And at first, they didn't want to give a statement. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=21.64s)]
*  And they actually just took down, as you mentioned, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=23.0s)]
*  they just deleted. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=25.2s)]
*  That's what people have to understand. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=26.12s)]
*  They deleted their entire transgender clinic website. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=27.16s)]
*  They wiped it from existence. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=29.84s)]
*  And then today, not to us, but in general, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=31.6s)]
*  they released a statement. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=34.04s)]
*  And the interesting thing about the statement they released [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=35.28s)]
*  is that they do not, while they start by claiming there's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=36.8s)]
*  misinformation and so on, they don't actually factually [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=39.44s)]
*  dispute anything in my report because they can't, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=42.68s)]
*  because everything that I said wasn't me saying it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=46.04s)]
*  I was just providing video evidence, much of which [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=48.72s)]
*  you played there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  What we know for a fact, this is an absolute fact, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  that Vanderbilt, they perform double mastectomies [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  on minor girls, on children. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=59.04s)]
*  They chemically castrate children. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=61.24s)]
*  And they give them irreversible hormone drugs [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=63.2s)]
*  that change their bodies permanently. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=66.28s)]
*  They're doing all of that to kids. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=68.08s)]
*  And the other thing we should note, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=69.88s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned all the other hospitals [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=71.08s)]
*  around the country, because the things I just mentioned, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=72.6s)]
*  that's happening all across the country in every single state, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=75.6s)]
*  in many hospitals and in many other medical clinics. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=79.72s)]
*  All of those things are happening. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=82.68s)]
*  And one of the reasons why it's allowed to keep happening [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=84.24s)]
*  is because people don't know about it, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=86.8s)]
*  because they're not talking about it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=88.74s)]
*  And I think for a lot of average Americans, people just walking [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=90.3s)]
*  down the street, it's sort of unthinkable. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  They can't imagine that this sort of thing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  is actually happening. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  But it is, which is why we have to start [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=99.66s)]
*  by raising awareness about it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=101.78s)]
*  And we have to do that no matter the game the left plays, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=103.41999999999999s)]
*  by saying, if you so much as mention what they're doing, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=107.66s)]
*  it's incitement and terrorism, which is absurd. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  But we can't bend to that tactic. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=115.66s)]
*  We have to keep shining a light on this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=117.7s)]
*  Cutting the breasts off little girls? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=119.7s)]
*  Sterilizing 14-year-olds? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=122.5s)]
*  Like, yeah, OK. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=124.38s)]
*  Yeah, we're not the criminals here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=125.54s)]
*  And by the way, I've got to believe [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=126.94s)]
*  that not everyone on the board at Vanderbilt Medical Center [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=128.5s)]
*  is a bad person. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=130.74s)]
*  I've got to believe a lot of these people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=131.58s)]
*  had no idea this was happening. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=132.62s)]
*  And I hope they know now, and I hope they do something tonight [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=134.26s)]
*  to end it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=137.22s)]
*  I appreciate your coming on. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=137.9s)]
*  And for all you've done on this, Matt Walsh, thank you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbflqvwdyfs&t=139.42000000000002s)]
