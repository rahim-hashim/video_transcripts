# ‘Libs of Tik Tok’ creator speaks on Big Tech punishments
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo)
*  So obviously Twitter doesn't exist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=0.0s)]
*  so we can share opinions with one another. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=2.54s)]
*  It exists to silence anyone who challenges [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=5.88s)]
*  the Biden administration and the oligarchs [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=9.32s)]
*  in Silicon Valley who support the Biden administration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=11.24s)]
*  And to that end, they've censored the former president, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=15.76s)]
*  the New York Post, Charlie Kirk, the Babylon Bee, this show. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=18.3s)]
*  Last night, Twitter suspended a very popular account [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=20.92s)]
*  called Libs of TikTok. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Now, Libs of TikTok is essentially an account [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=25.16s)]
*  that finds video of liberals talking about themselves [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=28.82s)]
*  and their own beliefs and posts it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=31.5s)]
*  It was of course targeted because once you see [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=34.46s)]
*  what these people are saying, they discredit themselves [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=37.78s)]
*  and horrify normal people. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=41.14s)]
*  Here's some of the footage Libs of TikTok has unearned. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=42.34s)]
*  I wanna talk to the kids. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=44.74s)]
*  Sometimes human beings are more than boy or girl. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=46.54s)]
*  Sometimes we're something else. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  Sometimes we're both. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=51.78s)]
*  Sometimes we kind of float in between. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=53.54s)]
*  Mostly I feel feminine or non-binary. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=57.5s)]
*  Today I'm feeling really femme and cat-like as well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=60.9s)]
*  I don't have to hide or lie or be embarrassed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=66.06s)]
*  about a natural function my body does. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=68.42s)]
*  So all that to say, I am on my period. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  You heard me, having a period for the first time [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=73.5s)]
*  in six years and not just any period, the period from hell. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=75.58s)]
*  I identify as a threat, a nightmare and a goddess. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=79.84s)]
*  So please bow down to me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=82.82s)]
*  I do not believe in God. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=84.7s)]
*  I don't worship the devil. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=85.9s)]
*  But yes, I am a Satanist, which means I am my own God [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=87.02s)]
*  and I worship myself. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=89.74s)]
*  So for the crime of letting liberals talk about themselves [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=92.02s)]
*  and showing people what they actually think, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  Media Matters did a hit piece on Libs of TikTok, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  described it as hate, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=101.22s)]
*  and Twitter dutifully pulled it off the platform. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  That's exactly how that system works. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=106.14s)]
*  So the creator of Libs of TikTok remains anonymous. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=108.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=111.82s)]
*  Because we live in a country where you can't even say [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=112.66s)]
*  what you think without threats of violence against you, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=114.74s)]
*  if you're not on the left. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=118.1s)]
*  But we are happy to talk to that person over the phone, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  which we are doing now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=123.06s)]
*  The creator of Libs of TikTok joins us on the line. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=124.06s)]
*  Don't know your name, glad you're on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=128.46s)]
*  So you were pulled off Twitter [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=131.42s)]
*  after you were attacked by Media Matters [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=135.14s)]
*  for disseminating hate. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=137.62s)]
*  Were you surprised by this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=139.45999999999998s)]
*  Exactly, no, I was not surprised at all. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=142.12s)]
*  It definitely felt like a very organized attack [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=144.94s)]
*  by the left to get me suspended. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=146.78s)]
*  So how big, and this is not the first platform [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=151.58s)]
*  from which you've been suspended [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=154.3s)]
*  for holding up liberals in their own voice [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=155.7s)]
*  to the rest of the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=159.38s)]
*  Where else have you been kicked off? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=160.5s)]
*  I have been kicked off of TikTok [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=163.22s)]
*  and I've gotten multiple violations on Instagram. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=165.22s)]
*  It's just remarkable to me in a country like ours [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=168.94s)]
*  that you feel the need to remain anonymous. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=171.94s)]
*  Tell us why you're not giving us your name tonight. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=174.26s)]
*  Well, I've gotten a few death threats. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=177.7s)]
*  I got a ton of hate mail [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=180.74s)]
*  and the left has been showing recently [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=182.74s)]
*  how they would treat people who disagreed with them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=186.74s)]
*  It's funny because there is some of the death threats. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=191.26s)]
*  I mean, I've reported to the police [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=193.54s)]
*  and they still have their accounts on Twitter. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=196.14s)]
*  So you can threaten violence and still keep your account [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=197.94s)]
*  but you can't play a video [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=200.94s)]
*  of what a leftist is themselves saying. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=202.54s)]
*  Right, so your opinions are violence, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=207.5s)]
*  their violence are protected speech. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=210.74s)]
*  You see how that works. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=212.94s)]
*  Thank you so much for your bravery. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=215.9s)]
*  And again, I just can't overstate, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=219.18s)]
*  you're not even giving us your name tonight. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  And again, I just can't overstate, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=223.22s)]
*  you're not even giving your opinions necessarily, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=225.38s)]
*  just holding up their opinions for the country to see [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=227.38s)]
*  and for revealing them in their natural habitat, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  you're on the run. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  Creator of Libs of TikTok, whatever your name is, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=235.34s)]
*  thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=237.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbG6lIpa8jo&t=239.22s)]
