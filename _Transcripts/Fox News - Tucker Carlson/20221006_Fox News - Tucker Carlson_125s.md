# Tucker Carlson: This can be jarring
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight Kanye West now known as yay is one of the best-selling musical artists in the world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=0.0s)]
*  He is also in recent years becoming celebrated and very highly paid fashion designer [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=7.68s)]
*  And of course for a decade he was well known to TV audiences as an in-law of the Kardashian family [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=11.52s)]
*  But it's West's latest incarnation as a kind of Christian evangelist that brought us to his office in Los Angeles today for the interview [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=16.84s)]
*  You're about to see [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=23.76s)]
*  Days ago during Fashion Week in Paris West accompanied by his friend Candice Owens [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=25.32s)]
*  Unveiled a t-shirt that read simply white lives matter [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=30.72s)]
*  The response from the fashion industry and international media was instantaneous and uniform shock horror rage [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=34.38s)]
*  There is no excuse for this thundered the New York Times West is legitimizing extremism shrieked Rolling Stone [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=42.0s)]
*  Etc etc [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=49.08s)]
*  What was strikingly missing from the coverage however was any explanation for why West did this what was the t-shirt about? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=50.56s)]
*  No one seemed to think to ask him much less to listen to what he had to say [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=57.42s)]
*  Instead the enemies of his ideas dismissed West as they have for years as mentally ill [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  Too crazy to take seriously look away ignore him. He's a mental patient. There's nothing to see here [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=67.16s)]
*  But is West crazy? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=73.44s)]
*  You can judge for yourself as you watch what we're about to show you he has his own ideas [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=75.88s)]
*  We can say that creative people tend to that's why they're artists not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  Actuaries his free-form social media posts give the impression of a man channeling his rawest emotions right onto Instagram [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=84.56s)]
*  The effect can be jarring and it's often used as ammunition [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Against him in the battle for influence over the minds of America's young people and that battle is intense [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=95.12s)]
*  But crazy [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  That was not our conclusion in fact [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=103.0s)]
*  We've rarely heard a man speak so honestly and so movingly about what he believes [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=105.56s)]
*  But again you can judge for yourself here [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awide14nvP8&t=111.08s)]
