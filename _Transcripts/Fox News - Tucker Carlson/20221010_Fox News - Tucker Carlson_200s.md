# Pro-life father details jarring arrest in front of children
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0)
*  Paul Vaughn, who was arrested in front of his many children, joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=0.0s)]
*  He's joined by his attorney, Peter Breen, who's a senior counsel and VP at the Thomas [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=4.92s)]
*  Moore Society. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=8.2s)]
*  Thank you both very much. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Paul, first to you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  I have to wonder, what did your children think of this? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=12.48s)]
*  Well, Tucker, there's various thoughts and processing going on as they're dealing with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=17.84s)]
*  trying to work through what happened. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=28.0s)]
*  Fortunately, as a Christian family, we do a lot of studying about historic Christianity [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=30.0s)]
*  and missionaries in the past and persecution that has happened in the church. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=34.6s)]
*  So they're familiar with stories. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=38.56s)]
*  They know there are people who have been martyred throughout history. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  They know they've been persecuted and picked on by bully tyrants just in other parts of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=42.76s)]
*  history just like they are being in America today. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  You're not allowed to unleash the FBI on an entire religion, are you? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=52.24s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=59.24s)]
*  And don't think because they've been trained that makes it OK. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=60.24s)]
*  When my kids go out to the car to go to school and the FBI pulls up armed, running to the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=64.04s)]
*  door and one of them goes to the kids and holds the kids with a long gun, the side of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  my driveway does not let them go into the house. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  That is absolutely, as my wife said in the video, unacceptable and there needs to be [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=80.76s)]
*  accountability. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=85.84s)]
*  Well, it's one of the most shocking things I think I've ever seen. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=86.84s)]
*  I have to ask you, so the FBI, the Department of Justice, I can barely say that phrase with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=89.84s)]
*  a straight face, is claiming that you're a violent extremist who is a physical threat [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  to others. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=99.68s)]
*  Do you embrace violence? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=100.68s)]
*  Have you ever committed violence? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=101.68s)]
*  What are they talking about? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=103.4s)]
*  No, I have no idea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=104.4s)]
*  There's absolutely no evidence of that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=110.16s)]
*  The only place that is ever even seen is in the documents that they made up and used to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=111.16s)]
*  justify in their mind and through the justice system, the ones that signed off on this needed [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=116.56s)]
*  some kind of justification in their own minds to go after peaceful people that disagreed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=122.6s)]
*  with them politically. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=128.22s)]
*  Peter Breen, thank you for working on this case for defending Paul Vaughan. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=130.22s)]
*  Do you think that this is actually going to go to trial? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=135.8s)]
*  Well, Tucker, when you've got a federal prosecutor after you, we always have to plan for that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=139.4s)]
*  Paul wasn't even arrested by the local police for trespassing, but those who did, who were [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  arrested, were leaning on the tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=151.68s)]
*  He himself was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  This is the great tradition of American civil disobedience and it's not the sort of thing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  that you turn into a 10-year felony. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=163.88s)]
*  Paul himself, we believe we have very strong defenses and hope to beat these charges at trial. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  And I hope you do so with a country that rises up on your side because this is, he wasn't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=172.56s)]
*  even arrested for trespassing at the scene and over a year later they send the FBI to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=176.88s)]
*  his house in front of his children. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  It's really just beyond. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  I appreciate both of you coming on tonight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CNAR8hY7r0&t=186.48000000000002s)]
