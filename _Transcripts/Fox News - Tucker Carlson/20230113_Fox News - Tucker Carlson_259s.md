# Tucker goes one-on-one with commentator who wore giant prosthetic breasts to make a point
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM)
*  You Dallas remember the Canadian shop teacher who decided to pull the kids in his class [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=0.0s)]
*  into his weird sexual fetishes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=4.68s)]
*  The teacher goes by the name of Kayla Lemieux, showed up in enormous fake prosthetic breasts [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  and wagged them at the kids. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=12.46s)]
*  And for months, the cowardly school board in Ontario, that would be the Halton District [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=13.68s)]
*  School Board, defended this creep. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=17.7s)]
*  But now, under pressure, including the threat of legal action from parents, they appear [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=20.32s)]
*  to be backing down a little bit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=24.12s)]
*  The school board says it will require a professional dress code from teachers, meaning smaller [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=25.94s)]
*  prosthetic breasts, apparently. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=31.66s)]
*  Well, the Canadian media ignored this story. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  Rebel News did not. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=36.5s)]
*  Its reporter David Menzies has been on it from the very beginning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=37.78s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=40.18s)]
*  David, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=41.5s)]
*  You look great, by the way. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  Well, you know Tucker on Network TV, as they say, as they say, give them the jiggle with [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  the giggle, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=53.38s)]
*  That is 100%. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=55.6s)]
*  Look, as long as you feel empowered, we're for it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=56.6s)]
*  Tell us, like, how, since you are wearing the costume of the shop teacher in Ontario, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, how, could you teach shop class wearing those things, I guess, just to core competency [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=65.72s)]
*  first? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=73.64s)]
*  Oh, Tucker, you could not. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=74.64s)]
*  In fact, I've always said, forget about the Ministry of Education. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  Where's the Ministry of Labor? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=79.64s)]
*  Long sleeves, long hair, not done up in a bun or a hairnet, jewelry. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=81.68s)]
*  Busty Lemieux breaks every shop etiquette rule in the book. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, just in case your audience thinks I've attached myself to some kind of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=89.72000000000001s)]
*  fetish lifestyle or I'm a drag queen storyteller for hire, no, that's not the case. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=96.28s)]
*  I went there to the Halton District School Board back in October, dressed exactly like [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  Busty Lemieux, the sheer blouse with the nipples protruding, the blonde hair, the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=109.04s)]
*  bicycle shorts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  And here's the thing about the hypocrisy of the Halton District School Board, Tucker. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=116.28s)]
*  They're all down with the radical transgender agenda, but only when it's in front of the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=121.02000000000001s)]
*  kids, when it's in front of their school board meeting, they actually fled the room. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=127.12s)]
*  And I have subsequently been banned for life, for life, Tucker, from Halton District School [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=134.5s)]
*  Board headquarters and all their schools because I guess I was asking impolite questions and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=139.98s)]
*  they don't like the idea of drag when it comes to them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=146.4s)]
*  Now, the news, Tucker, is that earlier this month, the HDSB trustees approved a request [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=150.26s)]
*  to the education director. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=157.34s)]
*  His name is Curtis Innis He-Him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=159.34s)]
*  And what they want to do is craft a professionalism policy to maintain appropriate and professional [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  standards of dress in the classroom. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=169.8s)]
*  Now, maybe you and your viewers are saying, wait a minute, isn't this deja vu all over [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  again? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Didn't they look into this back in November? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  And yes, they did. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  And it was rejected in November by Sara Saritaha, who is their human resources superintendent. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=182.4s)]
*  So two things here, Tucker. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  What would change from November until March? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=196.28s)]
*  I don't think anything has. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=200.0s)]
*  And also that director of education, Curtis Innis He-Him, he released a statement where [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=201.96s)]
*  he essentially said that he might veto a dress code recommendation that they will continue [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=209.2s)]
*  to be answerable to human rights, equity, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  So the HDSB is kind of like professional wrestling. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=224.83999999999997s)]
*  Nothing is real until it happens. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=228.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't know what's going on up there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=231.0s)]
*  We're going to have to visit your country sometime soon as to check it out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=232.0s)]
*  And I have to say, I'm a little bit sympathetic to the school board because I am intimidated [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  by your prosthetic breasts and may need to flee. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=238.6s)]
*  But I appreciate it coming on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=241.68s)]
*  Anyway, David Menzies, thank you of Rebel News. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=242.68s)]
*  My pleasure, Tucker. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=245.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epdtOywAEM&t=246.6s)]
