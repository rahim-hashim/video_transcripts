# Tucker: Why did they let Kenosha burn?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight is just another evening and what has become a pretty high drama country, really. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=6.2s)]
*  The jury in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial has gone home for the night after many hours of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=10.56s)]
*  deliberations today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=14.88s)]
*  The average jury reaches a verdict in just a few hours, so these jurors are taking much [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=16.4s)]
*  longer than most. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=20.12s)]
*  But it's probably not because the evidence they have heard is confusing them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=21.64s)]
*  In a typical trial, an insider trading trial, for example, something complex, an honest [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=27.08s)]
*  observer might be able to see both sides of the case and probably can. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  But that is not true here, far from it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  In fact, it's the opposite. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=37.76s)]
*  From the very first moments of this trial, it was obvious that Kyle Rittenhouse never [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=38.76s)]
*  should have been indicted in the first place. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=42.72s)]
*  The key question was, did Kyle Rittenhouse act in self-defense that night in Kenosha? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=45.12s)]
*  And the answer, unequivocally, is yes, obviously. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=50.959999999999994s)]
*  It's a no-brainer. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=53.2s)]
*  It's like the OJ trial. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=54.2s)]
*  So, an honest person could reach a different conclusion. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=55.2s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse shot men he believed were trying to kill him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=58.28s)]
*  Now, why did Kyle Rittenhouse believe that, you may ask? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  Well, in one case, the man he shot told him so directly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  I plan to kill you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=67.72s)]
*  Of the other two men Kyle Rittenhouse shot, one repeatedly bashed him in the head with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=69.76s)]
*  a skateboard as he lay on the ground, and the other stuck a loaded gun in his face. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=73.64s)]
*  So Kyle Rittenhouse fought back in order to save his own life. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm not guessing about that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Even the prosecution's witnesses made that point. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=83.76s)]
*  So once that happened, once Kyle Rittenhouse's life was threatened on the street in Kenosha, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=86.78s)]
*  what were his options exactly? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, he could fight back, or he could allow himself to be murdered by the rioters. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=93.72s)]
*  And allowing himself to be murdered by the rioters is essentially what the prosecution [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  has argued he should have done. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=101.56s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse had a duty to submit to the mob. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's lunacy, and no sane jury could agree with that for a second. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  So the question is, why is it taking so long for this jury to produce a very obvious verdict? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=111.32s)]
*  Want the answer? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=118.52s)]
*  Well, look outside the courtroom. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=119.52s)]
*  There are hundreds of National Guard troops assembled tonight in Kenosha. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  Why are they there? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=124.6s)]
*  Well, they've come in case Kyle Rittenhouse is acquitted. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=125.6s)]
*  Not in case he's convicted, in case he's acquitted, at which point, if he is acquitted, pretty [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=128.76s)]
*  much everyone expects the usual mobs of Joe Biden voters to burn and loot and destroy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=133.06s)]
*  Why does everyone expect this? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=138.64s)]
*  Because people on the left are openly calling for it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=139.92s)]
*  Quote, now that jury deliberation has begun, I think every city in America should prepare [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=143.2s)]
*  for what could happen if Rittenhouse gets acquitted. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  It may get rightfully unpleasant. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  That's the message from a teacher. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=155.0s)]
*  We checked an actual teacher from the state of Indiana, wrote it on Twitter today, and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  it echoes what many others are saying tonight. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  So imagine if you were a juror in this case. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  How would you feel about this? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=165.44s)]
*  You're not sequestered. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=166.44s)]
*  You know how the country feels. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=167.44s)]
*  You know what the threats are. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=168.52s)]
*  Well, you might think twice before you acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse, no matter what the evidence [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=169.52s)]
*  was. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=174.28s)]
*  You remember what happened after Rodney King. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=175.28s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=177.72s)]
*  They burned Los Angeles to the ground. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=178.72s)]
*  You wouldn't want to be responsible for that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=180.32s)]
*  You wouldn't want to spark riots. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=181.68s)]
*  And of course, that's the whole point of the exercise. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=184.16s)]
*  The mob threatens violence. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=187.4s)]
*  The rest of us tremble. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=189.4s)]
*  And pretty soon, the mob controls our justice system. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=191.36s)]
*  Pretty soon, the enemies of civilization, which is what they are, are in charge of the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=194.92s)]
*  country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=199.28s)]
*  That's what's happening now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=200.28s)]
*  So it's worth pausing for a moment to ask, how do we get here exactly? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=202.48s)]
*  Well, here's one summary that caught our eye. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=205.32s)]
*  Today, a Hill staffer called Billy Gribben summed it up in the following way. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=207.2s)]
*  Quote, we're waiting to see if riots break out because of media lies about a case from [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=210.76s)]
*  a riot that happened because of media lies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's nicely put, and it's totally true. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=218.76s)]
*  The August 2020 riot in Kenosha wasn't really a riot in the way that we understand riots. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=223.22s)]
*  It was an outbreak of political violence. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=228.1s)]
*  It began three days after the Democratic convention. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=230.7s)]
*  That was the context for it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=232.82s)]
*  It was, in fact, one of many riots that summer across the country, all of which were explicitly [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=234.54s)]
*  supported by the leadership of the Democratic Party. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=239.16s)]
*  We're not making this up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=241.78s)]
*  Look it up. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=242.78s)]
*  What was the point of these riots? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=243.78s)]
*  Well, of course, big picture. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=244.94s)]
*  The point was to unseat Donald Trump. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=246.22s)]
*  In the specific case of Kenosha, we know exactly the chain of events that led to where we are [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=249.16s)]
*  A man called Jacob Blake was shot by the police. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=253.54s)]
*  Immediately, the media and the Democratic politicians they served lied about what happened. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=256.62s)]
*  So they told us that a cop shot Jacob Blake in the back for no apparent reason. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=262.06s)]
*  And by the way, Jacob Blake was unarmed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=266.38s)]
*  He was helpless. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=268.42s)]
*  They just pulled him out of a lineup and shot him because that's what America is like. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=269.42s)]
*  Kamala Harris then jumped in and said she was, quote, proud of Jacob Blake, like he [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  was a civil rights hero, like he was shot for being the wrong color, as so often happens [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=276.8s)]
*  in the systemically racist country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=281.74s)]
*  But it was all totally untrue, not just the themes, but the facts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  They were lies. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=287.74s)]
*  In fact, the police were responding to a call from a woman who said Jacob Blake was trying [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=289.62s)]
*  to kidnap her child. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=293.42s)]
*  So the police showed up as they should have. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=295.62s)]
*  They tried to detain Jacob Blake and Jacob Blake fought the cops. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=297.66s)]
*  Then he grabbed a knife. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=300.70000000000005s)]
*  Jacob Blake was holding that knife when he was shot by the police. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=302.1s)]
*  Jacob Blake admitted that on television. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=305.5s)]
*  But it was too late. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=308.86s)]
*  Based on the first false stories from the news media told intentionally, our leaders [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=310.54s)]
*  suggested that these riots in Kenosha were somehow justified and then allowed them to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=315.58000000000004s)]
*  continue. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=319.42s)]
*  So this is what Kenosha looked like the night that Kyle Rittenhouse arrived to help defend [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=321.48s)]
*  local businesses. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=325.38s)]
*  Well, that's not a civil rights protest. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=371.38s)]
*  That's not people fighting back against oppression, systemic racism. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=373.74s)]
*  That's just people destroying things they didn't build. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=378.66s)]
*  That's people wrecking our civilization. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=381.32s)]
*  In no normal country would that be allowed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=383.1s)]
*  It would be put down immediately with force. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=384.82000000000005s)]
*  That's why we have police. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  You can't allow that because if you do allow that, people get killed, as they did. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=388.66s)]
*  But local police, you should know, did virtually nothing to stop any of the things you just [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=393.90000000000003s)]
*  saw. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=397.06s)]
*  At the very top of the power structure, the state of Wisconsin, the word was, let it happen. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=398.06s)]
*  The governor of Wisconsin, Tony Evers, in fact, turned down an offer from Washington [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=402.98s)]
*  to send federal officers in order to help get Kenosha under control, to save the city. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=407.3s)]
*  That was a shockingly irresponsible decision. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=412.02s)]
*  It was an immoral decision. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=414.22s)]
*  But Tony Evers still defends it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=416.38s)]
*  I have no regrets, he says. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=417.58s)]
*  Really. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=418.94s)]
*  That's because he doesn't live in Kenosha. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=419.94s)]
*  Downtown Kenosha burned. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=420.94s)]
*  It will never be rebuilt. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=422.42s)]
*  Talk about a city that doesn't deserve any of this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=423.42s)]
*  Kenosha is a town of just 100,000 people. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=426.5s)]
*  Many of them, by the way, are Hispanic, if that even matters. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=428.46s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=430.7s)]
*  They're not rich people who live there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=431.7s)]
*  Kenosha is far past its prime. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=433.26s)]
*  It was part of the industrial base that built this country, that built the modern world. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=434.9s)]
*  Now it's suffering even more than it was before the riots because a bunch of entitled antisocial [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=438.7s)]
*  lunatics broke things for no reason because our leaders allowed them. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=443.14s)]
*  A city official estimates the damage from last summer's riots, about $50 million. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=448.58s)]
*  That's a lot in Kenosha. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=453.06s)]
*  In fact, it's more than half the entire municipal budget for the city of Kenosha. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=454.46s)]
*  So why did the people in charge allow Kenosha to be destroyed? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=459.02s)]
*  This happened over days. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=461.98s)]
*  They allowed this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=463.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=464.62s)]
*  Well, for the same reason they indicted Kyle Rittenhouse, to send a very clear message [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=465.62s)]
*  to the rest of us watching on television. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=468.86s)]
*  Don't resist. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=471.06s)]
*  When the mob comes, you can't fight back. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=472.06s)]
*  We're in charge. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=474.22s)]
*  We'll do what we want. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=475.22s)]
*  All summer they sent that message to the rest of us. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=476.5s)]
*  All summer they made that very clear. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=478.86s)]
*  Here's what happened to one man who foolishly tried to defend his own business from looters [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=481.1s)]
*  in Dallas. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=485.3s)]
*  There's so much video like that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=486.3s)]
*  And at the time we restrained ourselves and didn't show all of it, we're not going to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=512.34s)]
*  show all of it tonight because it's too divisive. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=515.38s)]
*  It's too awful. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=518.5400000000001s)]
*  It hypes people up too much. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=519.5400000000001s)]
*  It's too emotional. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=520.9s)]
*  But it's totally real. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=522.1800000000001s)]
*  That happened across the country to people who did nothing wrong. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=523.3000000000001s)]
*  So the message over time was very, very clear. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=527.58s)]
*  And again, it's the same message they're sending us with the Rittenhouse trial. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=530.7s)]
*  Resistance is futile. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=533.98s)]
*  Try to defend yourself and we're going to throw you in jail. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=535.1800000000001s)]
*  During closing arguments, in case you missed the point, one of the prosecutors in this [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=537.86s)]
*  case said it out loud. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=541.14s)]
*  When the mob comes, he said, just let them beat you. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=542.9s)]
*  Everybody takes a beating sometimes, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=546.54s)]
*  Sometimes you get in a scuffle and maybe you do get hurt a little bit. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=548.86s)]
*  That doesn't mean you get to start plugging people with your full metal jacket, AR-15 [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=554.18s)]
*  rounds and no bullets are not bullets. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=558.54s)]
*  Everyone takes a beating sometimes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=562.62s)]
*  You've taken a beating, Tubby? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=563.62s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=564.62s)]
*  How dare you talk like that in court? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=565.62s)]
*  In a sane, civilized society, you can't condone violence just because the people committing [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=568.54s)]
*  it vote for the candidate you like. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=572.9s)]
*  You can't. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=574.5s)]
*  Notice the change here, though. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=575.5s)]
*  This case has gone from white supremacists hunt down and execute BLM protesters, right, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=577.02s)]
*  like it was a racial case, everyone's white, to the new theme, which is that teenager should [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=582.06s)]
*  have accepted his beating from the child molester arsonist who was chasing him and threatened [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=586.26s)]
*  to kill him. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=589.74s)]
*  And because he didn't, he needs to go to jail. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=590.74s)]
*  Once again, very clear message. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=593.5s)]
*  Submit. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=595.26s)]
*  The prosecution hammered this again and again and again. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=596.26s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=598.9s)]
*  Why do you get to immediately just start shooting? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=599.9s)]
*  As Mr. Binger said, he brought a gun to a fist fight. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=603.62s)]
*  He was too cowardly to use his own fist to fight his way out. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=607.54s)]
*  He has to start shooting. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=612.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=615.42s)]
*  Too cowardly? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=617.62s)]
*  A 17-year-old should have gotten in a fist fight with a 36-year-old violent pedophile? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=618.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=624.38s)]
*  Speaking of cowardly, where were the police who were paid to stop this stuff, who were [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=625.86s)]
*  paid to keep mob violence from happening in the first place? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=629.74s)]
*  Where's the governor, who was under too much political pressure to protect his own people? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=632.3s)]
*  Talk about cowardly. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=636.5s)]
*  Blaming a 17-year-old who shows up because the city his dad lives in is on fire and he [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=638.1s)]
*  wants to do something? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=642.58s)]
*  He shouldn't have been there in the first place. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=644.34s)]
*  He shouldn't have had to have been there. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=645.74s)]
*  The adults should have been there. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=648.38s)]
*  They're the cowards. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=649.74s)]
*  These prosecutors are appalling. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=652.14s)]
*  This whole spectacle is appalling. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=653.5400000000001s)]
*  At the same time, watch how the prosecutor characterizes the pedophile's actions the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=655.94s)]
*  night he was shot. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=659.62s)]
*  So what does he do that night? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=661.58s)]
*  Oh, let me tell you all the awful things Joseph Rosen bombed it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=663.5s)]
*  He tipped over a porta potty that had no one in it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=667.98s)]
*  He swung a chain. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=672.02s)]
*  He lit a metal garbage dumpster on fire. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=674.02s)]
*  Oh, and there's this empty wooden flatbed trailer that they pulled out in the middle [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=679.1s)]
*  of the road and they tipped it over to stop some bearcats and they lit it on fire. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=683.3000000000001s)]
*  Oh, and he said some bad words. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=689.0200000000001s)]
*  He said the N-word. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=690.62s)]
*  That's one of the weirdest things that's ever happened in open court. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=695.62s)]
*  That's the prosecutor. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=698.34s)]
*  That's a government official mocking the idea that it's a big deal to light cars on fire [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=700.1800000000001s)]
*  to keep the police from coming in and restoring order. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=706.38s)]
*  It's just not a big deal at all. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=708.9399999999999s)]
*  That's what the prosecutor's telling us. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=711.26s)]
*  That's what he just said. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=712.5s)]
*  He's also saying, by the way, it's not a big deal to scream racial slurs in public. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=714.58s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=719.1s)]
*  Since when is that true? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=720.1s)]
*  This is lunacy. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=721.1s)]
*  By the way, the jury was never allowed to hear the details of the life of this guy, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=722.1s)]
*  Joseph Rosenbaum. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=726.58s)]
*  He had quite a history. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=727.58s)]
*  Does seem sort of relevant, actually. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=730.5s)]
*  The rest of the media is not going to tell you anything about it, so we will. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=731.94s)]
*  In 2002, Joseph Rosenbaum was charged by a grand jury with 11 counts of child molestation, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=735.02s)]
*  including forcible sodomy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=739.46s)]
*  This wasn't, you know, he was 19 and he had a 17-year-old girlfriend. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=741.5799999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=745.18s)]
*  He raped children. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=746.18s)]
*  The victims were five boys between the ages of 9 and 11. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=747.18s)]
*  Ultimately, Rosenbaum was sentenced to 10 years in prison for this. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=750.38s)]
*  When he got out of prison, Rosenbaum destroyed his ankle monitor, the one he was required [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=753.78s)]
*  to wear. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=757.66s)]
*  The day he died, Rosenbaum had an open case for domestic abuse. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=758.8199999999999s)]
*  They're defending this guy. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=762.5s)]
*  Just hours before he threatened to kill Kyle Rosen, Rittenhouse, Rosenbaum had been released [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=764.3s)]
*  from a mental hospital. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=768.9s)]
*  He was being treated for some sort of disorder, obviously. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=769.9s)]
*  He tried to go back to his fiance, but she had a no-contact order after she pressed charges [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=772.8399999999999s)]
*  against him a month earlier for hitting her. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=776.9399999999999s)]
*  So this is the man they're telling you was a model citizen. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=780.4599999999999s)]
*  Let me just remind people of the names of the victims. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=784.42s)]
*  Joseph Rosenbaum, who was 36 years old, Anthony Huber, who was 26, Gage Grosskreutz, who was [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=786.42s)]
*  only 27 years old, was injured. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=792.58s)]
*  These are the victims. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=794.62s)]
*  These are the people that people ought to remember are the people who were hurt here, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=795.62s)]
*  not the person who was crying on the stand today. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=799.7s)]
*  So if you were an honest progressive, wouldn't you ask yourself, what are all these people [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=804.18s)]
*  doing at a Joe Biden rally three days after the Democratic convention? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=808.14s)]
*  They're all on my side, but I notice that all of them are actually horrible. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=811.1s)]
*  This is not a cross-section of America. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=815.66s)]
*  These are the worst people in America. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=817.02s)]
*  Joseph Rosenbaum, the child rapist? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=819.26s)]
*  What about the other victims? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=821.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, our media tells you a main victim is a guy called Gage Grosskreutz. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=822.9000000000001s)]
*  He's the guy who ran up to Kyle Rittenhouse and pointed a loaded gun in his face, for [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=827.4200000000001s)]
*  which he's never been charged, by the way. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=830.7s)]
*  That's not a big deal because he votes the right way. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=831.9000000000001s)]
*  Who is this guy? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=833.98s)]
*  Well, Grosskreutz, it turns out, also has a lengthy criminal history. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=834.98s)]
*  That includes an arrest for hitting his own grandmother in the face. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=837.9000000000001s)]
*  Just six days before he testified in the trial, in fact, Grosskreutz was in court on a DUI [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=841.3800000000001s)]
*  charge, which Joe Biden says is not a big deal, but most of us grew up thinking you [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=845.3800000000001s)]
*  were not supposed to do that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=848.3800000000001s)]
*  Several years ago, Grosskreutz was charged with smashing the bedroom window of his ex-girlfriend's [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=850.7s)]
*  home at 4 a.m. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=854.22s)]
*  On the night Kyle Rittenhouse shot him, Grosskreutz has admitted he was carrying an illegal firearm. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=855.5400000000001s)]
*  Oh, no longer a big deal either. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=860.98s)]
*  Gun crimes don't matter if you vote the wrong way. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=863.58s)]
*  So what about the last guy, Anthony Huber? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=865.6600000000001s)]
*  He's the man who hit Kyle Rittenhouse twice in the head with a skateboard. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=868.62s)]
*  Who is he? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=871.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, he's a convicted domestic abuser. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=872.6600000000001s)]
*  According to court records, Huber once told his brother that if he didn't clean a room [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=874.62s)]
*  in his house, he was going to quote, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=877.94s)]
*  Huber said that while he was holding a six inch knife to his brother's stomach. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=879.58s)]
*  Then he grabbed his brother's neck and said this quote, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=885.62s)]
*  Huber pleaded guilty to one counter strangulation that time. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=887.5400000000001s)]
*  So I guess the point is pretty simple. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=894.82s)]
*  There were a lot of violent criminals at this particular Joe Biden rally in Kenosha, Wisconsin [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=896.4200000000001s)]
*  last summer. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=901.2600000000001s)]
*  What are the odds of that? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=902.2600000000001s)]
*  Kind of hard not to contrast it with what happened on, say, January 6th, the insurrection [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=904.26s)]
*  they never stopped telling us about. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=908.66s)]
*  No one has been charged with carrying a gun inside the Capitol building that day. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=910.98s)]
*  How many fires did they set? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=914.1s)]
*  None that we're aware of. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=915.98s)]
*  But they get to rot in solitary confinement anyway. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=917.54s)]
*  Why Gage Grosskreutz gets the seal of approval from MSNBC anchors for appointing a loaded [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=919.9s)]
*  gun he was carrying illegally in the face of a child. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=925.86s)]
*  So the Kyle Rittenhouse trial is wrapping up and the people who engineered the political [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=930.36s)]
*  prosecution behind this are still in power. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=934.52s)]
*  One of the main takeaways from all of this is that those people are now more brazen than [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=937.12s)]
*  they have ever been. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=942.16s)]
*  They're just saying it out loud now. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-Qiz8g4Zc&t=943.16s)]
