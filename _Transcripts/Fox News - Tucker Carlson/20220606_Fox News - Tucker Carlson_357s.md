# Peter Navarro joins Tucker Carlson following FBI arrest over January 6 committee subpoena
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o)
*  The January 6 committee has just hired a former producer of Good Morning America called James [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=0.0s)]
*  Goldston. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  He'll be overseeing the committee's primetime hearings on Thursday night. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  So the show trial now has a production crew. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=10.92s)]
*  And of course, we'll be covering that in great detail on Thursday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=13.16s)]
*  By arresting Peter Navarro, they're hoping to shut up one of the most vocal critics before [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=17.12s)]
*  it begins. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=20.2s)]
*  But Peter Navarro is a brave man. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=21.44s)]
*  He's not shutting up. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  He joins us now for his first interview since being arrested. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  He is, as we told you, a former senior White House adviser and the author of Taking Back [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=26.64s)]
*  Trump's America, Why We Lost the White House and How We'll Win It Back. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=30.8s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Peter Navarro, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  How was this allowed? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=38.32s)]
*  This is so outside the bounds, unless I'm missing something, and I hope if so, you'll correct [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=41.28s)]
*  it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=45.92s)]
*  This is so outside the bounds of how a civilized country behaves. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=46.92s)]
*  Did you see it coming? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  If not, how do you think this was allowed to happen? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=51.92s)]
*  Certainly, I saw it coming. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=55.76s)]
*  We have entered really dangerous, unprecedented waters. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=59.0s)]
*  Tucker, I was in a position where a partisan committee has weaponized the investigatory [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=63.68s)]
*  powers for the purpose of preventing Donald Trump from ever getting back in the White [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=73.92s)]
*  House. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=80.24s)]
*  They subpoenaed me illegally, and I was faced with the untenable choice of upholding executive [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=82.0s)]
*  privilege, which was not my privilege to waive. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=90.92s)]
*  That's Donald Trump's privilege to waive. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=93.84s)]
*  So I did my duty to the president. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=96.16s)]
*  I did my duty to this country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=98.56s)]
*  And here we sit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  And the civil suit I filed, Tucker, I hope will be historically important, because there's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=103.0s)]
*  really two constitutional issues here at stake. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=107.56s)]
*  The first, with this weaponization of Congress's investigatory powers, is a clear violation [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=111.28s)]
*  of the separation of powers in our Constitution. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=117.56s)]
*  The legislative branch is not supposed to be the judge, jury and execution. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=120.36s)]
*  I heard one of your commentators there, when you played that clip, the purpose was to punish [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=125.6s)]
*  Peter Navarro. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=129.6s)]
*  That's not their role. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=130.88s)]
*  That's the judiciary's role. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=132.12s)]
*  So that alone is sufficient to render what they have done illegal and therefore what [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=133.64s)]
*  the Department of Justice did illegal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=139.76s)]
*  But the bigger issue here, Tucker, and this is where the Department of Justice and committee [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=142.12s)]
*  were so disingenuous. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=147.32s)]
*  I assert the executive privilege prevents me from complying with their subpoenas. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=149.12s)]
*  And instead of going to talk and negotiate the privilege with Donald Trump, as the law [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=156.36s)]
*  requires, they went into this fanciful and absurd notion that Biden, a sitting incumbent [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=160.92s)]
*  president, could strip his immediate predecessor of executive privilege and me, a staff member [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=166.72s)]
*  to the president, of what the Justice Department itself, as you pointed out, has absolute testimonial [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=173.56s)]
*  immunity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=180.92s)]
*  It's absurd on its face. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=181.92s)]
*  Can every step along the line... [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=183.4s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=185.64s)]
*  Well, I have no doubt that it's unconstitutional and it's clearly an abuse of power, but I [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=186.64s)]
*  just want to get to the center of it, which is January 6th. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=189.72s)]
*  This is the January 6th committee. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=192.72s)]
*  You saw Liz Cheney in that disgusting, ridiculous, fawning interview say it's also chilling. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=194.72s)]
*  Did you have anything at all to do with January 6th? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=204.88s)]
*  No. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=205.88s)]
*  You had that exactly right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=206.88s)]
*  And what you and I have now both said, and which is absolute fact, is that the mission [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=210.2s)]
*  of that partisan witch hunt, Kangaroo Committee, which is unduly authorized and not properly [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=216.94s)]
*  constituted and has no subpoena power, they have only one mission, to concoct a fake hoax [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=224.66s)]
*  around January 6th based on criminal charges against Trump to prevent him from running [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=231.42s)]
*  for reelection and taking back the White House in 2025 January. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=237.22s)]
*  That's all this is about. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=242.62s)]
*  Look, Tucker, this was... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=245.86s)]
*  You said it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=248.86s)]
*  I live right next door, 50 yards from the FBI. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=249.86s)]
*  On Wednesday night, I sent an email to Patricia Alloy, the deputy attorney, and said, look, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=253.02s)]
*  I'm seeking a modus vivendi here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=260.38s)]
*  I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=262.14s)]
*  Let's see what we can do. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=263.98s)]
*  I gave her the name of an attorney. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=265.58s)]
*  I told Walter Giordano, the FBI agent, who'd come banging on my door the week before, hey, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=267.3s)]
*  Walter, I'm here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=273.18s)]
*  Just call me whatever you need. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=275.1s)]
*  You don't need to bang on my door. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=276.1s)]
*  They chose a different route. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=277.5s)]
*  They didn't call my attorney. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=279.18s)]
*  Instead, they went with this shock and awe terrorist strategy to let me go to the airport [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=280.66s)]
*  and then take me with five agents like I'm an al-Qaeda terrorist, rock me into a car, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=288.02s)]
*  and the next thing I know, I'm in leg irons, handcuffs, strip search. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=294.26s)]
*  I mean, it was not without comedy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=298.06s)]
*  I mean, at one point, the FBI agents couldn't find the door to go into where I was supposed [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=299.78s)]
*  to go. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=304.3s)]
*  The fingerprint machine didn't work. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=305.3s)]
*  But people do not want to sit in solitary confinement in leg irons, denied food, denied [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  water, denied an attorney. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  And this is what we live in. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=316.3s)]
*  I mean, I studied Kafka in college. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=318.5s)]
*  It took me till I was 72 to understand Kafka. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  You can't arrest people for political reasons. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=326.26s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=328.74s)]
*  We've invited every member of that committee on this show. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=329.74s)]
*  All of them are too cowardly. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=332.86s)]
*  Kinzinger, Cheney, cowards. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=333.86s)]
*  But I just think this is a huge change in the way this country operates. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=335.86s)]
*  And I wanted to note that and extend our sympathy to you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=339.5s)]
*  Peter Navarro, thank you and Godspeed. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=341.94s)]
*  Thank you for your coverage, sir. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjL6mS5IU9o&t=344.98s)]
