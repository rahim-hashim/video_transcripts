# Tucker slams late-night hosts over 'Climate Night'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k)
*  So it used to be if you had a late night TV show, your job was to entertain people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=0.0s)]
*  It's late. People are tired. They want to be amused. They want to laugh. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=5.0s)]
*  You give them comedy. But the rules have changed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=10.0s)]
*  Now if you have a late night TV show, your job is to provide wooden corporate propaganda at full force. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=13.0s)]
*  Beat people over the head with talking points until they submit. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=19.0s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=23.0s)]
*  Last night, seven late night hosts gathered for a special climate on climate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=25.0s)]
*  You can imagine how fun that was and how honest. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=30.0s)]
*  Here's some of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=34.0s)]
*  If you are a person living on this planet, your future is in peril. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=36.0s)]
*  That's a scientific fact. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=40.0s)]
*  And yes, there are other issues that are all very important. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=42.0s)]
*  The pandemic, systemic racism, income inequality, immigration, gun violence. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=45.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. If we don't address climate change, none of those issues will matter at all. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=50.0s)]
*  The car is going off a cliff and we're fiddling with the radio. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=55.0s)]
*  We are way past climate denial. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=59.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. We got to act soon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=61.0s)]
*  And you have to give us more power or else you'll die. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=64.0s)]
*  Because it turns out the root cause of climate change is not actually carbon. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=69.0s)]
*  It's you. You did it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=74.0s)]
*  Stephen Colbert explained that people who believe in God are responsible for climate change. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=78.0s)]
*  Are you saying that individual actions are useless because these corporations are the real problem? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=83.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=90.0s)]
*  Oh good. Because I'm not telling you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=92.0s)]
*  It's also religion. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=94.0s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=95.0s)]
*  The concept of an afterlife gives you people the false hope of an escape hatch. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=96.0s)]
*  Oh, religious people. Right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=101.0s)]
*  They're the ones who murdered tens of millions of people in the 20th century. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=106.0s)]
*  It wasn't the atheists. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=111.0s)]
*  Colbert was honest enough to acknowledge he doesn't follow any of these climate rules because they're for you, not him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=114.0s)]
*  And I mean this sincerely. I'm a huge hypocrite. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=120.0s)]
*  I'll never do anything that's inconvenient to me. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=124.0s)]
*  That's why there has to be systemic change backed up by government action to make everyone make the right choices. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=127.0s)]
*  Not the easy ones. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=135.0s)]
*  Wait a second. If someone forces you to do something, it's not really a choice, is it? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=137.0s)]
*  You can't make someone make the right choices. That doesn't even make sense. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=143.0s)]
*  If you make someone do something, it's a command. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=148.0s)]
*  That person is your slave. You own that person. No choice involved. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=152.0s)]
*  Not to be pedantic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=157.0s)]
*  For our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5DXmjV4a4k&t=165.0s)]
