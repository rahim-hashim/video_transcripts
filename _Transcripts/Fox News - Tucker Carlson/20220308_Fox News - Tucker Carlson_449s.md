# These people are trying to destroy our country: UFC fighter
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4)
*  So, of all the people we've seen weigh in on Ukraine, maybe none has put the American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=0.0s)]
*  position more succinctly or expressed it more wisely than a man called Bryce Mitchell. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=5.66s)]
*  We played a portion of his comments on this show yesterday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  Bryce Mitchell is a cattle farmer from Arkansas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=13.86s)]
*  He's also a fairly well-known UFC fighter. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=15.46s)]
*  Last week, he was asked, what do you think about Ukraine? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=18.18s)]
*  And here's part of what he said. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=21.06s)]
*  I'm not going nowhere to fight none of these wars for these politicians. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=22.96s)]
*  I'm staying at home and when the war comes to Arkansas, I will dig my boots in the ground [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=26.38s)]
*  and I will die for everything I love and I will not retreat. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=30.619999999999997s)]
*  If this country is invaded and everybody's saying, well, we got to evacuate, we got to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=34.5s)]
*  leave, I will not. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=39.5s)]
*  I will dig my boots in the Arkansas soil and I will fight for the people that I love, for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  the land that I love and the way of life that I love. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=45.7s)]
*  But I'm not going overseas to fight. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=47.7s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=50.739999999999995s)]
*  A lot of people you see on TV would leave instantly if we were invaded. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=53.06s)]
*  There's been polling on it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=57.58s)]
*  It shows it pretty clearly. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=58.58s)]
*  You should pay attention to the people who wouldn't leave, who would fight for their [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=59.58s)]
*  country and for their people, the ones they love. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=61.9s)]
*  Bryce Mitchell's obviously in that category. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=65.5s)]
*  He won his fight on Saturday. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=67.5s)]
*  We should tell you, he promised to give half the purse to a charity in Arkansas to help [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=68.5s)]
*  children with medical conditions. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  We are honored to have Bryce Mitchell join us tonight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=73.5s)]
*  Bryce, thanks so much for coming on and for what you said. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=75.82s)]
*  I haven't seen anybody express it better than you did. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=79.22s)]
*  Why did you say that? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=82.58s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for having me, brother. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=86.7s)]
*  And I said that because that's the first thing that I thought when he asked me and I was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=88.46s)]
*  trying to give him the best answer that I could. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=91.86s)]
*  And that's just my genuine thoughts on the subject. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=93.74s)]
*  How do you get to be so honest when everyone else is afraid to say what they think and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=96.7s)]
*  you just kind of say it? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=101.14s)]
*  Well, I don't have to be worried about being fired from my job for saying what I want to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=104.42s)]
*  say. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=108.78s)]
*  There's a lot of people out there that do agree with me, but they can't say things that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=109.78s)]
*  I get to say even though they think them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=112.58s)]
*  They'll get fired from their job if they come out and say it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=114.9s)]
*  Dana White's pretty good with how he lets us talk and say what we want. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=117.34s)]
*  That is absolutely right and a fair thing to say. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=123.38s)]
*  Now people who say what you have said are often denounced as unpatriotic or traitors [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=126.82s)]
*  to their country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=132.74s)]
*  Does that confuse you? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=133.74s)]
*  The first thing you said was I will fight and die for Arkansas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=134.74s)]
*  That would be the greatest honor I could ever have, brother. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  So I'm far from not being a patriot. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=143.22s)]
*  That would be the greatest thing I could do is die defending this land. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=146.18s)]
*  So I'm not afraid to do that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=149.06s)]
*  I'm just not wanting to go waste my life fighting for some of these battles that I don't even [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=151.02s)]
*  believe in. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  I believe our leaders, a lot of these elites are guilty of treason. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  What they've done is just treasonous and I'm sure you know what I'm talking about a little bit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  It's funny that they're accusing you of treason. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  Why do you think almost everyone in the media, and I mean almost everybody, in both political [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=175.18s)]
*  parties and of course the White House are all on the same page that you need to get [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=180.46s)]
*  behind this war with Russia? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=185.46s)]
*  Why is that so important to them? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=187.46s)]
*  Do you have any sense? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=188.62s)]
*  Well, I don't exactly know what their agenda is with the whole war on Russia, but I do [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=192.62s)]
*  know that all that money that's going to the Biden family through Hunter Biden, he doesn't [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=196.26000000000002s)]
*  have the merit for that position he's got over there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=203.5s)]
*  They've used our tax dollars to bribe him a job. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=205.74s)]
*  If me or you did what Nancy Pelosi did and got millions in stocks, we'd go to prison [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=209.3s)]
*  for insider trading, but she does it and she's filthy rich. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=213.9s)]
*  Their families are getting very greatly compensated while they're taxing us to death. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=218.34s)]
*  Inflation's higher than ever. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=226.26s)]
*  They close down all of our pipelines and wonder why the price of oil has gone through the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=227.26s)]
*  roof. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=232.94s)]
*  These people are trying to destroy our country because they are profiting off the downfall [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=234.14s)]
*  of our country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=238.22s)]
*  If y'all don't see what's going on, you are blinded. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=239.22s)]
*  Every day, our inflation gets worse, our debt gets worse. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=242.26s)]
*  Our actual currency is controlled by a small group called the Federal Reserve. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=248.1s)]
*  There ain't federal and ain't a reserve. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=251.7s)]
*  So it's insidious in nature. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=253.98s)]
*  It's made to control. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=257.26s)]
*  We have a lot of problems and it's going to take a lot of things to fix it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=258.5s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=263.78s)]
*  It's amazing what you're saying, all of which is in my view true. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  So for our viewers who aren't familiar with you because we were so struck by that clip [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=268.78s)]
*  that we played last night and part of it tonight, we got another clip. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=273.38s)]
*  This is you training at your ranch in Arkansas. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=276.61999999999995s)]
*  We're going to play it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=278.9s)]
*  I'm training here all the time when nobody's looking. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=287.9s)]
*  I got a log out there that I curl and then I lift it over my head and then I run in a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  circle and then I'll fill up the wheelbarrow with dirt and push it around. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=295.5s)]
*  The number one reason I won't go to a big gym is because of the secrecy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=301.3s)]
*  Your plans need to be dark as night. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=305.9s)]
*  So that's where you live. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=311.58s)]
*  So I mean I think it's fair to say you're pretty rooted in the ground of this country. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=312.98s)]
*  This country is made up of small businesses and people like myself that are anything from [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=321.42s)]
*  rich but that work hard every day and have goals and that's what this whole thing is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=328.5s)]
*  attacking. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=335.9s)]
*  It's attacking the small business. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=336.9s)]
*  The mom and pa shops, they're paying the consequences. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  All this COVID stuff, it's killed small businesses. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=342.5s)]
*  What they're doing, they're giving bailouts to the big businesses and in Arkansas they [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=345.62s)]
*  shut down businesses for three or four months, however long it was. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=349.98s)]
*  They wouldn't let us open up our gyms and this and that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=353.82s)]
*  And we're tired of this politics crap that's going on. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=356.42s)]
*  It's evil is what's going on. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=359.82s)]
*  Evil has took over this nation and we ain't afraid of it and we're ready to fight. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=362.02s)]
*  I think you're exactly right in your assessment. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=366.78s)]
*  Tell me about since that clip of you saying that at the press conference has spread so [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=369.22s)]
*  widely, 20 people have sent it to me. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=375.22s)]
*  What do your friends and neighbors in Arkansas say to you? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=377.86s)]
*  Do they agree with you? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=380.98s)]
*  I've had people coming out to Woodward and just supporting me and then they've been telling [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=384.98s)]
*  me also, you know, you need to load your guns up because somebody's going to come out there [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=390.06s)]
*  and try to take you out for what you're saying. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=393.82s)]
*  And that's how worried people are about the state of their country. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=395.86s)]
*  My friends think that my life could be at risk because I'm coming out here and speaking [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=399.42s)]
*  truth. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=404.1s)]
*  I'm saying, hey, load your guns up, be ready. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  And that's just I'm just telling you, that's what people are telling me right now. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=408.22s)]
*  You know, they are worried about my health because I'm coming out and speaking the truth. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=411.5s)]
*  That's the type of suppression and oppression that we're living in, brother. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=415.14000000000004s)]
*  People are worried about it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=418.86s)]
*  Well, you hate to think that's true, but I know where they're coming from. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=419.86s)]
*  There's a lot of malice out there. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=423.74s)]
*  I think you speak for many people and I'm really glad you're brave enough to say that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-AAakqEH4&t=424.98s)]
