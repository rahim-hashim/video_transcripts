# Tucker: Nothing like this has ever happened in our country
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Tonight if you lived in this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=0.0s)]
*  country 15 years ago and you've got a good memory you may remember the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=3.66s)]
*  creation of something called the National Security Division at the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=7.78s)]
*  Department of Justice. It was created back in 2005 when they re-upped the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=11.5s)]
*  Patriot Act. Now the point of the National Security Division we were told [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=16.62s)]
*  at the time was to conduct quote counter-terrorism and counter-espionage [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=20.7s)]
*  operations against foreign adversaries. This was the big stuff. Mostly it was [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=25.14s)]
*  Islamic terror which was the primary threat of that time but these are also [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=29.58s)]
*  the people in charge of busting Chinese spies who are trying to steal our [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=33.699999999999996s)]
*  nuclear secrets, stopping suicide bombers and hijackings. Not small stuff, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=36.9s)]
*  crimes that threaten the nation. That was then. Then Joe Biden became president in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=41.58s)]
*  January and the entire mission of the United States government changed and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  turned inward against you. A few days ago the Department of Justice under the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=54.14s)]
*  radical Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the National Security [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=59.54s)]
*  Division has a new domestic mission. According to Garland effective [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=63.1s)]
*  immediately the National Security Division is handling the investigation [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=67.34s)]
*  of quote harassment, intimidation and threats of violence against school board [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=70.74s)]
*  members, teachers and workers in our nation's public schools end quote. So the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=74.86s)]
*  question is who is threatening these teachers and school board members? Is it [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  Al Qaeda? Is it the Russian government? Is it ISIS-K? No, it's parents. Parents are [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=83.94s)]
*  angry about what's happening in schools. Why are they angry? Well take a close [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  look at the people Joe Biden has nominated to senior leadership positions [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=94.62s)]
*  the Department of Education. Take a look at YouTube videos while they still exist [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=97.98s)]
*  of some of the school board meetings across the country over the past year [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=101.34s)]
*  and you will know exactly why parents are mad. Parents who believe in things [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  like biological sex, who oppose racial hierarchies imposed in pre-kindergarten [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=109.74s)]
*  classrooms, teaching kids to hate their parents. Those are the threat according [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=116.22s)]
*  to the Biden administration. You'll notice if you look closely that nowhere in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=122.74s)]
*  Merrick Garland's recent order or the DOJ's press release is any explanation of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=126.74s)]
*  these quote threats of violence. What threats of violence? Has violence occurred [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=131.1s)]
*  meetings? No. Look closer and you'll find this line quote. The Justice Department [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=136.06s)]
*  will also create specialized training and guidance that will help school board [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=141.5s)]
*  members understand the type of behavior that constitutes threats. Oh, so it's a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  propaganda operation funded by you out of the Department of so-called justice [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=151.74s)]
*  designed to tell teachers and school board members that when parents complain [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=155.86s)]
*  it's domestic terrorism. It's not the First Amendment in progress. It's not [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  your constituents voicing legitimate complaints. It's effectively a foreign [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=164.94s)]
*  adversary trying to kill you. The Biden administration is trying to convince [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=169.42s)]
*  school board members using the Department of Justice that they are in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=173.9s)]
*  physical danger from parents and those parents are national security threats. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=176.5s)]
*  Once again, nothing like this has ever happened in this country. This is an [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=182.22s)]
*  utter perversion of the mission and the power of the United States Department of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=186.02s)]
*  Justice. It is almost impossible to overstate how sinister and crazy this is. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=190.42s)]
*  We almost never play the equivalence game because it's tiresome, but in this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=196.33999999999997s)]
*  case, it's hard to resist. Imagine if Donald Trump's DOJ designated, say, CNN [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=199.42s)]
*  anchors as domestic terrorists, put it in writing and then told men with guns to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=205.98s)]
*  enforce the law. How would that go over? We, for one, would be outraged by that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=210.89999999999998s)]
*  All decent Americans would, and it would in fact be less of a stretch than this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=216.17999999999998s)]
*  order. A lot of CNN anchors made excuses for violence during the riots last year. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=219.74s)]
*  But the media aren't upset about this. When powerless suburban parents resist [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=225.66s)]
*  having nihilistic ruling class ideologies imposed by force on their [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=229.94s)]
*  children, our media seem to believe it is perfectly fine to designate them [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=233.34s)]
*  terrorists and threaten them with firearms. In a version of America where [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=237.18s)]
*  school board meetings have become the new culture war battlegrounds with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=241.18s)]
*  children caught in the crosshairs, sometimes literally and sometimes [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=244.22s)]
*  figuratively. Right now, everyone from the Proud Boys to the Oath Keepers to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=247.38s)]
*  QAnon influencers are trying to encourage their members, their followers, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=251.3s)]
*  their maniacs to show up at school board hearings. Some behavior is so bad, it's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=256.5s)]
*  being compared to domestic terrorism. This becomes a security crisis in a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=261.82s)]
*  sense for the nation. How one Republican senator is pretending school board [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=266.54s)]
*  harassment and intimidation aren't off the charts. Similar tactics to what [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=270.74s)]
*  happened on January 6th that now are being turned against school boards [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=275.3s)]
*  nationwide in a trend that's really disturbing and sinister. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=279.38s)]
*  Conservatives manufactured outrage over masks and history lessons took our [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=282.86s)]
*  school boards hostage like a bunch of screaming maniacs. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=286.86s)]
*  So the federal government has a designated American parents who are [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=291.14s)]
*  unhappy with the education their children are receiving as domestic [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=295.26s)]
*  terrorists, and the media are defending it. This is so shameful, it's hard to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=298.86s)]
*  describe. The entire point of a free press is to protect the weak from the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=304.46s)]
*  strong. But as usual, and more flagrantly every day, our media does [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=310.38s)]
*  exactly the opposite. They slobber over billionaires, they defend the powerful, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=315.26s)]
*  they call you a bigot if you challenge George Soros. And on the other hand, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=320.26s)]
*  they clap like seals as working class people go to jail for thought crimes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  They're trying to pretend that's not what they're doing, that they're not [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=330.5s)]
*  sucking up to power, that's not the Praetorian Guard for the Biden [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=332.3s)]
*  administration, but they are. They're telling you this is about domestic [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=336.3s)]
*  terrorism, they're repeating Merrick Garland's own words. It has nothing to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  do with freedom of speech. On MSNBC this week, the daughter of the United [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=344.14s)]
*  States Senator, that would be Robert Menendez of New Jersey, one of the Biden [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=348.38s)]
*  administration's closest allies in the Senate, promised that she would air [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=351.74s)]
*  definitive proof that parents who dare to challenge the orthodoxies of the Joe [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=355.38s)]
*  Biden administration are in fact a grave threat to national security. She [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=360.3s)]
*  would show us proof that the National Security Division needs to investigate [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=364.74s)]
*  these parents, treat them like criminals, for daring to speak up at their own [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=367.74s)]
*  school board meetings before members of the school board they elected to run [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=371.54s)]
*  schools they pay for that educate their children. Here's the evidence she [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=375.94s)]
*  presented. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=381.18s)]
*  Frank, I want to play some more sound of these school board meetings so we can [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=382.94s)]
*  get a sense of just how out of control some of them are getting. Take a listen. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=386.94s)]
*  Don't put masks on our kids anymore, because I'm telling you what, I'm a mom [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=392.94s)]
*  who's fearless and I will come after you. You're allowing child abuse. You're [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=396.94s)]
*  allowing child abuse. You're allowing child abuse. You're allowing child abuse. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=402.17999999999995s)]
*  So Frank, things have become so scary at these meetings that the organization [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  representing school boards across the country is asking the federal [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=411.06s)]
*  government to help, arguing that the classification of these actions could be [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=413.94s)]
*  the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=417.9s)]
*  So mothers stand up before a school board, which is their constitutional [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=422.54s)]
*  right, in fact their duty as parents, to say that they believe based on a lot of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=426.34s)]
*  scientific evidence that their children are being hurt by a policy that makes no [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=431.74s)]
*  sense. Imagine looking at that tape and blaming the moms and suggesting that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=435.34s)]
*  their behavior is, quote, scary and they're terrorists and the FBI should [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=440.94s)]
*  show up at their house and hassle them, like their Al Qaeda or ISIS-K, assuming [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=445.06s)]
*  that even exists. What did they say? Don't put masks on our kids anymore, it's child [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=449.14s)]
*  abuse. Well, actually that's true. And anyone who's looked at the data knows [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  that it's true. Belgian pediatricians, for example, in the Belgian Academy for [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=456.85999999999996s)]
*  Medicine, not a third world country, just issued this assessment of masks in [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=461.06s)]
*  school. Here it is, quote, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=464.97999999999996s)]
*  against the principle of first do no harm, which is included in the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=470.9s)]
*  Hippocratic oath that doctors took. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=474.06s)]
*  Now that's not some angry mom from Laguna Beach. Those are physicians saying [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=485.82s)]
*  that. And if you look around and you should, you will not find a single [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=489.62s)]
*  scientific study anywhere in the world that fundamentally contradicts that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=493.78s)]
*  There is no science, none, behind these mask mandates for children. In fact, just [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=499.14s)]
*  days ago, Joe Biden's Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, tried to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=504.98s)]
*  cite his study to back the administration's forced masking of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=508.38s)]
*  children, which is a total outrage. And when he used this study to justify a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=511.46s)]
*  political decision, the senior author of the study, Tracy Hoag, said Cardona had [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  no idea what he was talking about and it completely misrepresented her research, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=520.02s)]
*  which, by the way, had no control group. So by definition, doesn't prove anything. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=523.34s)]
*  But don't bother. Don't even bother getting rational on this subject. If you [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=528.86s)]
*  dare to cite scientific conclusions, you are a domestic extremist and the media [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=533.74s)]
*  will demand that you be investigated by the FBI. And they're justifying this in [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=538.46s)]
*  exactly the same way that the Chinese government explained the way murders it [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=542.66s)]
*  committed in Tiananmen Square. They're accusing people who have been [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=545.74s)]
*  completely wronged by the government of undermining domestic stability by [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=549.18s)]
*  complaining about it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=553.0600000000001s)]
*  What used to be called legitimate civic disagreement is now a threat to the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=555.06s)]
*  nation. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=561.18s)]
*  Get that moron off television. That's hurting the country. I mean, come on now. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=578.78s)]
*  They're racist now. They're racist because they don't want their kids to be [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=582.46s)]
*  masked. Imagine saying something like that. There are underlying forces at work, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=586.1s)]
*  secret forces you can't see. Must be QAnon or white supremacists. There are no [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=591.9s)]
*  organized white supremacist forces in this country. We have a lot of problems. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=597.26s)]
*  That's not one of them. The point is we don't like their politics, therefore they [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=600.26s)]
*  don't deserve civil liberties. That's what they're saying. That's what they believe. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=605.42s)]
*  You have to wonder if any of these people have ever seen a school board meeting or [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=609.98s)]
*  if they're just repeating what they're told. It's not the parents who were [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=612.74s)]
*  causing chaos. They didn't start this. They had a totally ordinary and [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=615.78s)]
*  justified expectation that their kids would be educated as kids have been [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=620.7s)]
*  educated in this country for more than 100 years in public schools. The schools [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=624.46s)]
*  themselves changed and parents slowly woke up to this fact. Their kids are [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=628.82s)]
*  being taught racism in schools. They're being hurt. What the hell are you doing? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=632.62s)]
*  So parents go to meetings to voice objections to teachers who are advocating [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=636.3s)]
*  racial segregation and book burning and they're doing it on camera. They're not [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=642.06s)]
*  doing it in secret. They're not plotting. This isn't the QAnon Army. These are [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=646.42s)]
*  just normal Americans. Here's tape from Virginia back in May. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=649.66s)]
*  It's funny how they are so afraid of their children seeing another view of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=654.9799999999999s)]
*  sexuality, gender or religion. If you want to talk about books that are [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=660.7s)]
*  assigned, let's read To Kill a Mockingbird Together. If you aren't willing [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=666.1400000000001s)]
*  to consider the racial trauma this assigned book causes black children [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=671.5400000000001s)]
*  with its white savior, saviorism, then you have no business discussing any [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=677.9000000000001s)]
*  books. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=683.26s)]
*  Well, exactly. If you're telling kids that Dr. Seuss and To Kill a Mockingbird, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=684.94s)]
*  both of which are explicitly anti racist and were before that was even a term [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=690.22s)]
*  thought up by some grifter at Boston University, if you really believe that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=694.58s)]
*  you're a lunatic, and let's just say that out loud, you're a lunatic. And if [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=698.94s)]
*  you're complaining about it, you're not the one waging chaos. Look around on [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=702.9s)]
*  cable news and you won't find anybody explaining what's actually going on. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=706.94s)]
*  Instead, you'll find people like Nicole Wallace barking about how people who [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=711.46s)]
*  don't agree with her don't deserve civil liberties. We almost never use her name [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=714.7s)]
*  on the air. Nicole Wallace is the physical embodiment of virtually [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=718.82s)]
*  everything that's wrong with this country. She is in a word loathsome. But [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=722.22s)]
*  let's be completely honest. If the federal government ever decided and then [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=725.34s)]
*  declared publicly that Nicole Wallace was a terrorist for her political [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  opinions, we would unhesitatingly leap to her defense with maximum vehemence. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=732.2600000000001s)]
*  We would do it instantly and we wouldn't stop because we believe in civil [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=737.9000000000001s)]
*  liberties. Would she do the same for us? Of course not. If the entire staff of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=741.5400000000001s)]
*  this show was arrested tomorrow for our beliefs, Nicole Wallace would celebrate. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=746.46s)]
*  And that's the difference. We believe in civil liberties and they don't. How can [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=750.1s)]
*  you tell? Has Nicole Wallace or anyone else at MSNBC said a single word about [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=754.7s)]
*  the federal government spying on people's Google searches? That's happening. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=758.5400000000001s)]
*  Accidentally, the feds just unsealed court documents showing that the DOJ under [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=762.4200000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden has been obtaining sensitive private information from any American [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=767.82s)]
*  who typed in certain keywords into a Google search. A Minnesota judge, for [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=771.98s)]
*  example, recently approved a secret warrant requiring Google to provide [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=776.26s)]
*  tracking information on, quote, any user within the city of Edina, Minnesota, who [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=779.86s)]
*  searched a fraud victim's name. Oh, is it a stretch to think that this could be [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=785.34s)]
*  extended to ideological crimes, which are the crimes the Biden administration [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=791.22s)]
*  really cares about? No, it's not a stretch at all. In fact, of course, it's [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=794.98s)]
*  happening and no one on television even mentions it because they think you [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=796.9399999999999s)]
*  deserve it because they don't think you have civil liberties because they don't [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=800.18s)]
*  believe in God. Therefore, they don't think you got those rights from God. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=802.9s)]
*  They thought you got them from the government and they can be taken away [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=805.74s)]
*  because you've been naughty. And so they applaud when they're taken away. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=807.94s)]
*  Google collects an awful lot of tracking information on its users, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=811.7800000000001s)]
*  including their names, home addresses, browsing history, going back decades. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=814.46s)]
*  So that's a story you would expect a lot of people on the left to be concerned [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=818.1800000000001s)]
*  about. If it was 20 years ago, they would be. The ACLU would be all over it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=820.94s)]
*  It's proof once again that the government has too much surveillance [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=824.62s)]
*  power over American citizens, and they are abusing this to spy on Americans [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=827.38s)]
*  who've done nothing wrong. But not one of the national security experts, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=832.18s)]
*  so-called an MSNBC or CNN, will even mention it. Why is that? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=835.5799999999999s)]
*  Because their job isn't to protect you or civil liberties, but to protect [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=840.3399999999999s)]
*  the party in power. That could be why they're not telling you anything [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=844.3399999999999s)]
*  about Marilyn Garland's personal stake, the attorney general's personal stake [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=847.4599999999999s)]
*  in persecuting people who challenge the insanity we're seeing in school boards [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=852.3s)]
*  across the country. It turns out, Marilyn Garland's daughter is married [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=857.06s)]
*  to a man who is the co-founder of an education service company called [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=861.1s)]
*  Panorama Education, which you will not be surprised to learn, provides materials [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=864.5400000000001s)]
*  on critical race theory to school districts, including dismantling, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=870.0200000000001s)]
*  quote, unconscious bias and systemic racism in schools. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=874.9000000000001s)]
*  Oh, so the thing that parents are complaining about [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=879.3800000000001s)]
*  is the thing that Marilyn Garland's family is getting rich from. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=885.5s)]
*  Two days ago, Marilyn Garland just made it a crime to complain about the beliefs [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=890.02s)]
*  that are enriching his family. Does that make sense? You should know that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=894.18s)]
*  this specific company has raised a ton of money from Mark Zuckerberg's foundation. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=898.42s)]
*  Fairfax County Public Schools just signed a $1.8 million contract with Panorama [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=902.8199999999999s)]
*  to conduct a multi-year social and emotional learning screener that gives [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=907.2199999999999s)]
*  them the right to collect, quote, psychometrics on the school district's students. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=911.2199999999999s)]
*  Do you realize they're collecting psychometrics on your kids? What is a psychometric anyway? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=915.6199999999999s)]
*  This is insane. Some of the questions asked whether students are, quote, sad or, quote, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=919.06s)]
*  gender fluid. It's all making Marilyn Garland's family rich. This is horrifying. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=923.8599999999999s)]
*  It's also potentially illegal. According to the DOJ's own conflict of interest policy, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=928.8199999999999s)]
*  it raises serious ethical issues. But of course it does. The DOJ rules require employees to seek [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=933.38s)]
*  official guidance before, quote, participating in any matter in which his or her impartiality [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=938.66s)]
*  could be questioned. Oh, that would include situations in which matters can, quote, affect [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=943.4599999999999s)]
*  the financial interests of a relative with whom the DOJ employee has a close relationship. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=948.74s)]
*  That would probably include your daughter, Marilyn Garland. Did you do that? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=953.3s)]
*  You can be assured that no one at the DOJ's national security division is investigating [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=957.22s)]
*  that question tonight. Instead, they're promising to go after people to designate [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=960.9s)]
*  people like Elena Fishbein, domestic terrorist. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=965.54s)]
*  Anywhere else. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfeNCH9v-gk&t=978.74s)]
