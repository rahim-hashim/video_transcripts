# Tucker: The standard of living is plummeting
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight there are a lot of things going on around the world at the moment, but we thought [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  we would begin tonight with a report from your own country, just to give you something [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=5.7s)]
*  a little different from what you've been watching every moment of every day for the past three [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=9.78s)]
*  weeks. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=13.22s)]
*  On your screen are pictures from Brooklyn, New York. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=14.3s)]
*  These are people waiting in line at a food bank. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=17.06s)]
*  The queue stretches for blocks. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=19.84s)]
*  It's what we used to call a bread line. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=21.62s)]
*  Most of these people are not homeless or not addicted to drugs. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=24.38s)]
*  Some of them have jobs. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=26.78s)]
*  They just can't afford enough food. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=28.34s)]
*  Very few living Americans have ever seen anything like this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=31.58s)]
*  It's been nearly a hundred years since the United States experienced widespread food [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=34.28s)]
*  shortages. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=38.06s)]
*  That's long enough that most of us have forgotten what it means. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=39.06s)]
*  And here's what it means. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=42.44s)]
*  If you want to make a society volatile, not just angry and divided, which is where we [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=43.86s)]
*  are now, but revolutionary and explosive, then you threaten the food supply. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=47.68s)]
*  Our governments have fallen to rising food prices than to any other cause by far. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=53.62s)]
*  Hungry people are dangerous. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=59.22s)]
*  The Biden administration doesn't seem to notice this is happening or acknowledge it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=61.48s)]
*  Like all neoliberals, they treat unchanging truths about anything as heresy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=66.42s)]
*  They censor them and shut them down. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=70.66s)]
*  They live in an entirely ideological world that they created. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  They believe reality conforms to their theories, not the other way around. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=76.32s)]
*  And why wouldn't they think that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=80.46s)]
*  You can change your sex just by wishing it so. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=81.46s)]
*  You can probably eliminate inflation simply by pretending it doesn't exist. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  When you're God, there are no limits. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=87.74s)]
*  The problem is they're not God. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=90.24s)]
*  They're not even very capable economists. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=92.69999999999999s)]
*  More than a decade of reckless fiscal policies have devalued the U.S. dollar to the point [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=95.22s)]
*  that middle-class people can barely survive in the United States. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  Now the suffering of regular Americans doesn't have the thrilling imminence of, say, war [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=103.74s)]
*  footage from Ukraine. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=107.26s)]
*  But it's real and it matters. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=109.12s)]
*  And here's what it looks like in number terms. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=111.5s)]
*  This year, according to new estimate, rising inflation will cost the average American family [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=115.34s)]
*  $3,500 in extra post-tax income. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=119.34s)]
*  Now that might be bearable if you make 250 grand a year, though you would notice it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=124.62s)]
*  But if you make 35,000 a year, that's a disaster. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=128.9s)]
*  You will radically change the way you live. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=132.88s)]
*  Your standard of living will plummet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=135.2s)]
*  And that's exactly what millions of Americans are facing right now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  It's not a talking point. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  It's real. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  Americans for tax reform found that between November of 2020 and November of 2021, quote, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=143.0s)]
*  the bottom 20% of earners spent $309 more on food, $761 more on energy, 476 more on [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  shelter, 390 more on other commodities, and $224 more on other services. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  And those are the numbers from November. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=162.98s)]
*  They've risen dramatically since then and they're continuing to rise. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=165.98s)]
*  Nationally, meat, poultry, fish, eggs up 13%. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  In San Francisco, a dozen eggs is almost $5. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  Orange juice in Miami is over $4. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  So is a chicken breast in Boston. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  A pound of ground beef hamburger in LA, $6.34. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=180.82s)]
*  A pound of bacon in New York City, $7.28. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=185.94s)]
*  In Chicago last year, green grapes cost $2.50 a pound, another $4. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=189.46s)]
*  The price of chicken wings in the Catskills went from $8 to 20 bucks. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=195.70000000000002s)]
*  Order something else. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=200.3s)]
*  If you tried to drink a pint of Guinness in California yesterday to celebrate St. Patrick's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=201.78s)]
*  Day, it cost you $8.55 for a pint of beer. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=205.38s)]
*  Prices of everything are rising far faster than wages are, a lot faster. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=210.82s)]
*  And that means that in very real terms, the most real, people are becoming poorer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=215.58s)]
*  And not just people who buy things, consumers, but also people who sell them, retailers. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  This is a disaster for small business. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=225.72000000000003s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=227.9s)]
*  For a cold hard lesson on inflation, step into the refrigerator where Karina Godino-Walink [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=229.22000000000003s)]
*  stores the food supplies she just bought for her pop-up food stamp business in Phoenix, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=234.84s)]
*  Arizona. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=239.74s)]
*  Usually it would be, the bonus would be about a dollar a pound. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=240.74s)]
*  Right now it's $1.84 a pound. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=245.66s)]
*  This cheese used to be $9. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=247.46s)]
*  Right now it's like $14.56. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  And that makes it hard for someone like you to run your business. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=252.3s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=254.5s)]
*  It makes it unbelievably difficult for us to predict any pricing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=255.5s)]
*  I can't even say I'm going to charge you a certain price right now because in three days, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=259.98s)]
*  it's probably bound to change, you know. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=266.26s)]
*  And it's never for the better. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=268.7s)]
*  Did you catch that at the end? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=270.18s)]
*  Prices changing every three days. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=272.34s)]
*  It's like Weimar or Zimbabwe. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=274.26s)]
*  That is not the picture of a stable economy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=277.0s)]
*  And it's not just food that's moving fast. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=279.58s)]
*  In the city of Baltimore, the cost of electricity has risen 18% in a single year. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=282.26s)]
*  That does not happen with utilities, but it just did. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=287.58s)]
*  In Philadelphia, the average utility bill rose from $477 a month to $651 a month. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=290.5s)]
*  According to the National Association of Home Builders, building material prices increased [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=298.1s)]
*  almost 21% year over year. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=302.3s)]
*  Overall, lumber prices alone have added almost $19,000 to the price of a home in the past [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=304.98s)]
*  six months. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  That's one of the reasons housing prices are so high. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=313.06s)]
*  And then of course, there's gasoline. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=314.98s)]
*  In Los Angeles, it now costs about $180 to fill a Chevy Suburban. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  One tank of gas, $180. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=322.1s)]
*  Nationally, gas is up nearly 40%. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=325.54s)]
*  And here's what that looks like. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=327.62s)]
*  These prices are eye-popping here at the Chevron. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=330.06s)]
*  It's $7.29 a gallon. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=332.18s)]
*  For a small car with a 12-gallon tank, it would cost you $87 to fill it all the way up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=334.38s)]
*  Of course, we know this is the top end of the spectrum here in California. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  It's the most expensive state. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=343.02s)]
*  The average price for a gallon here is $5.67. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=344.3s)]
*  But we all know that nationally, these prices are through the roof. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=347.76s)]
*  The average cost nationwide now is $4.33 a gallon. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=351.44s)]
*  That's up 63 cents in just a week's time. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=355.88s)]
*  And in fact, right now, the average cost has climbed above $4 a gallon in a staggering [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=358.72s)]
*  38 states. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=364.24s)]
*  Rising gas prices makes people desperate. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=367.24s)]
*  You wouldn't know that from watching television because most people who bring you the news [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=369.64s)]
*  don't know what the price of gas is, and a lot of them don't care because they don't [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=373.76s)]
*  drive themselves. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=376.88s)]
*  But the rest of the country cares very deeply what the price of gas is. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=378.74s)]
*  And in some places, the problem is so bad, gas prices are so expensive, that thieves [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=381.98s)]
*  are taken to drilling holes in gas tanks to steal it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=386.58s)]
*  With the national average at $4.33 a gallon, a troubling new trend is on the rise, gas [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=392.22s)]
*  theft, crimes of opportunity now happening across the country. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=399.22s)]
*  Those are targeting unattended vehicles for gas, but they're not going in through here. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=404.94s)]
*  Instead, they're drilling holes from underneath your car and draining your tank. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=409.36s)]
*  And once the tank is drilled, it can't be fixed. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=415.04s)]
*  Getting a new one could cost drivers more than $1,000. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=418.2s)]
*  Contrary to what you may have learned from Sandy Cortez's TikTok feed, the internal combustion [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=422.32s)]
*  engine is not a sin. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=426.56s)]
*  It's not the basis of a moral crisis. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=428.92s)]
*  It is a miracle upon which all civilization rests. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=431.46000000000004s)]
*  Your Amazon package arrives because of gasoline. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=435.78000000000003s)]
*  So does your Uber Eats. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=439.1s)]
*  You can fly to see your relatives across the country because of gasoline. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=440.70000000000005s)]
*  So when the price of gasoline rises, everyone is affected, no matter who they voted for, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=444.38000000000005s)]
*  and no matter whether they notice it directly or not. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=450.38s)]
*  Here's how people in the state of Texas are reacting to the rising gas prices. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=453.1s)]
*  Gas has reached an all-time record high, and here in Dallas, Texas, it's $4.19 a gallon. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=457.62s)]
*  Let's go talk to Texans and see what they think about these prices. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=463.62s)]
*  They're high. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  Real high. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=467.34000000000003s)]
*  It's f***ing absurd. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  It's f***ing ridiculous. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  We're spending more money to go do, to make money. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=470.34000000000003s)]
*  So it's hard. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=473.94s)]
*  It's outrageous, you know. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=475.94s)]
*  It's kind of outrageous. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=477.94s)]
*  I'm going to lie to you. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=478.94s)]
*  They've been hot for a long time. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=479.94s)]
*  Now they're too hot. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=480.94s)]
*  Will the capital of Ukraine fall to the Russians? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=482.62s)]
*  We certainly hope not. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=484.66s)]
*  Americans care about that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=485.9s)]
*  How high will gas get? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=488.32s)]
*  Americans care about that even more. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=489.44s)]
*  They care deeply because it affects their lives so dramatically. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=491.64s)]
*  And yet the coverage of this is not proportionate. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=495.67999999999995s)]
*  You almost never hear anybody asked, what do you think of the price of gas? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=498.56s)]
*  But if you leave the TV studios of New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, you will find [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=503.67999999999995s)]
*  people really do care. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=507.88s)]
*  Every product in this country, with some exceptions but not that many, is delivered thanks to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  gasoline. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=515.78s)]
*  And that means with rising gas prices, all products become more expensive. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=517.4s)]
*  The cheapest washing machine you can buy at a say, Best Buy in South Carolina right now, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=521.3399999999999s)]
*  $450. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=526.0s)]
*  Furniture embedding across the country is 17% more expensive than it was a year ago. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=527.56s)]
*  12 months ago, a 28 cubic foot Samsung stainless steel fridge was selling for $1700 at Home [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=532.4s)]
*  Depot. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  It's now $2000. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  And so on. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=541.6s)]
*  For everything. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=542.64s)]
*  And particularly for vehicles. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=543.64s)]
*  The average price of a used car is up more than 30% nationally. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=545.76s)]
*  It's up 35% in Massachusetts and Tennessee. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=549.06s)]
*  It's up 38% in Florida and Maryland. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=552.0s)]
*  It's up 40% or more in Louisiana, New York, Montana, and North Dakota. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=555.06s)]
*  That means the average cost of a used car in the state of Montana is now more than $42,000 [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=560.58s)]
*  for a used car. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=566.9s)]
*  Some with high mileage. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=568.6s)]
*  By comparison, last March, the average used Toyota sold for $20,000. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=570.58s)]
*  The average used Toyota now goes for $28,000. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=575.58s)]
*  These are real numbers with real effects. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  To restate, the standard of living of Americans who for almost 100 years have enjoyed the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=582.58s)]
*  world's highest standard of living in any big country is plummeting. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=589.76s)]
*  So what's the administration doing to fix this? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  What are they doing to help? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=598.86s)]
*  Well, of course, that depends upon whether or not you're Ukrainian. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=599.86s)]
*  If you are, they can help you. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=603.5s)]
*  If you're not, our transportation secretary recommends you take the bus. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=606.2s)]
*  We do have a lot of capacity in public transit, and that's something that I hope becomes a [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=610.3s)]
*  means of choice. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=617.06s)]
*  We need to make sure that there is less pressure on family budgets from transportation, which [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=618.06s)]
*  is often the second biggest budget item after housing itself. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=622.66s)]
*  One of the tools that we have in our toolkit to do that is to make sure there's access [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=627.44s)]
*  to excellent public transportation. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=631.52s)]
*  Take the bus? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  Homeless schizophrenics have been doing it for generations. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  Why shouldn't you? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=638.1s)]
*  You can't afford to drive. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=639.9399999999999s)]
*  That's the transportation secretary. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=641.06s)]
*  So maybe the first question would be, what are you going to do about gas prices, pal? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=643.16s)]
*  The roads are falling apart. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=647.88s)]
*  Maybe you could fix that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=648.88s)]
*  No. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=649.88s)]
*  One of the tools in our toolkit is you can ride the bus with the crazy people and you'll [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=650.88s)]
*  like it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=656.0s)]
*  But that's not their only plan to fight inflation. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=658.08s)]
*  Their other plan? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=662.0s)]
*  Blame others. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=663.5200000000001s)]
*  Now that we live in an America where there's a lot more concentration in certain industries, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=665.96s)]
*  look at the oil industry, look at meat industry, look at groceries generally, that what's happened [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=671.12s)]
*  is these companies have said, you know, we'll pass along costs, but while we're at it and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=678.12s)]
*  talking about rising costs, let's just add an extra big dollop of cost increases to expand [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=683.84s)]
*  our profits. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=691.5200000000001s)]
*  You just heard from someone who's a sitting United States senator whose total reservoir [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=694.36s)]
*  of knowledge about the world is smaller than the sink in your powder room. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=699.6600000000001s)]
*  This is someone who knows literally nothing about how anything works. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=706.0s)]
*  The meat industry? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  What would that be, Senator Warren? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=712.4s)]
*  She has no idea what she's talking about. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=714.24s)]
*  She has no interest in learning why the dollar is less valuable than it was 10 years ago [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=716.34s)]
*  and she has no interest whatsoever in improving your life. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=721.54s)]
*  So the question once again is how long can this continue? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=725.5s)]
*  It's one thing to pretend that boys can compete in girls sports and that's totally natural. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=729.68s)]
*  It's always the way it's been. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=734.1999999999999s)]
*  That may be offensive to people, but when they can't afford to buy groceries, boy, you [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=735.3199999999999s)]
*  are really teetering on the edge of something awful. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=740.52s)]
*  They should wake up soon. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyLkOnCQEos&t=742.64s)]
