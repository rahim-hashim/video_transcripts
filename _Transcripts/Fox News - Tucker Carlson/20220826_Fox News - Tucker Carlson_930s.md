# Tucker Carlson: This story may have prevented Biden from becoming president
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc)
*  Well, they waited until Friday to do it, but the Biden administration has finally released [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=0.0s)]
*  a version of the documents they used to justify the police state raid on Donald Trump's home [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=4.4s)]
*  two weeks ago. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=9.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's heavily redacted. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=10.16s)]
*  In a moment, we'll tell you what is in that warrant and what they seem to be hiding. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=11.76s)]
*  Here's a clue a lot. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=16.56s)]
*  But first, good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=18.68s)]
*  Happy Friday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=20.56s)]
*  Every year since the 1970s, the State Department has published a document called World Military [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=21.72s)]
*  Expenditures and Arms Transfers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=26.42s)]
*  You probably haven't read it, but it is interesting. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=29.68s)]
*  It's a detailed accounting of global arms sales, what weapons were sold and where they [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=32.3s)]
*  wound up after they were. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=37.34s)]
*  The US government published this report in the interest of transparency and then continued [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  to publish it through multiple politically charged scandals and conflicts that would [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  include through Iran-Contra, two separate wars in Iraq and all 20 years that we occupied [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=47.8s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=52.8s)]
*  A report like this would be especially useful to have right now, maybe critical to have [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=53.8s)]
*  as the Biden administration sends billions in high-tech military equipment every month [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  to corrupt oligarchs in Eastern Europe. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  Where are all of those weapons systems going? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=65.92s)]
*  We should know the answer to that, but we don't know. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=68.44s)]
*  Because this year, for the very first time in half a century, the Biden administration [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=71.6s)]
*  has stopped releasing that information. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=75.02s)]
*  They never explained why they stopped. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=77.16s)]
*  They just stopped and no one pushed them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=80.0s)]
*  Now you'd think this would be a scandal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=83.32s)]
*  If there's one thing the news media exists to do, it's to fight for the release of relevant [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=84.8s)]
*  government records. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=89.92s)]
*  Because in a democracy, you have a right to know what is being done in your name, but [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=91.8s)]
*  not anymore. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=94.88s)]
*  That information is classified, Mr. Citizen. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  So you don't get to find out where those billions of dollars of weapons that you're paying for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=99.24s)]
*  are going. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=104.08s)]
*  Who's getting them? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=105.08s)]
*  What are they doing with them? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=106.08s)]
*  You don't get to know. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=107.08s)]
*  You don't get to learn about anything about Ashley Biden sharing with her father. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=108.08s)]
*  You can get arrested for that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=111.96s)]
*  You don't get to know how many FBI assets were in the crowd on January 6th and what [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=113.4s)]
*  they were doing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  As we just noted, you don't get to read the affidavit justifying the FBI's indefensible [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  raid on the home of Joe Biden's primary political opponent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=122.66000000000001s)]
*  In fact, you don't even get to know why you're not allowed to know because that information [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=126.0s)]
*  has been redacted too. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  What are you, a Russian agent? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  Stop asking. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=133.32s)]
*  Didn't used to be this way at all. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=134.32s)]
*  It's unrecognizable. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=137.24s)]
*  A lot has changed in a very short time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=138.94s)]
*  So it turns out, looking back 18 months, the 2020 election was the most consequential [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=141.72s)]
*  election of our lifetimes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=146.2s)]
*  You assume Joe Biden was incapacitated and couldn't change much. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=148.36s)]
*  Well, true, he is incapacitated, but the people behind him most definitely are not. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=151.96s)]
*  They are more ideological and more aggressive than ever. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=157.44s)]
*  Now it turns out among those people is our largest and most heavily armed federal law [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=162.32s)]
*  enforcement agency. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=166.92s)]
*  That would be the FBI. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=167.92s)]
*  The FBI is not allowed to insert itself into domestic politics. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=169.2s)]
*  That would violate the U.S. Constitution. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  It is completely illegal. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=175.56s)]
*  But for several years, it has become increasingly clear that that is exactly what the FBI is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=177.92s)]
*  doing, actively working on behalf of the Democratic Party, mocking the rule of law, subverting [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=181.92s)]
*  our democracy from within, far more effectively than any foreign government ever could. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=188.56s)]
*  If that sounds like an overheated claim, and it definitely does sound like an overheated [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=194.44s)]
*  claim, unfortunately, you should know it's entirely true. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=198.2s)]
*  We know that for a fact. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Here's how we know. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  And we learned it yesterday. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  Weeks before the 2020 election, the FBI pressured social media companies to kill the story of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=205.2s)]
*  Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=210.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=212.72s)]
*  Because that was a story that might have prevented Joe Biden from becoming president. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=213.72s)]
*  That happened. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=217.84s)]
*  And we know this not because the New York Times investigated it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=219.12s)]
*  They didn't bother. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=221.88s)]
*  They didn't bring you a special report in yesterday's paper giving you the details. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=222.88s)]
*  The New York Times would never do that, even if they knew it to be true. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  And they may. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=229.36s)]
*  No, we know this instead because Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook blithely admitted it almost parenthetically [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=230.36s)]
*  during an interview with Joe Rogan. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=237.68s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=239.56s)]
*  There was a lot of attention on Twitter during the election because of the Hunter Biden laptop [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=241.28s)]
*  story, the New York Post. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=247.24s)]
*  Yeah, we had that too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=248.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=249.24s)]
*  So you guys censored that as well? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=250.24s)]
*  So we took a different path than Twitter. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, basically, the background here is the FBI, I think, basically came to us, some [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=254.76s)]
*  folks on our team, it was like, hey, just so you know, like, you should be on high alert. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=259.92s)]
*  There was the we thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  We have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump of that's similar [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=270.0s)]
*  to that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=278.44s)]
*  So just be vigilant. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=279.44s)]
*  Oh, so Zuckerberg, just to be clear, you just saw it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=281.44s)]
*  But let's just unwind what we saw. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=286.24s)]
*  Zuckerberg was asked, why did you censor the story about Hunter Biden's laptop? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=288.2s)]
*  And he said some folks from the FBI came to us and indicated there was about to be a dump [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=293.8s)]
*  of Russian propaganda. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=300.2s)]
*  Now, there's some rewriting of history going on in which some are claiming, some at Facebook [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=301.2s)]
*  are claiming actually, that the visit from the FBI had nothing to do with the Hunter [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=306.36s)]
*  Biden laptop. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=310.88s)]
*  But the answer you just saw was in response to a question about the laptop and the censorship [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=311.88s)]
*  of it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=315.08s)]
*  And the answer was Russian propaganda, Russian disinformation. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=316.08s)]
*  Neither of those terms has an agreed upon meaning. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=319.24s)]
*  They don't actually mean anything. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=321.4s)]
*  What's Russian propaganda? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=323.4s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=325.0s)]
*  That should be the only question that any news or information company, including Facebook, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=326.44s)]
*  ever asked. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=331.32s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=332.32s)]
*  Truth is the defense. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=333.32s)]
*  No, it's Russian propaganda. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=335.24s)]
*  Again, a term without a meaning. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=336.52s)]
*  So we wanted to know more. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  We reached out to Mark Zuckerberg after that interview and he responded to us to his credit. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=341.0s)]
*  Zuckerberg confirmed that the FBI didn't put any of these warnings about Russian disinformation [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=344.96s)]
*  or propaganda in writing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=349.56s)]
*  Oh, of course they didn't. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=351.36s)]
*  Nothing in writing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=354.24s)]
*  And that makes sense. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=356.48s)]
*  If you're the FBI, you wouldn't want to put that in writing because you were of course [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=357.48s)]
*  lying. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=360.48s)]
*  At the moment the FBI was warning Facebook about a propaganda dump that obviously would [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=361.64000000000004s)]
*  include Hunter Biden's laptop, they had Hunter Biden's laptop in their possession. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=367.12s)]
*  So they knew perfectly well it was authentic. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=373.16s)]
*  As anyone who looks at it does, we have looked at it and it's instantly obvious this is real. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  And of course we now know conclusively it is real. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=380.16s)]
*  So that laptop was not censored because it was propaganda, whatever that means. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=383.56s)]
*  By the way, the FBI should never be in the information control business anyway. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=389.04s)]
*  It was censored because it might hurt Joe Biden. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=394.16s)]
*  And the FBI is the government agency that pushed for it to be censored. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=396.56s)]
*  Has that ever happened in the United States? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  Ever? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=407.8s)]
*  That is the definition of police state behavior. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=409.6s)]
*  A government agency independently decides it's going to determine the outcome of a supposedly [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=411.96s)]
*  democratic election. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=417.46s)]
*  So why is it nearly two years until we learn this? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=420.5s)]
*  Well it turns out Facebook is a very political place. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=426.46s)]
*  The founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, paid hundreds of millions of dollars to affect [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=429.78s)]
*  the outcome of the election, famously we've reported on that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  And then of course they were Democratic Party operatives working within Facebook. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=436.62s)]
*  So on October 14th, the Facebook communications official and former Democratic Party operative [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=440.85999999999996s)]
*  called Andy Stone, claimed that Facebook was censoring this story because of Facebook's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=444.54s)]
*  quote standard process to reduce the spread of misinformation, whatever that means. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=449.1s)]
*  But that was their initial explanation. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't until late October that Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of the company, publicly mentioned [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=455.86s)]
*  the FBI's involvement for the first time. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=460.70000000000005s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=462.42s)]
*  He testified to that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=469.42s)]
*  But at the time, Mark Zuckerberg didn't mention anything but the FBI warning Facebook about [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=471.26s)]
*  quote Russian propaganda specifically. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=476.18s)]
*  Why didn't he say anything? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=479.42s)]
*  That's odd because in October 2020, right before the election, weeks before a presidential [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  election, every media outlet in the country and then candidate Joe Biden himself were [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=486.58s)]
*  using the very same line. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=491.14s)]
*  It's Russian misinformation. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=494.02s)]
*  It's propaganda. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  And not surprisingly or coincidentally, dozens of quote former intelligence officials were [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=497.06s)]
*  saying the same thing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=503.34s)]
*  We can't play this enough. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=505.02s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=506.34s)]
*  When you look at this computer store owner in Delaware who allegedly received Hunter [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=508.18s)]
*  Biden's laptop, that is more in line with when you think about somebody who's a useful [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=513.42s)]
*  idiot. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=516.8199999999999s)]
*  That's kind of the entry point that is kind of again a classic indicator of the potential [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  presence of disinformation. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=523.22s)]
*  Right wing media has been focused on Hunter Biden. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=524.34s)]
*  This laptop that intelligence officials have warned is likely Russian disinformation. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=527.1800000000001s)]
*  Law enforcement is actively investigating whether the alleged Hunter Biden emails are [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=532.38s)]
*  linked to any foreign intel ops. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=536.78s)]
*  The story is preposterous. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=539.26s)]
*  So we're supposed to believe that Hunter Biden in a drunken stupor dropped off his laptop [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=540.6600000000001s)]
*  in I guess apparently QAnon repair office. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=546.82s)]
*  So those are just shills who will say whatever they're told to say. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=552.54s)]
*  Of course, no sober person would take them seriously. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=554.9399999999999s)]
*  And we missed the bigger story too. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=558.18s)]
*  We'll admit that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=559.9s)]
*  At the time, we imagined that this lie that the laptop was Russian misinformation was [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=560.9s)]
*  being pushed almost exclusively by Democratic partisans. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=566.38s)]
*  But that's not true. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=570.14s)]
*  It was much worse and much more threatening to our democracy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=572.3s)]
*  In fact, utterly corrosive of our democracy than that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=575.02s)]
*  Again, our media attributed these claims to former intel officials who wrote a letter [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=578.5799999999999s)]
*  about Russian disinformation. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=581.98s)]
*  But no, it wasn't just former intel officials spreading that lie. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=583.6999999999999s)]
*  It was members of the U.S. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=587.1s)]
*  government, federal bureaucrats, people who work for federal agencies, senior FBI leaders [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=589.18s)]
*  who are still at the FBI. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=594.74s)]
*  They lied and they knew they were lying. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=596.5s)]
*  And they never took steps to validate this claim that it was Russian propaganda or Russian [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=598.66s)]
*  disinformation. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=603.1s)]
*  On this show, in October of 2020, we interviewed one of Hunter Biden's business partners, a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=604.1s)]
*  And he verified the authenticity of that laptop. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=610.3s)]
*  He had firsthand information. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=614.5s)]
*  He had texts and emails that were on his phone and also on the laptop. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=615.62s)]
*  So we reached out to Tony Bobulinski last night and we asked him a very simple question. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=620.18s)]
*  Did anyone from the FBI ever call you or your lawyer to find out, since your name was all [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=625.3s)]
*  over the laptop, if those texts and emails were real? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=630.4599999999999s)]
*  If they wanted to know if this was Russian disinformation, they would, of course, call [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=634.5799999999999s)]
*  you. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=638.14s)]
*  But not one of them ever did. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=639.86s)]
*  They knew it wasn't Russian disinformation. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=642.6999999999999s)]
*  They knew it wasn't propaganda. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=644.26s)]
*  They knew it was completely real and they lied about it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=645.26s)]
*  Here's what Bobulinski told us in October of 2020. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=648.22s)]
*  On May 13th, that email was sent from James Gilear to me. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  I didn't generate that email. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=657.58s)]
*  James Gilear generated that email. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=659.46s)]
*  And in that email, James Gilear goes through intimate detail of what each individual's [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=661.9000000000001s)]
*  requests were from a compensation perspective and how the equity in the enterprise would [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=667.7800000000001s)]
*  be divvied up. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=673.5400000000001s)]
*  Very important. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=675.1400000000001s)]
*  May 13th, that email was generated by somebody else to me. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=676.1400000000001s)]
*  In that email, there's a statement where they go through the equity. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=680.38s)]
*  Jim Biden's referenced as 10%. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=685.1800000000001s)]
*  Doesn't say Biden, it says Jim. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=687.4200000000001s)]
*  And then it has 10% for the big guy held by H. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=690.18s)]
*  I thousand percent sit here and know that the big guy is referencing Joe Biden. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=693.66s)]
*  That's crystal clear to me because I lived it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=700.54s)]
*  I met with the former vice president in person multiple times and I had been meeting and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=702.5799999999999s)]
*  talking with Hunter Biden and Jim Biden and Rob Walker and James Gilear. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=708.18s)]
*  So to note the obvious, that's not some cable news mouth breather who's giving you his stupid [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=714.42s)]
*  partisan opinion about Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=719.18s)]
*  That's Hunter Biden's former business partner who can prove he was Hunter Biden's former [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=722.02s)]
*  business partner. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=725.9799999999999s)]
*  No one disputes he was Hunter Biden's former business partner. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=726.9799999999999s)]
*  His name, his emails or texts are all over the laptop. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=729.62s)]
*  And yet somehow the FBI, the agency that sent a dozen agents to investigate a rope in a [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=733.5s)]
*  NASCAR garage, the agency that used hundreds of agents to hunt down grandmothers from the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=737.9399999999999s)]
*  election justice protest on January 6th, that same agency couldn't spare a single agent [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=743.74s)]
*  to make a telephone call to Tony Bobolinski to ask questions about the laptop. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=748.38s)]
*  You claim it's propaganda, it's misinformation. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=754.34s)]
*  Why don't you call the guy who's on it and ask him? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=755.9s)]
*  They didn't bother. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=759.34s)]
*  This is what the FBI has become. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=761.18s)]
*  An agency that seeks to exert control over the information that you read in the media. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=763.9399999999999s)]
*  What is this? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=773.02s)]
*  Well, it's terrifying. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=774.02s)]
*  And again, this isn't speculation. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=775.78s)]
*  We just had it confirmed in public yesterday. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=777.5s)]
*  These are people whose main goal is to ensure that they never lose power in Washington, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=780.38s)]
*  interfering with our elections and not simply by hiding information, resorting to force [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=784.78s)]
*  because they know they can get away with it. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=790.88s)]
*  Joe Biden's chief political opponent right now, Biden says he's going to run again, Trump's [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=794.22s)]
*  indicated he's running again, would be Donald Trump. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=799.5s)]
*  And so they're targeting them. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=803.02s)]
*  Is anyone noticing this? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=804.74s)]
*  John Paul McIsaac, the computer repair shop owner who first obtained the laptop, says [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=806.86s)]
*  an FBI agent threatened him so he wouldn't go public with the laptop in case you've forgotten. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=811.66s)]
*  Watch. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=818.1s)]
*  The FBI met with me at my home and asked me about my concerns. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=819.62s)]
*  I voiced my concerns and they, I then shifted and said, hey, can I just want this out of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=824.9s)]
*  my shop at this point? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=831.7s)]
*  Just get it out of my shop and give me a phone number I can call. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=833.28s)]
*  Somebody come looking for it or wants to harass me about it. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=836.26s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, we can't do that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=840.02s)]
*  When they showed up, instead of bringing a tech guy with them, they brought a subpoena [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=841.5s)]
*  and they're like, yeah, we're just going to take everything. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=845.02s)]
*  I was a bit uncomfortable, a little nervous, but then excited at the same time. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=848.3s)]
*  So I kind of cracked a joke. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=851.9s)]
*  I said, don't worry, lads, when I, when I write the book, I'll leave your names out [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=852.9s)]
*  of this. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=857.14s)]
*  And that's when agent Mike turned around and said, oh, it's in our experience. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=858.14s)]
*  Nobody, nothing ever happens to people that talk about these things. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=861.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=866.0600000000001s)]
*  So in a free country, no one who obeys the law is afraid of law enforcement. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=867.0600000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=872.74s)]
*  No one should ever be afraid of the FBI, except people who know full well they've committed [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=873.74s)]
*  federal crimes, period. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=878.48s)]
*  But in this country, let's be honest, everybody's afraid of the FBI because you know exactly [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=880.02s)]
*  what happens to you if you tweak the nose of the FBI or if you annoy Joe Biden, you [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=884.48s)]
*  get raided, you get hauled into the street in leg irons, you get banned on social media [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=891.38s)]
*  as Jen Psaki said from the White House podium last year, quote, we're flagging problematic [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=894.7800000000001s)]
*  posts for Facebook. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=898.6600000000001s)]
*  Oh, so that's the White House, same administration, which oversees the FBI telling social media [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=899.6600000000001s)]
*  companies who's allowed to speak. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=906.7s)]
*  It happened to Alex Berenson. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=908.22s)]
*  It happened to Donald Trump. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=909.38s)]
*  Now we know what happened to the New York Post. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=910.62s)]
*  And the people running the FBI, people who did that, are still there. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=912.34s)]
*  This is a huge problem. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=916.86s)]
*  This cannot be ignored any longer. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=917.86s)]
*  Stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=924.7s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlc8EIrQxZc&t=927.5400000000001s)]
