# Tucker: These crimes are being abetted by the Biden admin and the media
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ)
*  So what should we think of the story? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, we should say at the outset [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=1.44s)]
*  that not every tragedy has obvious lessons. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=2.84s)]
*  We are hesitant to draw quick and dirty political conclusions, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=6.12s)]
*  particularly partisan ones, from something bad that happened. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=10.48s)]
*  Not every mudslide in Sri Lanka or cyclone in Ohio [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=13.08s)]
*  was the result of climate change. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=17.56s)]
*  Fair. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=19.48s)]
*  But it's still interesting to know a lot more [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=20.48s)]
*  about the man who apparently committed this crime, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=22.64s)]
*  Frank James. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=25.32s)]
*  Who was he? What did he think? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=26.44s)]
*  Well, it turns out that for years, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=28.16s)]
*  Frank James posted black supremacist rants [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=29.56s)]
*  on his YouTube channel for all to see. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=32.08s)]
*  Some of these videos date back to 2013 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=33.8s)]
*  and continue to very recently. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=36.36s)]
*  He uploaded within the last few days. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  Overnight, the journalist Andy Ngo [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=40.08s)]
*  unearthed a number of these posts. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=42.2s)]
*  You can go find them online. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=43.96s)]
*  We're not going to show them to you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=45.16s)]
*  But we want to read you some excerpts [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=46.72s)]
*  so you have some idea of what this man was thinking. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=49.08s)]
*  In one video he posted to YouTube, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=53.0s)]
*  James declares that, quote, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=54.76s)]
*  white people and black people, as we call ourselves, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=56.04s)]
*  should not have any contact with each other. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=58.32s)]
*  Blacks and whites, so-called, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=61.28s)]
*  should not even be in the same hemisphere. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=62.52s)]
*  James seemed especially enraged [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=65.68s)]
*  that Judge Ken Tangee Brown Jackson, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=67.48s)]
*  Joe Biden's Supreme Court pick, had married a white man. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=69.36s)]
*  Quote, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=72.32s)]
*  In other posts, James called for violence against people [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=80.44s)]
*  on the basis of their skin color. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  In one video, James says, for example, that, quote, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, I really want to kill them [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=88.32s)]
*  because they're white. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=90.16s)]
*  Pretty direct about his feelings on that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=93.0s)]
*  On Facebook, he posted a meme that said, quote, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  Oh, black Jesus, please kill all the whiteys. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  Why was he so angry? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, James explained that himself. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  Quote, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=104.35999999999999s)]
*  He'd seen that on CNN, and he believed it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  There were signs long before the shooting yesterday [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=112.0s)]
*  that James was dangerous, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  that he might act out against a white man. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=115.56s)]
*  He might act out against other people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=117.84s)]
*  In one instance, James filmed himself [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=119.92s)]
*  shouting racial epithets at people on the street. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=122.0s)]
*  Quote, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=124.48s)]
*  And to throw that in for good luck, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't listen to you, white racist MFer. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=130.4s)]
*  They do exist. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=132.8s)]
*  They do effing exist. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  We could go on and on and on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=135.16s)]
*  He attacks Asians, too. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=136.72s)]
*  Disgusting. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=138.76s)]
*  So this guy was a racist. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=140.24s)]
*  He was not a white supremacist. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=141.84s)]
*  And that might surprise you because Joe Biden [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=144.2s)]
*  including the attorney general and the head of DHS [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=148.12s)]
*  have told us again and again and again, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=150.52s)]
*  and the New York Times has confirmed this again [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  and again and again, that white supremacists, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=154.44s)]
*  right-wing Trump voters, are the number one terror threat [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=157.68s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=161.08s)]
*  Here's Biden. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=162.88s)]
*  We must confront and defeat political extremism, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=164.72s)]
*  white supremacy, and domestic terrorism. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=168.0s)]
*  White supremacy, domestic terrorism, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=170.72s)]
*  that we must confront and we will defeat. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=174.0s)]
*  According to the United States intelligence community, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=177.56s)]
*  domestic terrorism from white supremacists [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=179.48s)]
*  is the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=182.2s)]
*  What a liar he is. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=187.24s)]
*  Yeah, there are racists of all colors in this country, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=188.44s)]
*  but white supremacy is not the main threat we face. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=190.32s)]
*  Racial animus of all kinds is not the main threat we face. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=193.0s)]
*  And in fact, since Joe Biden took office, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=195.6s)]
*  there has not been a single deadly attack [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=197.16s)]
*  by a white supremacist or a QAnon shaman. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=199.2s)]
*  At the same time, since Joe Biden took office, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=202.08s)]
*  a BLM supporter rammed his car into a barricade [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=203.88s)]
*  at the Capitol and murdered a police officer. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=206.24s)]
*  Then another BLM supporter ran over dozens of people, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=208.4s)]
*  including children, at a Christmas parade in Wisconsin [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=210.56s)]
*  in Waukesha, killing six people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=212.6s)]
*  Many more were maimed. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=214.56s)]
*  Most recently, a BLM supporter, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=215.84s)]
*  and by the way, an honoree of the Barack Obama Foundation, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=217.6s)]
*  tried to assassinate a mayoral candidate in Kentucky. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=219.96s)]
*  Again, most people who commit acts of violence like this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  are mentally ill. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=226.2s)]
*  So there isn't always an obvious political lesson. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=227.96s)]
*  But if you take three steps back, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=230.52s)]
*  maybe if the entire news media tells you every day [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=232.36s)]
*  of your life that America hates you [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  because of your skin color, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=236.56s)]
*  you might respond to that at a certain point. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  Why wouldn't you? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  Why wouldn't we see more crimes like this? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  They're being abetted and effectively encouraged [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=245.36s)]
*  by the Biden administration and the American news media, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=248.8s)]
*  obviously, and it's bad for everybody of all colors. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=251.68s)]
*  Showing race hatred, suspicion, anxiety, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=255.8s)]
*  is terrible for the country, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=259.72s)]
*  and they're doing it every single day. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2woeFwwwgQ&t=260.92s)]
