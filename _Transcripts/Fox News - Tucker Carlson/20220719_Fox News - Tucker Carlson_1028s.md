# Tucker Carlson: Nothing like this has ever happened
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, looking back, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=2.12s)]
*  the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  turned out to be one of the most significant pieces [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=6.92s)]
*  of legislation ever passed by the US Congress. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=9.08s)]
*  Now, the people who wrote it knew that it would be, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=11.84s)]
*  so naturally they spent a lot of time [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=14.16s)]
*  trying to convince everyone else [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=15.96s)]
*  that in fact it was no big deal. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=17.14s)]
*  "'This is not a revolutionary bill,' [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=18.84s)]
*  assured Lyndon Johnson when he signed it, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  the first tip that it was in fact a revolutionary bill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=23.96s)]
*  And then there was this, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=27.0s)]
*  on the Senate floor, Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=27.84s)]
*  the man who drove the bill, went out of his way [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=29.88s)]
*  to explain that the Democratic Party [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=32.48s)]
*  was absolutely not trying to replace [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  the American population [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=36.12s)]
*  with more compliant foreign-born voters. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=37.56s)]
*  No way, that's an insane conspiracy theory,' he explained. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=40.16s)]
*  Quote, "'This bill will not flood our cities [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  with immigrants,' Kennedy said. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=47.72s)]
*  "'It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=49.32s)]
*  It will not relax the standards of admission. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=52.0s)]
*  It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.'" [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=54.76s)]
*  Hey, it's all bitterly amusing when you look back at it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=58.48s)]
*  because of course that is precisely what this bill did. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=62.8s)]
*  This bill changed America completely and forever. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=65.32s)]
*  And the numbers show it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=68.32s)]
*  In the years since that legislation passed, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=69.64s)]
*  the United States total population [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=72.36s)]
*  exploded by 140 million people. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=74.12s)]
*  You're seeing that chart on your screen right now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=77.36s)]
*  What direction is it pointing? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=79.69999999999999s)]
*  Well, steadily upward, that's the population. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  Now, where did all those people come from? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=83.16s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with more people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  The question is, who are they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=85.97999999999999s)]
*  and where do they come from? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=88.08s)]
*  Well, what you're seeing is not the kind of organic growth [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=89.0s)]
*  that you would see in a healthy society [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=92.24s)]
*  that's become more prosperous and welcoming of families. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=94.16s)]
*  It's not like people were so confident in the future [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=97.28s)]
*  they decided to have more kids. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=99.24s)]
*  No, it's just the opposite, exactly the opposite of that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  In fact, since Ted Kennedy's bill became law, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=103.5s)]
*  birth rates among native-born Americans, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=106.68s)]
*  which are the clearest possible measure of optimism [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=109.32s)]
*  in the future, those have dropped off a cliff. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=112.36s)]
*  And you're seeing that chart on the screen now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=115.12s)]
*  It's the inverse of the first chart. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=117.0s)]
*  This chart points downward. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=118.56s)]
*  In 2020, the most recent year for which we have data, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=121.08s)]
*  the overall fertility rate in the United States [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=123.92s)]
*  hit the lowest point ever recorded, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=126.08s)]
*  and that was before COVID. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=127.88s)]
*  This country is now well under [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=130.92s)]
*  the so-called replacement level. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=132.24s)]
*  That means if we continue on this trajectory [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=133.96s)]
*  and no one's trying to take us off this trajectory, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=135.8s)]
*  eventually there'll be no more native-born Americans. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=138.04s)]
*  So you put these two graphs together [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=142.2s)]
*  and what do they show you? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=143.68s)]
*  Well, they show you a number of things, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=144.72s)]
*  but here's the main one. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=145.9s)]
*  Sometime around 1965, our leaders stopped trying to make [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=147.22s)]
*  the United States a hospitable place for American citizens, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=151.46s)]
*  their constituents, to have their own families. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=154.66s)]
*  That used to be considered the central task of leadership, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=157.82s)]
*  perpetuating the population. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=161.82s)]
*  If people are happy and confident, they'll have kids. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  They're vested in the society, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  and if they're not, they won't. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=169.18s)]
*  That was their job. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  So they stopped doing it, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=172.4s)]
*  and instead they just imported new people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=173.5s)]
*  That's literally what happened. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  Now, you're not allowed to point this out, of course. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  The media become absolutely hysterical when you do, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=180.42s)]
*  because it's so obviously true. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=182.5s)]
*  What's interesting is that if something like this happened [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=185.54s)]
*  in any other country, say in China or Japan or Nigeria, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=187.5s)]
*  the populations of those countries would likely revolt, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=191.5s)]
*  because you can't do that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=194.62s)]
*  The leaders of a country can't change the population [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=196.9s)]
*  of the country, especially in the democracy, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  without the consent of the existing population. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=201.78s)]
*  So if the populations in, say, Nigeria, for example, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=206.66s)]
*  revolted, the New York Times should be deeply sympathetic [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=208.46s)]
*  to their outrage. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=210.5s)]
*  Again, you can't just replace the electorate [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=211.34s)]
*  because you didn't like the last election outcomes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  That would be the definition of undermining democracy, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  changing the voters. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  But when it happens in this country, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=222.9s)]
*  there is mandatory media-enforced silence. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=224.86s)]
*  And in fact, if you notice it's happening, it's your fault. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=228.38s)]
*  You're immoral, you're a racist. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  It's about change, and it's absolutely real. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=234.98s)]
*  The majority of population growth since 1965 [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=237.98s)]
*  has come from immigration, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=240.66s)]
*  not from Americans having more kids. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=242.26s)]
*  In 1965, the number of permanent illegal migrants [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=244.38s)]
*  in this country from Latin America was essentially zero. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=247.22s)]
*  They were migrant farm workers, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=249.94s)]
*  but there were no huge populations, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=251.1s)]
*  people living there illegally. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=252.42s)]
*  By 2008, that number had grown to perhaps 20 million people. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=254.38s)]
*  They lied about it, but the best estimates suggest [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=259.58s)]
*  it was tens of millions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=262.54s)]
*  And then came Joe Biden. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden accelerated that sad trend [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=267.18s)]
*  beyond what anyone thought was possible. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=269.82s)]
*  The foreign-born population is now growing [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=273.26000000000005s)]
*  by 132,000 people every month. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  That's more than triple the average high [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=280.3s)]
*  under previous administrations. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=282.1s)]
*  It's double Barack Obama's highest totals. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=283.38s)]
*  According to AI scholar Mark Perry, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=286.38s)]
*  we can expect over 9 million new illegal aliens [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=287.98s)]
*  by the end of Joe Biden's first term. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=291.62s)]
*  Nothing like this has ever happened [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=295.98s)]
*  in this or maybe any other country ever. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=297.9s)]
*  And it's happening for one reason. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=300.66s)]
*  It's not natural, it's the product of a policy choice. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=302.7s)]
*  Joe Biden promised amnesty [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=305.22s)]
*  to anyone who makes it across our border. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=306.7s)]
*  So in 2019, for example, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=309.18s)]
*  the Trump administration criminally prosecuted [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=311.22s)]
*  110,000 illegal migrants for violating immigration law. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=313.46s)]
*  Not that they were bad people, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=317.3s)]
*  some of them were great people, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=318.38s)]
*  but you're not allowed to go into someone else's country [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=319.82s)]
*  without permission. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=321.78s)]
*  That's what a law is. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=322.98s)]
*  And if you ignore the law, you are no longer a real country. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=324.78s)]
*  You're something less than that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=328.94s)]
*  You're a failed state. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=329.94s)]
*  So you have to enforce the law, including immigration law. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=331.54s)]
*  But Joe Biden stopped doing it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=335.82s)]
*  Last year, Joe Biden prosecuted fewer than 3,000 total. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=337.58s)]
*  That's according to DHS data [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=341.94s)]
*  obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=343.46s)]
*  It's a drop of nearly 98%. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=344.78s)]
*  So naturally, people are coming [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=347.22s)]
*  because why wouldn't you wanna move to the United States? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=350.7s)]
*  Knowing that when you get here, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=354.74s)]
*  you will be treated like someone who deserves to be here [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=356.38s)]
*  and given every possible public benefit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=360.22s)]
*  You'd be crazy not to come. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=362.42s)]
*  And so they are in massive numbers [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  and then traveling often at public expense [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=366.26s)]
*  paid for by you without your knowledge [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=368.3s)]
*  throughout the United States. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=369.98s)]
*  Watts One border agent explained what exactly is happening. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  DPS officers have been assisting border patrol [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=375.26000000000005s)]
*  under Operation Lone Star for 16 months. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=378.3s)]
*  In that time, they've apprehended 279,000 [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=381.5s)]
*  undocumented migrants, arrested 17,000 criminals [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=385.3s)]
*  and seized nearly 320 million lethal doses of fentanyl. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=389.5s)]
*  Every state has become a border state [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=394.74s)]
*  because all these individuals that are coming across, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=396.42s)]
*  aside from the families, the single adults, the Godaways, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=398.94000000000005s)]
*  the drugs that are coming in are going to other states. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=402.1s)]
*  They're not staying in Texas. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=404.62s)]
*  That's Mexico there, so they'll come across. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=405.9s)]
*  They'll bring them across on a raft. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=407.3s)]
*  They usually have 30, 40 immigrants on these rafts [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=408.66s)]
*  as they're bringing them across. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=411.66s)]
*  They know where to drop them off [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=412.62s)]
*  and they know where to walk. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=413.74s)]
*  So here's another thing that's changed since 1965, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=415.86s)]
*  along with our population. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=418.5s)]
*  Politicians no longer feel they need to pretend, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=420.9s)]
*  partly because the population is so different. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=424.3s)]
*  You've got a lot more people [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=427.02s)]
*  with permanent jobs in American politics. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=428.1s)]
*  So unlike Lyndon Johnson, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=431.18s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't pretend that his goal [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=432.58s)]
*  was not to change the population. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=436.02s)]
*  He said it out loud. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=437.82s)]
*  During the campaign, Biden referred to illegal immigration [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=439.06s)]
*  as a gift. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=442.26s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=443.18s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=444.09999999999997s)]
*  They're the reason why. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=445.21999999999997s)]
*  The legal as well as undocumented [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=446.86s)]
*  are the reason why our society is functioning, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=449.29999999999995s)]
*  the reason why our economy is growing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=451.86s)]
*  We don't talk about that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=453.74s)]
*  We stand up and act like it's a burden. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=455.26s)]
*  It is not a burden. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=457.38s)]
*  It's a gift. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=458.97999999999996s)]
*  It's a gift, says a man who has worked in a public job [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=460.9s)]
*  his entire life, who's never had a real job ever, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=464.78s)]
*  is lecturing you about the economy [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=469.21999999999997s)]
*  and how it works as if he knows. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=471.3s)]
*  By the way, in that tape, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=473.58s)]
*  Joe Biden was so senile that his wife and his handlers [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=475.3s)]
*  gave him drugs before that interview, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=479.54s)]
*  that interview that you just saw. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=481.26s)]
*  So that's the guy telling you [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=482.54s)]
*  about the economic benefits of illegal immigration. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=484.26s)]
*  Now, mostly you're not supposed to notice [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=489.42s)]
*  that that conversation even took place, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  just like you're not supposed to notice [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=492.66s)]
*  when the New York Times prints an op-ed called, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=493.86s)]
*  We Can Replace Them, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  because that's a dangerous conspiracy theory. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=498.42s)]
*  What are you, Alex Jones? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=501.1s)]
*  No, we just watch carefully. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=503.06s)]
*  Not even that carefully. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=505.86s)]
*  They say it constantly. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=506.70000000000005s)]
*  The Great Replacement? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=509.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a conspiracy theory. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=511.54s)]
*  It's their electoral strategy, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=513.82s)]
*  and we know that because they say it all the time. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  Here's some examples. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=518.98s)]
*  Blue Wave is African-American. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=521.82s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=524.1800000000001s)]
*  It's white, it's Latino, it's Asian Pacific Islander. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=525.86s)]
*  It is made up of those who've been told [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=528.62s)]
*  that they are not worthy of being here. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=530.5s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=532.38s)]
*  It is comprised of those [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=533.38s)]
*  who are documented and undocumented. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=534.4200000000001s)]
*  In a couple of presidential cycles, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=536.34s)]
*  you'll be on election night, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=538.0600000000001s)]
*  you'll be announcing that we're calling [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=539.74s)]
*  the 38 electoral votes of Texas [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=541.38s)]
*  for the Democratic nominee for president. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=543.46s)]
*  It's changing, it's gonna become a purple state [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=545.7s)]
*  and then a blue state because of the demographics. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=548.1s)]
*  The demographics of America [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=550.58s)]
*  are not on the side of the Republican Party. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=552.14s)]
*  The new voters in this country are moving away from them. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=555.38s)]
*  And instead, they're moving to be independents [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=559.26s)]
*  or to even vote on the other side. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=562.38s)]
*  An unrelenting stream of immigration. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=564.3000000000001s)]
*  Non-stop, non-stop. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=567.46s)]
*  Folks like me who were Caucasian of European descent, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=571.46s)]
*  for the first time in 2017, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=575.98s)]
*  will be in an absolute minority [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=578.1400000000001s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=580.58s)]
*  Absolute minority. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=582.6600000000001s)]
*  Fewer than 50% of the people in America, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=584.62s)]
*  from then and on, will be white European stock. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=587.46s)]
*  That's not a bad thing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=592.94s)]
*  That's a source of our strength. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=594.5400000000001s)]
*  So, how is that a source of our strength? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=598.5s)]
*  He never explained. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=600.62s)]
*  So, clearly it's a source of the Democratic Party's strength [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=602.9000000000001s)]
*  because they believe, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=606.6600000000001s)]
*  though actually that plan might not work out for them [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=608.0600000000001s)]
*  since a lot of the people arriving [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=610.0600000000001s)]
*  may not be sympathetic to Joe Biden, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=611.4200000000001s)]
*  who possibly could be. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=612.82s)]
*  But electoral politics are really secondary [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=614.58s)]
*  to the real concern, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=618.0200000000001s)]
*  which is the stability of the country. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=619.6600000000001s)]
*  So, the problem with what the Democratic Party [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=622.74s)]
*  is doing right now is not simply [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=624.4200000000001s)]
*  that it helps the Democratic Party, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=625.98s)]
*  though we think that's bad. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=627.22s)]
*  The problem is that they're doing it way too fast. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=628.82s)]
*  So, we need to change at once. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=632.3s)]
*  For any society, ever, at any point in history, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=633.9s)]
*  no society can metabolize this many new people [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=637.22s)]
*  and stay stable, especially not now, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=641.14s)]
*  in this specific moment. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  Because two unprecedented waves of human migration, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=645.62s)]
*  you have to add, let's see, a collapsing economy, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=648.86s)]
*  inflation, food shortages, skyrocketing housing prices, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=652.22s)]
*  falling wages, the trauma of two and a half years of COVID, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=655.9399999999999s)]
*  the manufactured racial strife. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=659.1s)]
*  You saw Joe Biden himself encouraging. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=660.86s)]
*  You put all that together, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=664.02s)]
*  and you have the most volatile possible mix [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=665.0600000000001s)]
*  of social factors. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=668.34s)]
*  So, into that, you throw millions of brand new people [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=670.1s)]
*  who have no connection to America whatsoever, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=672.86s)]
*  people who broke our laws to get here, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=675.74s)]
*  who don't speak our language, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=677.94s)]
*  who have no idea what the US Constitution says [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=679.5s)]
*  and don't care. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=682.26s)]
*  And what do you have when you put all of that together? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=684.7s)]
*  You have a recipe for social collapse. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=687.0600000000001s)]
*  This is why no sane government would ever do this. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=690.5s)]
*  The Chinese government would never consider doing this. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=693.5400000000001s)]
*  Even corrupt, dumb governments [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=696.62s)]
*  that can't even keep a national airline flying [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=698.7s)]
*  would never do something like this to their own countries [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=701.5s)]
*  because they don't want their own countries to collapse. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=703.82s)]
*  And it's not an attack on the people coming here, by the way, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  some of whom are legitimately great people [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=709.62s)]
*  and wanna be here for the right reasons. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=712.22s)]
*  The problem is the volume. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=714.9000000000001s)]
*  No country can withstand what we're going through right now. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=716.5400000000001s)]
*  And in our specific case, it turns out [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=720.02s)]
*  that a lot of the people coming [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=722.38s)]
*  are not ready to participate in a democracy. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=723.78s)]
*  A huge percentage of the migrants crossing the border today [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=727.02s)]
*  are functionally illiterate. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=729.26s)]
*  According to the Center for Immigration Studies, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=730.8199999999999s)]
*  41% of the immigrants score at or below [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=732.66s)]
*  the lowest level of English literacy, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=735.38s)]
*  a level variously described as below basic [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=737.8199999999999s)]
*  or functionally illiterate. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=739.98s)]
*  Now add to this the problems that American-born people [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=742.62s)]
*  are having with English after two years of COVID [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=746.62s)]
*  and suspended education [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=749.58s)]
*  and a life spent staring into a screen. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=751.98s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=755.1s)]
*  A lot of people who are moving here [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=756.7s)]
*  are not becoming assimilated. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=758.3000000000001s)]
*  And we know that because many haven't learned English [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=760.0600000000001s)]
*  after living here for years. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=762.38s)]
*  The same study found that 67% of Hispanic immigrants [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=764.26s)]
*  do not develop English proficiency [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=768.38s)]
*  even after 15 years of living in the United States. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=770.5s)]
*  That means around 5 million migrants became citizens [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=772.7800000000001s)]
*  without even being able to speak our language. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=775.9s)]
*  Once again, not an attack on them, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=780.18s)]
*  an attack on the people running the country. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=782.9s)]
*  This could capsize the United States. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=786.5s)]
*  This is a huge sprawling country with a massive population. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=788.74s)]
*  So the question from day one has always been, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=791.5799999999999s)]
*  what holds everyone together? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=794.74s)]
*  What is the one thing we all have in common? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=796.66s)]
*  It's not an ethnic group, it's not a shared history. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=798.34s)]
*  Now it's not a language, so what is it? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=801.26s)]
*  Well, in the absence of glue, things break apart. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=803.66s)]
*  That's a physical principle. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=806.86s)]
*  So no one who cared about the future of this country [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=808.8199999999999s)]
*  would do this to the country. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=811.18s)]
*  It is truly insanity. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=812.4599999999999s)]
*  And yet the Biden administration is trying to make it worse, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=814.4599999999999s)]
*  working hard to make it worse. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=817.98s)]
*  Fox News is reporting tonight [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=819.9399999999999s)]
*  that the administration awarded $172 million grand [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=821.14s)]
*  to a George Soros-linked organization, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=825.42s)]
*  which exists to quote, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=827.66s)]
*  help young border crossers avoid deportation. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  Now, why is some foreign born billionaire [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=833.14s)]
*  allowed to change our country fundamentally? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=836.3s)]
*  That's the big question. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=838.62s)]
*  Here are the specifics. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=840.26s)]
*  This organization is called the Vera Institute for Justice, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=841.34s)]
*  and it stands to gain a billion dollars in federal money [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=843.74s)]
*  by the end of the contract, just to subvert our laws. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=846.78s)]
*  Now the catch is that no one verifies [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=850.22s)]
*  whether the people crossing the border are actually miners. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=851.98s)]
*  You can't know who they are. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=856.02s)]
*  By definition, they're here illegally. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=857.86s)]
*  And after 9-11, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=860.1s)]
*  didn't we care about the authenticity of documents? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=861.38s)]
*  Didn't we have a real ID act? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=863.8199999999999s)]
*  But we don't know how old they are. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=867.42s)]
*  And that's how 24-year-old Medina Yuloa [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=868.9s)]
*  was able to enter this country [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=871.18s)]
*  and murder a father of four in the backyard [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=872.42s)]
*  of his house in Florida in October. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=875.1s)]
*  He posed as a child so that Joe Biden [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=876.5799999999999s)]
*  would fly him at your expense to Jacksonville [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=878.8199999999999s)]
*  in the middle of the night. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=880.9399999999999s)]
*  So courtesy of the Biden administration, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=882.42s)]
*  unaccompanied miners like Medina Yuloa [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=884.1s)]
*  are also arriving in New York, in Texas, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=886.38s)]
*  Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arizona, and many other places. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=889.78s)]
*  According, for example, to 12 News in Phoenix, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=893.34s)]
*  the representatives for Phoenix Sky Harbor [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=895.34s)]
*  International Airport reported that hundreds of migrants [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=897.02s)]
*  showed up recently with no booked tickets. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=899.38s)]
*  Roughly 300 to 400 refugees have arrived [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=902.5799999999999s)]
*  every single day by bus in recent months. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=904.78s)]
*  So why are all of these illegal aliens arriving in Phoenix? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=907.78s)]
*  Well, many of them are dropped off [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=912.1s)]
*  by a nonprofit called RCBH, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=913.26s)]
*  which brags it's helped nearly 20,000 illegal aliens [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=916.78s)]
*  released by immigration authorities without charges, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=920.06s)]
*  moving all over the country. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=923.06s)]
*  And that's where it's happening, all over the country. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=924.22s)]
*  In Brownsville, Texas, Fox News observed buses [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=926.6999999999999s)]
*  contracted by the Biden administration [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=929.06s)]
*  dropping off dozens of male migrants at a parking garage. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=930.9s)]
*  Our reporters witnessed those migrants [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=934.62s)]
*  go into an unmarked office, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=936.22s)]
*  then get picked up by taxi cabs and driven to the airport. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=938.06s)]
*  None of them were children. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=940.8199999999999s)]
*  Commercial airline pilots right now [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=943.06s)]
*  are being told to fly these people all over the country. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=944.62s)]
*  We spoke to a pilot who's doing it every day, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=947.14s)]
*  and we're quoting, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=949.0200000000001s)]
*  "'We are breaking the law, transporting illegals, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=949.86s)]
*  many of whom are unaccompanied minors.'" [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=952.26s)]
*  Why is this continuing? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=955.5400000000001s)]
*  Because neither party is interested in stopping it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=957.14s)]
*  On this question, as on foreign policy, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=960.38s)]
*  there's only one party, the Uniparty, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=962.7s)]
*  and it's aligned against your most basic interests, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=964.46s)]
*  no matter what color you are, by the way. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=966.94s)]
*  Instead, both parties are finding new ways [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=970.22s)]
*  to give American jobs to foreign-born applicants. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=972.34s)]
*  62 Republicans just joined to their eternal shame [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=975.1800000000001s)]
*  with almost every single Democrat in the House [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=978.0600000000001s)]
*  to pass the National Defense Bill. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=980.26s)]
*  Now, tucked away in that $840 billion piece of legislation [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=982.02s)]
*  is a plan to give away even more American jobs [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=986.22s)]
*  to foreign workers, as if we need this now. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=988.7s)]
*  So now the children of H-1B visa workers [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=991.0600000000001s)]
*  will receive citizenship [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=993.1800000000001s)]
*  because their parents took jobs in this country? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=994.98s)]
*  How does that work exactly? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=998.22s)]
*  Shut up, racist! [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=999.5s)]
*  Again, it's not about race. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=1002.0600000000001s)]
*  It's about economics and social cohesion, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=1003.22s)]
*  both of which they're destroying. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=1005.9s)]
*  Now, according to our Congress, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6TDCFr9UY&t=1007.1800000000001s)]
