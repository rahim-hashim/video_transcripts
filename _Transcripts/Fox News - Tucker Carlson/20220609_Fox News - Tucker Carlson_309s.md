# Tulsi Gabbard slams the Jan 6 hearings: It's 'political interest'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8)
*  Tulsi Gabbard is a former member of Congress from Hawaii, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=0.0s)]
*  ran for president last cycle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=2.88s)]
*  She joins us tonight with her assessment. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=7.0s)]
*  So given everything the country faces right now, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=9.1s)]
*  both domestically and abroad, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=12.6s)]
*  why are the news networks colluding with a political party [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=15.36s)]
*  to tell us this is the most important thing? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=19.52s)]
*  Because whether you're talking about the mainstream media [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=22.64s)]
*  or you're talking about Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=25.12s)]
*  or Congress, frankly, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=27.72s)]
*  they don't carry, they don't care about the real threats [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=29.84s)]
*  that we face domestically to our freedoms and our democracy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=33.4s)]
*  So instead they're focusing on this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=37.64s)]
*  They don't wanna deal with the real issues [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=39.3s)]
*  that Americans are struggling with every day [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=40.6s)]
*  across the country, increasing inflation, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=43.38s)]
*  rising gas prices, increasing crime, open borders. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=46.28s)]
*  The list goes on and on about the very real domestic issues [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  that we face. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=54.96s)]
*  And frankly, they've abdicated [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=55.8s)]
*  on their most important responsibility in Congress. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  The one that constitution says only Congress has, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=61.4s)]
*  which is the power to declare war or not. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=63.68s)]
*  So, you've talked about this Tucker, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=66.64s)]
*  we just saw how Congress rushed through [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=68.6s)]
*  this additional funding bill of $40 billion [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=70.64s)]
*  towards this war in Ukraine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=74.08s)]
*  We are not only in a cold war with Russia, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=76.08s)]
*  we are in a hot war with Russia, with Ukraine as the proxy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=78.84s)]
*  And there was no serious debate whatsoever [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=82.6s)]
*  about really what the consequences of this bill would be. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=86.12s)]
*  And frankly, whether or not we should even be [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=88.28s)]
*  in a war with Russia or frankly, any other country. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  So this goes back to what are their priorities. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Every member of Congress takes an oath of office [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=97.48s)]
*  and swears to support and defend the constitution [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=103.16s)]
*  Well, the constitution provides all of us [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=104.56s)]
*  with very specific rights and freedoms [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=106.68s)]
*  enshrined in that constitution. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=110.04s)]
*  Right now we've got the Biden administration, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=112.4s)]
*  we've got the Department of Justice, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=114.36s)]
*  the mainstream media, big tech, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  all colluding to undermine our rights [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=117.4s)]
*  and civil liberties and freedoms. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=120.4s)]
*  I don't see Congress taking action to address [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=123.24s)]
*  and deal with that threat. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=126.08s)]
*  So if they really wanted to uphold their oath [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=127.2s)]
*  that they swore, that's exactly what they [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=129.08s)]
*  should be focused on right now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=131.64s)]
*  I think the most disturbing moment [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=133.88s)]
*  a year and a half later looking back [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=136.4s)]
*  is the moment where Lindsey Graham turned [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=138.44s)]
*  to the Capitol police and said, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=140.44s)]
*  you have guns, use them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=141.6s)]
*  They had just shot an unarmed military veteran to death, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=142.88s)]
*  who stood about five feet tall. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=146.12s)]
*  And I guess what bothers me the most is that nobody cared. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=148.0s)]
*  I mean, police take life, often it's justified, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=150.92s)]
*  we've defended it on this show, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=154.0s)]
*  but to not investigate it or explain it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  suggests that the life that was taken was worth nothing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=158.16s)]
*  And that is the message that they're sending. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=161.76s)]
*  This woman's life didn't mean anything. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=163.44s)]
*  It wasn't, we just killed her and threw her away. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=165.28s)]
*  I mean, how can members of Congress sit there [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=167.44s)]
*  and allow that? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=169.2s)]
*  Members of Congress are not, again, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=171.08s)]
*  they don't have their priorities straight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=173.12s)]
*  So much of this has been politicized, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=175.44000000000003s)]
*  it's been sensationalized with very specific objectives [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  that have nothing to do with upholding the Constitution [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  or what's in the best interest of the country [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  and the American people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  And I think the way that this hearing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=188.4s)]
*  has been actually not even so-called produced, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=190.84s)]
*  it's literally being produced by somebody [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=194.12s)]
*  I think who is from ABC News in order [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  to try to come with an out, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  with an objective that has nothing to do again [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=201.48s)]
*  with what's best for the people, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=203.76s)]
*  what's best for the Constitution. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=205.32s)]
*  They're trying to achieve their own political interests. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  And it's just really sad that they're abusing their power [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  in order to do that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=213.08s)]
*  This is the kind of propaganda show [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=214.36s)]
*  that we used to make fun of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  when it took place in totalitarian, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=217.04s)]
*  when you were a kid, you remember that? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=218.72s)]
*  I mean, we had this vibrant, lively news media [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=220.0s)]
*  and people debated things [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=222.8s)]
*  and we'd look over at these totalitarian hellholes [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=223.88s)]
*  and say, they turn on their TVs [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=226.12s)]
*  and they get this pre-produced lying. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=227.92s)]
*  How shocking is this? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=231.44s)]
*  This is not America and this is what's so crazy [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  and what's angering and sad, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  all of these things at the same time is, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=238.64s)]
*  this is not the vision that our founders had for America [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=240.48s)]
*  and these people who serve in the people's house, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=244.32s)]
*  members of Congress literally go to work every day [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=247.72s)]
*  in the people's house. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  And it just seems like so many of them have forgotten [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=252.48s)]
*  that that's who they work for, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=255.0s)]
*  that it's such a privilege to have that responsibility. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=257.04s)]
*  I'm grateful to have had it [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=259.76s)]
*  and to see them going every day [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=261.68s)]
*  and abusing that privilege, abusing that responsibility [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=263.8s)]
*  and not at all focused on what's in the best interest [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=266.92s)]
*  of the people should be concerning [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=269.04s)]
*  for every American across country [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=271.64s)]
*  and that's why we have elections. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=273.48s)]
*  We have the opportunity to fire those [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=275.12s)]
*  who are not putting the American people [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=278.12s)]
*  in our country first. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=280.12s)]
*  I think this every time we talk, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=281.6s)]
*  you were one of the most temperamentally moderate [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=282.8s)]
*  and sensible and even-killed people I've ever talked to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=285.0s)]
*  and you were considered a radical in the Congress. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=288.12s)]
*  It just tells you everything about them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=291.0s)]
*  We're always grateful when you're on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=293.24s)]
*  Chelsea Gabbard, thank you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=294.6s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwciEh9owo8&t=298.48s)]
