# Washington Mayor Bowser slammed for apparent flip-flop on sanctuary city status
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8)
*  Like most big city mayors, Muriel Bowser of Washington, DC, has made life for her own [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=0.0s)]
*  residents much, much worse over the past couple of years. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=6.3s)]
*  But at the same time, she's shown great concern for illegal aliens coming here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=9.38s)]
*  She declared Washington, DC a sanctuary city. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=13.38s)]
*  She said the city would pay to fight the federal government's efforts to deport people. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=15.74s)]
*  She said the city would give illegal aliens free housing, healthcare, education. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Well, why wouldn't people from around the world take Muriel Bowser up on her offer? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=25.18s)]
*  Well, they have, and they've moved there in huge numbers. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=30.18s)]
*  That's a win for diversity, right? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=33.62s)]
*  No. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=35.18s)]
*  Turns out Muriel Bowser is, and we don't use this phrase lightly, a white supremacist, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=36.18s)]
*  maybe even a white nationalist. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=40.26s)]
*  She's claiming this new diversity in Washington, DC is a humanitarian crisis, and she's such [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=42.42s)]
*  a racist, she wants the army to come. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=48.08s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=51.18s)]
*  I've asked for the deployment of the Guard, as long as we need the Guard to deal with [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=52.18s)]
*  the humanitarian crisis, that we expect to escalate. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=56.74s)]
*  The number of people crossing the border seeking asylum, we expect to only go up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=61.5s)]
*  And we need to make sure that there is a national response. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=68.62s)]
*  Chip Roy is a congressman from Texas who's been to the border numerous times. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=73.26s)]
*  We're happy to talk to him tonight. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=77.1s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=78.5s)]
*  So we're obviously making fun of Muriel Bowser, who's one of the most incompetent people ever [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=80.18s)]
*  to hold public office in this country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=83.14s)]
*  On the other hand, she is calling out the National Guard to deal with illegal aliens. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  Why aren't the governors of real states doing that, actually, now that I think about it? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=89.18s)]
*  Well, you know, Tucker, it's interesting here in the mayor of Washington, DC, which is where [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=94.18s)]
*  I'm sitting right now, complaining about 4,000 people on 200 buses that Governor Abbott has [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=98.94000000000001s)]
*  sent to Washington, DC since April, running to the Pentagon saying, oh my gosh, we need [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  the National Guard. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=109.1s)]
*  Oh, well, you know what? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=110.1s)]
*  Cry me a frickin' river, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=111.46s)]
*  You know, welcome to the party, pal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=112.94s)]
*  Down in Texas, today in the border, we're going to have about 7,000 people crossing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=114.78s)]
*  the border, across the entire Southwest border, and about half of that in Texas. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=119.14s)]
*  Cry me a river about the, I don't know, 50 bodies in a mobile morgue in Brooks County, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=122.74s)]
*  Texas, where Sheriff Benny Martinez is having to deal with dead migrants all over the ranches. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  Talk to the families that are, you know, concerned about the people packing pistols, like this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=131.62s)]
*  illegal immigrant on a ranch that I just got this picture about an hour ago from the county [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=137.14s)]
*  attorney in Kenny County, Texas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=141.22s)]
*  That's what we're dealing with every day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=143.46s)]
*  So welcome to the party, pal. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=144.62s)]
*  I don't want to really hear all your complaining. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=145.62s)]
*  And you want to talk about racism. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=147.3s)]
*  How about the racism about a DHS that is forcing these border patrol agents to be accused of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=149.34s)]
*  whipping Haitians and being called racist with a completely unfounded charge? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=156.14s)]
*  I'm just sick of this garbage. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=160.94s)]
*  Well, I am too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=161.94s)]
*  I agree with that completely. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=162.94s)]
*  Congressman Chipporah of Texas, thank you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=163.94s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=166.54s)]
*  changing the world and changing your life. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=171.66s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVioPMWHX8&t=174.22s)]
