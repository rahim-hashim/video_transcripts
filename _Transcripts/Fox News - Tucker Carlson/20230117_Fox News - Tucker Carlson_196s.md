# UFO expert shares stunning details about alleged 1945 alien encounter before Roswell
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM)
*  So history has recorded the first big UFO sighting in the United States is 1947 in Roswell, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=0.0s)]
*  New Mexico, very famously right outside Roswell. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=15.52s)]
*  But actually, there was in some sense a bigger and more significant event sighting two years [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  before also in New Mexico at exactly the moment the US government was detonating the first [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=23.16s)]
*  atomic weapon shortly thereafter used in Japan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=27.32s)]
*  And witnesses on the ground saw some kind of object shaped like an avocado, they said, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=30.76s)]
*  crash land. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  It was inspected by a lot of locals. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=38.8s)]
*  There are beings inside, they said, and it was carted away by the US government. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=40.88s)]
*  Now people don't want to be called crazy, so no one said too much about it for quite [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=44.44s)]
*  some years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=48.8s)]
*  But people within the US government believe it's true and they believe it so strongly [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=50.0s)]
*  Now, as of this week, the Defense Department's annual spending bill will require, as per [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=54.8s)]
*  Congress, the Pentagon to go back and investigate what really happened. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=60.8s)]
*  Nick Pope is a former UK Ministry of Defense official who's followed this very closely. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=65.0s)]
*  He joins us to assess. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=69.16s)]
*  Nick, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=70.64s)]
*  So this is a story that most I think Americans are not even aware of, but clearly people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=72.28s)]
*  within the US government believe it's real or they wouldn't have attached this to a spending [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=79.16s)]
*  bill, correct? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=82.56s)]
*  Correct, yes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=83.56s)]
*  This is being called the Roswell before Roswell. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=86.44s)]
*  And you're right, people with some knowledge of these intelligence programs who've been [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=89.8s)]
*  briefing Congress about this made sure that this was put into the legislation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=93.88s)]
*  And it's one of many UFO provisions in the new defense bill. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=99.5s)]
*  The DOD must provide Congress with a list of everything they found out about this, this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=104.2s)]
*  specific incident, but all other incidents and programs from January 1st, 1945 onwards. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  And anyone involved in these programs or with information about it will be released from [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  their secrecy oaths and nondisclosure agreements and they'll be able to testify to Congress [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=121.92s)]
*  about this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=127.0s)]
*  So here we have the nuclear connection again. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=128.76s)]
*  This was around the first detonation in human history of a nuclear device. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  Subsequent to that, you've had UFO sightings at nuclear missile bases, around nuclear-powered [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=134.6s)]
*  aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=138.73999999999998s)]
*  There's clearly some nuclear, I mean I don't pretend to understand, but nuclear has some [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  connection to these sightings, no? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=145.92s)]
*  That seems to be the case. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=150.42s)]
*  And again, Congress is demanding answers on this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  We had the latest report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence last [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=155.54s)]
*  week that highlighted the fact that there were several hundred more sightings being [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  investigated, military sightings than we'd heard of before, talked about unusual flight [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=165.62s)]
*  characteristics and performance parameters of this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=170.73999999999998s)]
*  And yeah, we must get to the bottom of this UFO and nuclear connection. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I would think, and it feels like we're getting closer, I hope. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=177.94s)]
*  Nick Pope, thank you for your work on this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=181.7s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=183.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0ZAoYTQZM&t=185.06s)]
