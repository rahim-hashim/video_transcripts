# Women's rights activist scorches this 'sinister' part of the left
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI)
*  It feels like just the other day that you had to believe all women because women never lie. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=0.0s)]
*  There's different that way biologically. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=4.64s)]
*  Now you can acknowledge that because no one can define what a woman is, not even people [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=7.36s)]
*  who want to sit on a Supreme Court. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=11.42s)]
*  And if you try to define them, you will get in big trouble. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  We for example are still locked out of our Twitter account for affirming the obvious, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=16.12s)]
*  biological sex is real, it's set at birth, no one in human history has ever doubted that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=20.84s)]
*  because it's true. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=24.78s)]
*  But some people are still willing to say that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=26.32s)]
*  We showed you this clip the other night. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=28.38s)]
*  It shows one woman watching as Leah Thomas, who is a man, wins a women's swimming competition. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=29.72s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=35.56s)]
*  I'm a woman. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=36.56s)]
*  That is not a woman. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=37.56s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=38.56s)]
*  That is not a woman. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=39.56s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=40.56s)]
*  Do you have ovaries? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=41.56s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=42.56s)]
*  Yeah go on then ask me a question. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=43.56s)]
*  What was that? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=44.56s)]
*  I'm not asking you a question. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=45.56s)]
*  Are you a myosin? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=46.56s)]
*  Oh my god don't be ridiculous. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=47.56s)]
*  I'm not a vet but I know what a dog is. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=48.56s)]
*  So we said we were going to try and find the woman who said that and we did. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=55.28s)]
*  Her name is Kelly J Keane. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=57.8s)]
*  She's a founder of Standing for Women and we're happy to have her join us tonight. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on Kelly J Keane. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=63.04s)]
*  Oh thank you so much. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=65.36s)]
*  So you're not afraid to say what's true. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=67.56s)]
*  Why are you not afraid? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=69.88s)]
*  Oh I think it's my duty. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=71.36s)]
*  I think because it needs to be said I'm 100% sure that I have to say it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=73.84s)]
*  There's many people that are afraid, that are in positions where they feel they're going [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=81.4s)]
*  to lose their jobs. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=84.44s)]
*  We can't all be silent otherwise the world is going fast to having a handcart. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=87.0s)]
*  I think that's exactly right but why is this important? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=93.76s)]
*  I mean there are a lot of fake things going on, people lie all the time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  You've taken a stand on this specific issue. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=103.04s)]
*  How come? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=104.84s)]
*  Well I think if you can no longer define what a woman is we can't talk about women. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=105.84s)]
*  Our language is being diluted all over the place. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  In the UK and I'm sure in the US women are called cervix havers, menstruators, chest [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=115.8s)]
*  feeders, birthing persons. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  So we have to give up the language that describes us. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  But the only people that are allowed to be called women these days are actually men. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=126.36s)]
*  So this seems, far be it from me to weigh in on what it must feel like as a woman but [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=132.64s)]
*  it does seem degrading to be called a cervix haver. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=138.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean what? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=142.04s)]
*  It is ultimately really sexist, like the most pernicious sexism. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=143.48s)]
*  That's what's happening to women all over the world. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=149.92s)]
*  So why aren't people who say they have the interests of women at heart standing up and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=154.04s)]
*  saying no you can't pretend that being a woman is as simple as changing your clothes? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  This I've thought about long and hard. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=167.44s)]
*  I think it comes to cowardice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=169.68s)]
*  I think it comes to cult-like mentality. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=172.12s)]
*  I think these people are brainwashed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  They are experiencing truckloads of cognitive dissonance. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=177.4s)]
*  I talked to many girls outside of the swimming pool who, you know, you said the question [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=181.68s)]
*  like what is a woman? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  And they literally would not speak. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=189.96s)]
*  It's really sinister. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=192.96s)]
*  Well it is sinister because it seems like the biggest and best organised bullying campaign [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=193.96s)]
*  against a population ever organised. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=200.52s)]
*  Did anybody at the meet say wait a second that's cheating? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=203.36s)]
*  This man is cheating because that's what it is. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=206.32s)]
*  I don't think anyone dared say it which is why I really felt I had to say something. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=209.36s)]
*  There was just this oppressive silence on everybody knew that there was a man in the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=215.96s)]
*  pool racing with the girls. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=220.6s)]
*  Everybody knew it and those that knew it wouldn't say it but the person in front of me was quite [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=223.76s)]
*  happy to say that he was definitely a woman. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=230.24s)]
*  So it's just really scary. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=234.12s)]
*  This is why those of us and it's fantastic that you talk about this quite a lot Tucker [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=236.56s)]
*  because so many other broadcasters are simply too afraid. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=242.8s)]
*  Yeah I mean I could care less how you dress or what you call yourself but this is not [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  liberation this is the dark ages and you have remained cheerful and honest in the middle [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=251.12s)]
*  of it and I really admire that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFl88Wkz6eI&t=255.3s)]
