# Jason Rantz: Seattle watering down drive by shooting sentences due to perp's race
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE)
*  So a new bill proposed by Democrats in Washington State wants to create lower sentences for drive-by shootings. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=0.0s)]
*  The bill's sponsors say it's about promoting, quote, racial equity. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=6.0s)]
*  Because apparently enforcing the law against violent drive-by shooters is somehow racist. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=10.0s)]
*  Jason Rantz is a radio host in the Pacific Northwest, and he joins us now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=15.0s)]
*  Jason, great to see you. How is punishing drive-by shootings racist? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, it's not racist, but they say it's racist because apparently it's been used to go after drive-by shooters as it was intended, and they just happen to be black. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=26.0s)]
*  That's the argument that they're trying to make. That's the only argument that they could try to make. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=35.0s)]
*  But obviously, if someone is white and is committing a drive-by shooting, they too would be subject to the exact same law. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=40.0s)]
*  So as it stands, this bill basically says it can no longer be considered an aggravating issue concerning a first-degree murder charge. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=47.0s)]
*  Now, the aggregating factor makes it a mandatory life sentence without parole. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=55.0s)]
*  So instead, you would be hit with a murder one charge, and that generally is 20 to 30 years punishment. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=60.0s)]
*  It could be life in prison, but that generally doesn't happen. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=66.0s)]
*  The funny thing about this is this particular aggravating murder charge isn't used very often. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=69.0s)]
*  In fact, one of the lawmakers behind this, her name is Tara Simmons herself, by the way, a convicted felon who made it into the state legislature. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=75.0s)]
*  She said it's only been used once. Now, I don't necessarily think that that's the case. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=83.0s)]
*  This is something that's not very easily trackable. But let's say it was, in fact, used just once. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=87.0s)]
*  That literally means it is not racist. It is not being used to target black people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=91.0s)]
*  And this would have zero impact whatsoever on racial equity in the criminal justice system. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=96.0s)]
*  One time does not mean it is a problem. In fact, the argument should be that we're not using it enough. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=102.0s)]
*  So it's the rationale, Jason, that lawmakers in California have used to go about leaving shoplifting, for example, and small theft unpunished [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=109.0s)]
*  because they saw a disparate impact on African Americans punished under those laws. So their solution was don't punish those laws. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=117.0s)]
*  It's the same rationale here with drive-by shootings. The vast majority of drive-by shooters are black. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=124.0s)]
*  So therefore, enforcing that law would be racist. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=129.0s)]
*  Here's my question to you, Jason. What is the racial makeup of the victims of drive-by shootings? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=132.0s)]
*  The vast majority of drive-by shooting victims are black. So if you're going to tell me that this is about protecting the black community, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=138.0s)]
*  sorry, you're not protecting the black community. In fact, the communities that are being impacted the most by drive-by shootings, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=146.0s)]
*  which happen to be represented by David Hackney, the other state representative who's behind this bill who won't answer any questions about it, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=152.0s)]
*  they're the ones who have been asking, begging for more help, including more policing, to go after the rise in gun violence that South Seattle in particular [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=158.0s)]
*  has been experiencing over the course of the last two years. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=167.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would suggest that drive-by shootings have a disparate impact on black victims. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=171.0s)]
*  And I would ask lawmakers, why are you concerned about the disparate impact on criminals and not on victims? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=176.0s)]
*  That's a question I'm not sure we'll get an answer to, Jason. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=182.0s)]
*  But you can search for it, and I'm sure you will on your radio show there in Washington state. Thanks, Jason. Great to talk to you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=185.0s)]
*  Thanks Will, appreciate it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEfbiuwm6TE&t=191.0s)]
