# Tulsi calls out Kamala on cannabis hypocrisy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c)
*  In a 2019 presidential debate, Tulsi Gabbard called out Kamala and her record on stage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=7.8s)]
*  president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=12.36s)]
*  There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=20.16s)]
*  She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=24.92s)]
*  forced her to do so. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=32.56s)]
*  She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=34.2s)]
*  California and she fought to keep the cash bail system in place that impacts poor people [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=38.68s)]
*  in the worst kind of way. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=45.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris did not like that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=47.36s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is a former presidential candidate and congresswoman and she joins us now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=50.0s)]
*  Tulsi, great to see you to add to that inconsistency. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=54.84s)]
*  We now have Kamala today condemning Russia. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=57.28s)]
*  How do we make sense of the vice president? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=60.6s)]
*  That's a great question, Will. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=66.68s)]
*  Another note of hypocrisy coming from Kamala Harris and this administration is, as you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  mentioned how during her illustrious record as attorney general in California, you gave [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  some of those examples, she kept prisoners in prison longer than their sentences to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=78.76s)]
*  use them as free slave labor, yet at the same time these very same people are condemning [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=84.84s)]
*  other countries for doing the exact same thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=90.36s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  The thing that struck me when I saw Kamala Harris's tweet and her statement expressing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=94.92s)]
*  this outrage about Brittany Greiner, first of all, let me say, I don't think anybody [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=99.12s)]
*  anywhere in the world should be imprisoned for marijuana possession. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=105.66s)]
*  Period. Full stop. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=109.58s)]
*  When you look at Kamala Harris's statement on Twitter, she's expressing this outrage [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=111.3s)]
*  about Brittany Greiner. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=114.58s)]
*  My question for her and the Biden administration is where is your outrage for your fellow Americans [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=115.9s)]
*  who are sitting in prison today here in the United States of America because of minor [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  marijuana violations? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=126.26s)]
*  How come you are not fighting as hard for them to be returned home and reunited with [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=127.94s)]
*  their families as you are for Brittany Greiner? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=133.06s)]
*  And to me, the message to the American people through their actions is loud and clear is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=135.5s)]
*  that if you are rich and powerful or famous, then you will get special treatment from this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=140.02s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  If you are not, we don't care about you and we're going to let you sit there in rotten [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  jail. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=150.34s)]
*  Tulsi, do you think that's what it is? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=151.34s)]
*  It's simply sheer unadulterated elite-ism or is it a reflection of Kamala Harris's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=154.02s)]
*  emptiness that she is simply willing to play to wherever the current climate stream river [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=161.5s)]
*  is flowing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=167.62s)]
*  When it was flowing in California to prosecute marijuana, she was happy to ride that stream. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=169.0s)]
*  And when it's unpopular, she's happy to go on a morning show and pretend that she listened [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=174.22000000000003s)]
*  to Tupac Shakur years before he ever came out and laugh along to the idea that she smoked [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=177.66000000000003s)]
*  marijuana. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=183.18s)]
*  It seems she's an empty vessel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=184.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think it's both. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  As you pointed out, the evidence really is in her record, not only on this issue, but [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=189.62s)]
*  I know there are a lot of examples on other issues where, unfortunately, like too many [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  politicians, it seems like she puts her finger to the wind and decides what things she's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=199.5s)]
*  supposed to be angry about on any given day. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=204.5s)]
*  And then if it becomes politically inconvenient or damaging, then she'll switch the other [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  way. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  We saw this, I know, health care was one issue during the presidential campaign. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, she gave almost opposing answers on that issue, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=216.5s)]
*  leaving even the mainstream media, like the New York Times, saying, what do you actually, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=221.98s)]
*  where do you stand on health care? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=226.46s)]
*  And so, you know, I think it's unfortunate. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=229.3s)]
*  It's unfortunate that we have a vice president of the United States who doesn't appear to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=231.3s)]
*  stand for anything other than herself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=234.76s)]
*  You make a great point, though. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, condemning Russia for something that the vice president has very little control, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=240.06s)]
*  while leaving Americans to suffer under the punishment of those very similar laws right [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=244.86s)]
*  here in America where you do have control. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=249.62s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, you called her out then. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=251.9s)]
*  Thank you for calling her out again tonight. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537ddnPR93c&t=254.38000000000002s)]
