# Tucker: This is what Biden left unsaid last night
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, Joe Biden delivered this country's first ever [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=2.12s)]
*  state of Ukraine address last night. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=4.36s)]
*  Biden spoke for a little more than an hour [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=6.44s)]
*  before a joint session of Congress. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=8.0s)]
*  He talked far more about Ukraine [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=9.56s)]
*  and with much greater passion than about any other topic. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=11.64s)]
*  If that sounds strange for an American president [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=14.88s)]
*  in a speech that's supposed to be about America, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=17.28s)]
*  it didn't seem weird at all within the context of last night. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=19.92s)]
*  Biden delivered exactly the speech [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=23.36s)]
*  his audience wanted to hear. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=25.28s)]
*  Virtually every lawmaker in the room last night [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  from both parties arrived wearing some version [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=29.24s)]
*  of the Ukrainian flag. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=33.36s)]
*  came with both a Ukrainian-themed pocket square [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  and a Ukrainian flag lapel pin. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=37.96s)]
*  That's about as Ukrainian as you can get. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=40.4s)]
*  Even the president of Ukraine doesn't do that very often. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  What McCarthy conspicuously didn't do [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=48.36s)]
*  was don an American flag pin. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=51.04s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=54.08s)]
*  And many others went without that too [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=55.28s)]
*  because within the context of last night, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=57.72s)]
*  the American flag was literally irrelevant. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  Lots of our leaders feel that way all of a sudden. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=63.32s)]
*  At this stage, the full force of America's federal government, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=66.6s)]
*  the White House, the Congress, the many intelligence [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=69.52s)]
*  and defense and law enforcement agencies, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=71.92s)]
*  all of it has been redirected to avenge the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=74.28s)]
*  Notice the verb, avenge, not defend. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=79.08s)]
*  Now ideally, you'd like to think there'd be some way [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=82.36s)]
*  to defend Ukraine from Russian aggression. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=84.36s)]
*  That might be worth doing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=86.96s)]
*  But at this point, there isn't. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  It's too late. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=90.08s)]
*  Joe Biden's deterrent strategy failed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=91.36s)]
*  Putin already invaded the country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  Short of destroying Ukraine, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=95.8s)]
*  there is no way to liberate Ukraine by force. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=97.32s)]
*  All we can do is punish the Russians [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  for what they've already done. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=103.24s)]
*  And that, Joe Biden told us last night, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  is exactly what he plans to do. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=106.72s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  The ruble has already lost 30% of its value. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=114.48s)]
*  and trading remains suspended. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  The Russian economy is reeling [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  and Putin alone is the one to blame. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=122.72s)]
*  So the Russian economy is being destroyed, is destroyed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=127.28s)]
*  Imagine living in a country where the currency [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=129.88s)]
*  drops 30 points in a single day. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  What would that feel like? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, 143 million Russians now know [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=135.4s)]
*  they're much poorer than they were two days ago. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=138.16s)]
*  Only a relative handful of those Russians [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=140.8s)]
*  had any role in the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=142.6s)]
*  Many of them opposed it, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  but all of them are being hurt as their economy comes apart. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=146.44s)]
*  And that's fine because they all deserve it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=150.32s)]
*  Michael McFaul, Barack Obama's former ambassador to Moscow, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=153.92s)]
*  who now teaches at Stanford University, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=156.6s)]
*  announced today that every single person in Russia, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=158.56s)]
*  every single one, bears the guilt of the Ukraine invasion. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=162.12s)]
*  Quote, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=165.48s)]
*  there are no more innocent, neutral Russians anymore. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=166.32s)]
*  Everyone has to make a choice, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  support or oppose this war. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=171.68s)]
*  So to restate and be clear, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=174.28s)]
*  there's no such thing as an innocent Russian. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=175.88s)]
*  One of our foremost Russia scholars has told us so. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Putin may have given the orders to invade Ukraine, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  but six-year-old girls in St. Petersburg [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  should pay the price for it because they deserve it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  Their 80-year-old grandmothers deserve it too. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=188.52s)]
*  In order to fight tyranny, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=190.96s)]
*  the United States must embrace collective punishment, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=192.32s)]
*  hurt the children to bring justice. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=194.88s)]
*  These are our values, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=197.08s)]
*  because Vladimir Putin is a moral monster. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=198.84s)]
*  Now these are not traditional Western concepts of justice, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=202.0s)]
*  but Joe Biden wholeheartedly endorses them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=205.4s)]
*  And so does a dominant bipartisan coalition [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=207.72s)]
*  in the United States Congress. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=209.76s)]
*  The question is, is this a wise course? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=211.76s)]
*  Now we can't say, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=214.76s)]
*  far be it for us to suggest [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=216.4s)]
*  thinking through world-changing policies [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=217.84s)]
*  in any way before enacting them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=220.28s)]
*  Pausing to reflect, we have learned, is disloyal. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  Adult moral calculations are treason. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=226.04s)]
*  Thinking about your own country is a crime. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=228.76s)]
*  Act now or be denounced. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=232.16s)]
*  So we're gonna withhold judgment on all of this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=233.76s)]
*  But we did notice one question [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  that Joe Biden failed to answer last night or even address, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=237.72s)]
*  and that is, what's the point of all of this? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=240.04s)]
*  Putin is bad, no one in America is gonna argue with that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=243.72s)]
*  But will destroying the entire Russian economy [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  make Putin less bad? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=248.88s)]
*  Will it force Russian troops to withdraw from Ukraine? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=251.12s)]
*  And if it will, how exactly will that work, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=253.88s)]
*  and how long will it take? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=256.2s)]
*  Where's the plan bigger than that? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=258.28s)]
*  Is the idea that we can force Vladimir Putin [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=259.4s)]
*  from office entirely? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=261.28s)]
*  Okay, will that work? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=262.91999999999996s)]
*  And if it does work, what happens to Russia [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  after Vladimir Putin leaves? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=268.35999999999996s)]
*  Would the next Russian president [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=270.32s)]
*  be an improvement over Putin? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=271.64s)]
*  Or would Russia descend into barbarous chaos [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan did [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  once we overthrew their governments? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=278.32s)]
*  Now you may not care what happens to Russia, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=281.08s)]
*  but you have to wonder, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  what would become of Russia's enormous nuclear stockpile [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=284.52s)]
*  under those circumstances? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=287.68s)]
*  Take a moment and think. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=288.8s)]
*  Are there potentially ways that thousands [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=290.64s)]
*  of unsecured Russian nukes might pose a long-term threat [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=293.48s)]
*  to the United States? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=297.56s)]
*  Something to think about, not that anyone is. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=300.06s)]
*  The immediate goal, again, the bipartisan goal, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=302.64s)]
*  is to turn Russia into a pariah state. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=305.2s)]
*  Now again, the question isn't whether Vladimir Putin [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=308.08s)]
*  deserves that, it's more than a moral question. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=310.04s)]
*  The question is, how will that work out for us [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  and for the world? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=317.08s)]
*  American citizens have a right to ask that question. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=318.28s)]
*  Start with history. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=321.56s)]
*  How has that worked with Iran and North Korea? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=322.52s)]
*  Now that those countries are cut off [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  from the fraternity of civilized nations, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=327.0s)]
*  are they more or less predictable? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=329.24s)]
*  Are they more or less dangerous to the United States? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=332.0s)]
*  Could it be possible that some of these steps, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=335.76s)]
*  in the end, turn out to be counterproductive [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  to our interests? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=341.2s)]
*  That's something to consider. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=343.36s)]
*  Keep in mind the people, the very people [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=345.16s)]
*  proposing all of this are the very same people [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  who defunded our police departments [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  and destroyed our schools and tore down [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=352.34000000000003s)]
*  the Teddy Roosevelt statue in New York City. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  They're the ones who armed the Taliban. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=356.48s)]
*  They're the ones who devalued the US dollar. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=358.68s)]
*  They're the ones who brought human slavery back to Libya. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=360.90000000000003s)]
*  They're very good at wrecking things. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  It's what they do. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=366.12s)]
*  They planned the Iraq War and they never apologized for it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=367.32000000000005s)]
*  So we might wanna make sure they don't wreck [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=371.24s)]
*  anything else ever again, especially this country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=373.24s)]
*  But once again, Joe Biden didn't address [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=377.38s)]
*  any of that last night. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=379.24s)]
*  He was too deep in his World War II fantasies [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=380.2s)]
*  with himself playing FDR. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=382.16s)]
*  For all of his moral outrage against Russia, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=384.22s)]
*  well deserved though it may be, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=386.18s)]
*  Biden made no mention of China's role [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=388.12s)]
*  in the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=390.66s)]
*  And that's weird. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=392.0s)]
*  More than any other country on earth, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=393.36s)]
*  China made this invasion possible. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=395.58s)]
*  China is Russia's most important ally [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=399.18s)]
*  in this war against Ukraine. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=401.8s)]
*  So you've gotta ask yourself, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=403.98s)]
*  as long as everyone's culpable who was involved, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=405.54s)]
*  why aren't we tanking China's currency? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=408.58s)]
*  Why aren't we banning Chinese planes [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=411.36s)]
*  from American airspace? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  Why aren't we confiscating the yachts of Chinese oligarchs? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=414.32s)]
*  But Biden never told us. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=417.68s)]
*  Maybe someone will ask him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=419.6s)]
*  But with that, Biden was off to other topics, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  but not the topics you would expect. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=423.32s)]
*  Biden never mentioned the word equity [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=425.36s)]
*  a single time last night. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=427.62s)]
*  We checked the transcript. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  That's very strange. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=431.16s)]
*  Equity was supposed to be the central focus [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=432.44s)]
*  of his entire administration. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=435.36s)]
*  That was just 13 months ago. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=436.68s)]
*  He told us that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=438.16s)]
*  And we still have the tape. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=439.68s)]
*  We need to open the promise of America to every American. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=442.16s)]
*  And that means we need to make the issue of racial equity [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  not just an issue for any one department of government. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=450.16s)]
*  It has to be the business of the whole of government. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=454.48s)]
*  Well, that is a very abrupt change. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=458.28s)]
*  And again, it's worth marking these changes [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=461.32s)]
*  because no one seems to notice them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=463.2s)]
*  In the space of one year, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=465.28s)]
*  equity went from quote, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=467.0s)]
*  the business of the whole government [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=468.28s)]
*  to something the president doesn't even mention [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=470.88s)]
*  in a state of the union address. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=473.2s)]
*  What's that about? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  Was equity not quite as popular as they expected? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=476.88s)]
*  And there were a number of moments like that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=480.11999999999995s)]
*  in last night's speech, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=481.96s)]
*  moments that left you scratching your head. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=482.84s)]
*  At one point, Joe Biden said, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=484.91999999999996s)]
*  we need to fund police departments, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=486.08s)]
*  the ones that his party defunded. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  And then, in case you hadn't had enough beers by that point, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=491.52s)]
*  Joe Biden said, we must secure the border. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=494.76s)]
*  Now, why is Joe Biden saying this? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=499.0s)]
*  Far be it for us to suggest [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  they were terrifying internal polls [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  suggesting he has to say those things. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=504.4s)]
*  But we're starting to conclude that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=507.68s)]
*  because just a few minutes after Joe Biden said, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  we need to secure the border, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  he announced amnesty for millions of foreign nationals [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=512.12s)]
*  who snuck into our country. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=515.36s)]
*  We also have that tape watch. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=516.48s)]
*  Provide a pathway to citizenship for dreamers, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  those with temporary status, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=521.6400000000001s)]
*  farm workers, essential workers. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=523.5200000000001s)]
*  Revise our laws [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=525.24s)]
*  so businesses have workers they need [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  and families don't wait decades to reunite. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not only the right thing to do, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=535.48s)]
*  it's economically smart thing to do. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=536.7600000000001s)]
*  That's the economically smart thing to do. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=539.6400000000001s)]
*  Give your job to a foreigner [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=541.96s)]
*  and if you don't, you're immoral. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=543.36s)]
*  So that category, just to restate, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=545.16s)]
*  is dreamers, those with temporary status, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=546.44s)]
*  farm workers and something called essential workers. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=549.28s)]
*  Who do you think who's come across the border illegally, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=553.76s)]
*  the millions in the last 13 months, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=556.6s)]
*  would be denied the classification essential workers? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=559.08s)]
*  Well, of course, they're all essential, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=562.52s)]
*  every single one of them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=563.72s)]
*  So moments after telling us [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=565.36s)]
*  he's going to secure the border, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden just announced that everyone [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=567.92s)]
*  who's already snuck across the border [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=569.52s)]
*  gets to become a US citizen [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=570.88s)]
*  and needless to say, a democratic voter. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=572.6s)]
*  Like, immediately, because it's the right thing to do. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=574.28s)]
*  That was the portion of the speech [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  where he talked about our country. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=579.64s)]
*  So the first part was about how borders are sacrosanct [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=581.8s)]
*  and we should go to war to protect other people's borders [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=584.1999999999999s)]
*  and the second part was everyone who's already snuck in [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=586.56s)]
*  gets to become an American citizen. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=590.28s)]
*  Does that apply to Russian soldiers in Ukraine? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  What are the principles here exactly? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=595.04s)]
*  Then Biden went on to mention [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=597.3199999999999s)]
*  someone called Kentucky Brown Jackson. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=598.48s)]
*  Now that's not a name most Americans know [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=600.68s)]
*  because Kentucky Brown Jackson has been an appellate judge [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=602.2s)]
*  for less than a year. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  But Joe Biden is sure that she is, quote, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  one of our top legal minds. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=607.32s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=608.76s)]
*  We all know one of the most serious [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=609.6s)]
*  constitutional responsibility a president has [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  is nominating someone to serve [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=614.0400000000001s)]
*  on the United States Supreme Court. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=616.84s)]
*  As I did four days ago, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=620.32s)]
*  I've nominated the Circuit Court of Appeals, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=622.84s)]
*  Katanji Brown Jackson. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=626.0s)]
*  One of our nation's top legal minds. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=629.08s)]
*  So is Katanji Brown Jackson a name that even Joe Biden [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=633.4000000000001s)]
*  has trouble pronouncing one of the top legal minds [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  in the entire country? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=639.44s)]
*  Certainly hope so. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=640.4000000000001s)]
*  Biden's right. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=641.24s)]
*  Appointing her is one of his gravest constitutional duties. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=642.12s)]
*  So it might be time for Joe Biden to let us know [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=646.48s)]
*  what Katanji Brown Jackson's LSAT score was. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=648.76s)]
*  What else did she do in the LSAT? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't he tell us that? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=653.44s)]
*  That would settle the question conclusively [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=654.4000000000001s)]
*  as to whether she's a once in a generation legal talent, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=656.28s)]
*  the next Lord at hand. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=659.0s)]
*  It would seem like Americans in a democracy [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=660.84s)]
*  have a right to know that and much more [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=662.92s)]
*  before giving her a lifetime appointment, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=664.6s)]
*  but we didn't hear that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=666.16s)]
*  And that was just one of many things [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=668.2s)]
*  that Joe Biden left unsaid last night. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=669.52s)]
*  He alluded, for example, to rising crime, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=671.32s)]
*  but not his role in it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=673.88s)]
*  He claimed instead that it's gun companies, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=676.0s)]
*  not prosecutors funded by George Soros, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=678.48s)]
*  not the celebrity funds that bail out murderers [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=681.32s)]
*  that have made this country more dangerous. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=684.68s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=686.4s)]
*  Ban of saw weapons with high capacity magazines [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=687.52s)]
*  will hold up to a hundred rounds. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=689.8s)]
*  You think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=692.8s)]
*  Look, repeal the liability shield. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  It makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=698.56s)]
*  that can't be sued. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  The only one. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=702.8399999999999s)]
*  Now far be it for us to fact check Joe Biden. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=704.8399999999999s)]
*  Like questioning his foreign policy [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  that's Russian disinformation, it's disloyal, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=709.4799999999999s)]
*  it may be punishable under our treason laws. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=711.56s)]
*  But we should point out that what you just heard is, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=714.12s)]
*  what's the word, a lie. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  Gun manufacturers, of course, can be sued. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=718.5200000000001s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=720.4000000000001s)]
*  But now that Joe Biden mentioned it, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  there is in fact an industry in America [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=723.96s)]
*  that has total legal immunity from lawsuits. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=726.5200000000001s)]
*  That immunity was granted to that industry by Congress. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=729.4000000000001s)]
*  In fact, here you have a president [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=732.32s)]
*  who single-handedly turned that industry's [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=734.9200000000001s)]
*  corporate executives into billionaire oligarchs [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=737.32s)]
*  by forcing Americans to use their products. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=739.84s)]
*  They had to. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=742.64s)]
*  But here's the best part. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=744.24s)]
*  If the Americans who were forced to use those products [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=745.56s)]
*  were killed or injured by those products, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=747.68s)]
*  as many thousands have been over the last year, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=749.48s)]
*  they have no legal recourse. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=752.28s)]
*  They can't sue the industry. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=754.04s)]
*  They can't even complain about it on television [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=755.52s)]
*  or mention it on social media. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=757.64s)]
*  And now there can actual experts, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=760.28s)]
*  physicians and nurses, for example. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=761.96s)]
*  They've been silenced. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=763.56s)]
*  You know this perfectly well. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=765.68s)]
*  Biden knew this. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=767.8s)]
*  He was flacking for these companies [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=769.0s)]
*  the minute he got to the podium, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=770.64s)]
*  just like he flacked for the credit card companies [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=772.28s)]
*  in Delaware. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=774.0s)]
*  Many of the people he was speaking to last night [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=775.16s)]
*  in the room are invested in that industry. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=776.72s)]
*  But he never said a word about it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=780.04s)]
*  That's odd. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRQd5hctso&t=781.92s)]
