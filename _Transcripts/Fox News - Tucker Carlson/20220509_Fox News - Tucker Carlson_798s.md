# Tucker: This is about attacking Christianity
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, a week ago exactly, an unnamed saboteur at the Supreme Court leaked a draft opinion [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=3.04s)]
*  by Justice Sam Alito explaining why Roe v. Wade ought to be overturned. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=8.88s)]
*  Now, people went completely hysterical over it, but actually, as a legal matter, Alito's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=12.92s)]
*  views were not especially controversial. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=17.76s)]
*  Roe is bad law. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=20.46s)]
*  Over the past half century, many have acknowledged that, including many pro-choice Democrats, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=22.0s)]
*  including Joe Biden. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=26.68s)]
*  So at this point, 49 years in, if you're an officeholder who supports legal abortion, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=28.36s)]
*  the obvious solution is to vote for legal abortion. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=33.8s)]
*  Pass a law like they do in democracies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=37.8s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=40.8s)]
*  That's how it's supposed to work. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=42.3s)]
*  But Democrats have no interest in that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=44.08s)]
*  Democracy is a tiresome process and worst of all, the outcome isn't always guaranteed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=45.92s)]
*  They prefer what they call direct action, not democracy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=50.82s)]
*  So liberal activists immediately set about threatening Supreme Court justices and then [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=54.92s)]
*  attacking Christianity. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=59.2s)]
*  A group called Ruth Sentus, which is named in honor of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, posted the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=61.24s)]
*  home addresses of every Supreme Court justice who is conservative. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=65.88s)]
*  Why they do this? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=70.08s)]
*  Well, of course, to invite violence and harassment, to get them to change their votes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=71.08s)]
*  Then Ruth Sentus sent this to practicing Catholics across the country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=76.28s)]
*  Stuff your rosaries and your weaponized prayer. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=80.12s)]
*  We'll be burning the Eucharist to show our disgust for the abuse Catholic churches have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=83.12s)]
*  condoned for centuries. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=87.48s)]
*  Now you'd think the Biden administration might have something to say about this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=88.48s)]
*  It was all public. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden purports to be a Catholic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  Intimidating judges, by the way, is a federal crime. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=96.2s)]
*  But no, the Biden administration did not try and stop this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=99.84s)]
*  The Justice Department did nothing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=103.28s)]
*  In fact, from her podium at the White House, the president's publicist endorsed the coming [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=104.28s)]
*  harassment. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=109.04s)]
*  Clearly, quote, the president's view is that there's a lot of passion, a lot of fear, a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  lot of sadness from many, many people, Jen Psaki explained. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=114.64s)]
*  So the message to Joe Biden's abortion militia could not have been clear. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  Go forth and terrorize. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=121.64s)]
*  That's the word from the White House. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=123.72s)]
*  So that's exactly what they did. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=124.72s)]
*  Here's the mob this weekend outside Brett Kavanaugh's house. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=126.48s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh is a Supreme Court justice, but he's also a man and a husband and a father, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=141.04s)]
*  as you just saw. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  He lives in a pretty normal neighborhood outside D.C., doesn't have a wall around the house, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  and more to the point, his two daughters are home. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=150.2s)]
*  So imagine what it must have been like inside the house if you're Brett Kavanaugh or his [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=153.16s)]
*  wife or his daughters. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=157.34s)]
*  The people outside didn't care. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  The woman who organized that protest outside Kavanaugh's house lives right down the street, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=160.6s)]
*  apparently. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=165.04s)]
*  She's a deeply unhappy individual called Lacey Wooten Holloway. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=166.04s)]
*  Wooten Holloway brought the mob to Kavanaugh's house for a very specific reason, not just [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=170.2s)]
*  because she was angry, which she is, but because she wants Brett Kavanaugh to change his views [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  and support Roe v. Wade. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  She was intimidating a federal judge, all of them were. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  And once again, that's a federal crime. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=184.04s)]
*  It could not be clearer. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  And yet, Lacey Wooten Holloway, who bragged about organizing this, was not arrested. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=187.16s)]
*  She wasn't even scolded. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Instead, she was rewarded. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  Lacey Wooten Holloway got a glowing profile in the Washington Post. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=194.12s)]
*  So once again, in effect, our leaders in Washington sent a very clear message to the mob, as they [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=199.36s)]
*  did for BLM. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=203.96s)]
*  Do what you want. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=205.46s)]
*  We're on your side. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=206.46s)]
*  It's not like you're insurrectionists. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=207.58s)]
*  So the mob did. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=209.76s)]
*  Look what the mob did to this Christian counseling center in Wisconsin over the weekend. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=211.32s)]
*  If abortions aren't safe, then you aren't either. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=215.8s)]
*  That's just part of the message outside Wisconsin Family Action here, and it continues inside [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=218.72s)]
*  What you're seeing around me right now, this isn't the answer to anything. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=224.1s)]
*  Also written in debris and glass in her office, Wisconsin Family Action president Julian Appling [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=227.42s)]
*  says the message is clear. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=232.5s)]
*  It's precipitated by the leaked Supreme Court opinion, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=234.26s)]
*  I mean, it's obvious. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=238.94s)]
*  Madison police say it appears someone threw a Molotov cocktail inside the building. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=240.22s)]
*  You're not safe. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  Now, the Christian counseling center had nothing to do with Samuel Lido's opinion. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  Of course, the Christian counseling center only talks to women who are pregnant and aren't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=251.66s)]
*  sure what to do next. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=256.9s)]
*  They don't make money doing it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=258.86s)]
*  They're not playing parenthood. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=259.94s)]
*  They're not getting rich by giving gender altering chemicals to your kids or committing [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=261.14s)]
*  abortion. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=266.06s)]
*  No, they're just talking to girls who are confused and upset. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=267.06s)]
*  Some of those girls wind up having abortions anyway, but the people at the Christian counseling [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=270.5s)]
*  center are trying their best to do their duty. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=273.38s)]
*  They're not doing anything aggressive at all. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=275.46s)]
*  But because their views are repugnant to the left, their building was firebombed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  You're not safe, said the fire bombers. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=281.54s)]
*  Apparently, they aren't. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  So how did the media cover this? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=285.1s)]
*  Well, here's Politico, which is not even a news organization anymore. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=286.38s)]
*  Here's how they describe this firebombing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=290.02000000000004s)]
*  Quote, a fire broke out Sunday at the office of an anti-abortion group in Madison, Wisconsin. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=291.62s)]
*  Oh, a fire broke out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=297.3s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=298.86s)]
*  The Hill newspaper agreed. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=299.94s)]
*  Quote, fire breaks out at Wisconsin anti-abortion group office. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=301.1s)]
*  Oh, just broke out. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=305.3s)]
*  According to the police chief in Madison, where it happened, quote, the arson is not [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=307.86s)]
*  considered a terrorist incident. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=311.74s)]
*  So firebombing with Molotov cocktails for political reasons, threats left on the wall [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=313.54s)]
*  and spray paint, definitely not terrorism. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=319.14s)]
*  Let's call it activism because, you know, a fire broke out. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=321.34s)]
*  So of course, fires will continue to break out, if that's your posture. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=325.26s)]
*  And they are. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=329.42s)]
*  And more. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=330.42s)]
*  Here's surveillance footage that we obtained of an attack on the Christian nonprofit Concerned [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=331.42s)]
*  that's based in Alexandria, Virginia, right across the river from Washington. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  You can see a man tearing the intercom from the wall, exposing himself and a lot more. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=338.66s)]
*  So this just happened over the weekend in response to Sam Alito's opinion, with which [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  Concerned Women for America had nothing to do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=348.1s)]
*  They had no role in it whatsoever, but because they're Christians, they were attacked. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=350.74s)]
*  The FBI has been notified. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=354.66s)]
*  Have arrests been made? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=356.94s)]
*  No, it's not September. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=357.94s)]
*  It's not January 6th. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=358.94s)]
*  No one stopped the person who did that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  No one's arrested him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=363.42s)]
*  No one has stopped the thugs who terrorized Sunday Masses yesterday either, across the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=365.1s)]
*  country. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=367.82s)]
*  This was the scene of the Sunday Mass in Los Angeles. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=368.82s)]
*  So among other things, sincerely, the religious people are a reviled minority at this point [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=395.42s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=403.18s)]
*  And the Biden administration has made it its job, its self-described job, to protect unpopular [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=404.18s)]
*  minority groups. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=408.74s)]
*  There's also, by the way, a federal law that makes intimidating churchgoers illegal. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=409.74s)]
*  It's 18 USC 247 for the record. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=414.18s)]
*  But the Biden administration has no interest in protecting this particular reviled minority. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=417.86s)]
*  They're ignoring the whole thing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=422.82s)]
*  That means that churches now need armed guards to protect themselves, but those guards are [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=424.4s)]
*  also now being targeted. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=430.12s)]
*  Pay you to take care of people! [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=431.12s)]
*  We f***ing pay you to take care of pieces of s***! [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=432.12s)]
*  You never do it! [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=433.12s)]
*  You're the s***! [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=434.12s)]
*  What are you gonna do? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=435.12s)]
*  Shoot us! [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=436.12s)]
*  That's not what they shoot us! [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=437.12s)]
*  I shot off these s***! [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=438.12s)]
*  Don't you dare tell me I'm embarrassing! [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=439.12s)]
*  So you'd think that churches in Texas would be safe. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=452.72s)]
*  After all, it's Texas. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=455.36s)]
*  But no. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  St. Bartholomew Catholic Church in Katy, Texas, now reports that the tabernacle was just stolen [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  last night. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  Again, likely in response to the Alito opinion. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=463.90000000000003s)]
*  And this was seen outside the Basilica of St. Patrick's, Old Cathedral in New York City [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=466.70000000000005s)]
*  on Saturday. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=470.68s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=471.68s)]
*  Let the f***ing terrorize it! [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=473.68s)]
*  F***ing f***ing terrorize it! [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=476.68s)]
*  F***ing terrorize it! [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=479.68s)]
*  F***ing terrorize it! [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=481.68s)]
*  It's none of your f***ing business! [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=483.68s)]
*  It's none of your f***ing business! [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=486.68s)]
*  What? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=489.68s)]
*  What? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=490.68s)]
*  I'm killing the racist! [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=491.68s)]
*  I'm killing the f***ing racist! [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=493.68s)]
*  I'm killing them! [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=496.68s)]
*  I'm killing them! [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=500.68s)]
*  I'm killing the baby! [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=503.68s)]
*  I'm killing the baby! [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=506.68s)]
*  Could you get away with that outside any other religious center? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=508.68s)]
*  Any other group of worshipers? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  We wouldn't support it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  So maybe you're starting to think this isn't actually about Roe. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's about something more than that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's about something much darker than that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  Take a look at what Democrats are doing in Congress right now [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=528.68s)]
*  if you want a sense of what their plans are. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=531.68s)]
*  This is a real passage from a new abortion bill [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=533.68s)]
*  that Democrats are trying to get through the Congress. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=536.68s)]
*  And we're quoting, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=538.68s)]
*  This act is intended to protect all people with the capacity for pregnancy, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=539.68s)]
*  cisgender women, transgender men, nonbinary individuals, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=544.68s)]
*  those who identify with a different gender, and others. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=548.68s)]
*  So there it is. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=552.68s)]
*  It's not really about codifying Roe. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=553.68s)]
*  Abortions for people who, quote, need them, safe, legal, and rare. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=557.68s)]
*  It's about something much bigger than that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=560.68s)]
*  It's about displacing God as the great decider. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=562.68s)]
*  Democrats now reserve the right to rewrite biology, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=565.68s)]
*  which is to say, dominion over nature. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=568.68s)]
*  Now they're in charge. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=571.68s)]
*  So again, this isn't just about intimidating Supreme Court justices, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=573.68s)]
*  five of them, into changing their views on Roe v. Wade. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=577.68s)]
*  It's about attacking Christianity, because Christianity stands in their way. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=580.68s)]
*  MSNBC just comes out and says it. Watch. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=585.68s)]
*  The Christian rights decades-long push to revoke abortion rights [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=588.68s)]
*  is just part of their broader agenda. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=592.68s)]
*  Well, what else do they want? What else is at stake? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=594.68s)]
*  This is not just about abortion. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=597.68s)]
*  This is about a much broader set of issues [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=599.68s)]
*  that really are about a kind of white Christian right worldview. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=602.68s)]
*  It's very important for us to recognize that it is Christian extremism [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=607.68s)]
*  that is at the root of the shame and the stigma [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=611.68s)]
*  that allows laws like this to pass, that allows justices like this to be confirmed. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=613.68s)]
*  ...discovered that they could manufacture and then channel their moral outrage toward abortion, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=618.68s)]
*  creating a new litmus test for conservative politicians. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=623.68s)]
*  References to God and Christian beliefs are often invoked in these political instances, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=626.68s)]
*  with some saying outright that they believe America is a Christian nation. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=630.68s)]
*  So they're mad not really just at Alito, but at Christianity and Christians, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=636.68s)]
*  as believers, people of faith. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=641.68s)]
*  They have been for a long time, but it's weird if you think about it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=643.68s)]
*  Why are liberals angry at Christianity? You wouldn't think they would be. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=646.68s)]
*  Christianity has been the single greatest force for human rights in history. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=650.68s)]
*  In fact, the Western understanding of human rights, our understanding of human rights, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=653.68s)]
*  all of us, atheists included, is based on Christianity. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=657.68s)]
*  That's where it comes from. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=660.68s)]
*  Christianity is the reason we don't have slavery and segregation [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=661.68s)]
*  and children working in factories. Christians did that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=664.68s)]
*  So if you're a sincere liberal, it would seem odd to hate Christians. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=667.68s)]
*  But the totalitarians always do hate Christians. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=671.68s)]
*  The Soviets killed the priests first. So did Mao. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=675.68s)]
*  During the Spanish Civil War, the communists subjected a statue of Jesus [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=677.68s)]
*  to a symbolic execution in front of a firing squad. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=681.68s)]
*  It was one of the first things they did within weeks of the war breaking out. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=684.68s)]
*  Here's the picture on your screen. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=687.68s)]
*  Shooting Jesus. It tells you everything. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=690.68s)]
*  So modern liberals hate Christianity not because it's repressive, but because they are. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=693.68s)]
*  Any religion that puts God before government is by definition a threat to their power. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=699.68s)]
*  Most defensive of all, Christianity specifically rejects their most cherished dogma, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=705.68s)]
*  which is racial hierarchy. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=710.68s)]
*  The Christian message is the opposite of the equity agenda. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=712.68s)]
*  Christianity describes a universal brotherhood of man. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=716.68s)]
*  Every person created in God's image and therefore for that reason, morally equal. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=719.68s)]
*  That is gravely disempowering for the left. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=725.68s)]
*  If all people are morally equal, you can't really divide your population by skin color. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=729.68s)]
*  You can't really set one group against another. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=736.68s)]
*  You can't tell one group you're better than that group. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=739.68s)]
*  You're worse than that group. That's not allowed. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=741.68s)]
*  So in order to allow it, you have to erase Christianity. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=744.68s)]
*  And they've been working on it for a long time. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=748.68s)]
*  Ever notice how they call Martin Luther King doctor but not reverend? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=750.68s)]
*  King was not a physician. He was a Christian preacher. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=754.68s)]
*  They'd like you to forget that. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=757.68s)]
*  Undermining Christianity is the central project of the left because it stands in their way. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=759.68s)]
*  As dozens of churches burned across Canada last summer, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=765.68s)]
*  the country's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=768.68s)]
*  refused to condemn the fire bombings. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=771.68s)]
*  He called them, quote, understandable. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=774.68s)]
*  Then the head of Canada's ACLU effectively endorsed the fire bombings. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=776.68s)]
*  Burn it all down, she wrote. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=781.68s)]
*  And now we're seeing it happen here as we knew it would. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyEm9lw-Gc&t=783.68s)]
