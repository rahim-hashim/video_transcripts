# Tulsi Gabbard: Biden's message is the wrong approach
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw)
*  Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tulsi Gabbard, standing in for Tucker. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=4.64s)]
*  At this point in time, it looks like Republicans are going to take control of the House of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=7.94s)]
*  Representatives while Democrats will hold on to the Senate. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=11.0s)]
*  Now we've spent all week hearing nothing but pundits pontificating on what actually [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=14.84s)]
*  happened in this election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=19.76s)]
*  But if you're like me, you've had enough of that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=20.96s)]
*  It's time for us to talk about what happens next. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=24.16s)]
*  It's time for those who actually got elected to prove to the American people that they're [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=26.64s)]
*  not just politicians, that they actually are there in Washington to take action to protect [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=31.44s)]
*  the interests and freedom of the American people. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=36.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, while in Bali today, instead of delivering a necessary message of unity [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=39.68s)]
*  to all Americans, President Biden chose to attack half the country, once again implying [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  that the only acceptable Democratic outcome is a win for the Democratic Party. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  Let me start with a few words about the recent elections held in the United States. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=55.8s)]
*  What we saw was the strength and resilience of the American democracy, and we saw it in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=60.48s)]
*  action. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=64.0s)]
*  And the American people prove once again that democracy is who we are. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=65.0s)]
*  And there was a strong rejection of election deniers at every level from those seeking [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=69.16s)]
*  to lead our states and those seeking to serve in Congress and also those seeking to oversee [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=73.92s)]
*  the elections. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  And there was a strong rejection of political violence and voter intimidation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=81.6s)]
*  There were no candidates this cycle that were in favor of political violence or voter intimidation [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=87.28s)]
*  or destroying democracy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=91.88s)]
*  Joe Biden's message is the wrong approach. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=94.28s)]
*  Because here's the truth. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=96.6s)]
*  As long as the Democratic Party and the permanent Washington elite are working hand in hand [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=97.96s)]
*  with Google and Facebook, and as long as Google is allowed to continue to use its monopoly [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  to skew public opinion in a certain direction, literally manipulating the information that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=107.44s)]
*  we as voters are allowed to see, then there is no democracy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=112.6s)]
*  A recent study by researchers at North Carolina State University found that Google's email [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=117.24s)]
*  service, Gmail, quote, retained the majority of left-wing candidate emails while sending, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=121.68s)]
*  quote, the majority of right-wing candidate emails to the spam folder. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=128.36s)]
*  Additionally, Google has greatly reduced the visibility of various conservative websites [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=133.08s)]
*  in its search results. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=137.52s)]
*  Breitbart, for example, found that Google has changed its algorithm so that search traffic [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=139.44s)]
*  to Breitbart declined by more than 60%. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=144.32s)]
*  As you can see, these kinds of changes can have a major impact on voting. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=148.36s)]
*  A peer-reviewed 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=153.32s)]
*  found that big search engines like Google can influence the voting preferences of undecided [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=158.76s)]
*  voters by 20% or more. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=164.44s)]
*  We've been hearing a lot of politicians scream and shout about how committed they are to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=169.44s)]
*  defending our democracy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=173.12s)]
*  Stop posturing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=176.12s)]
*  Stop fear-mongering. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=177.28s)]
*  Do something about it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=178.44s)]
*  That's what we need right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  Leaders who are actually serious about working on behalf of their constituents and the American [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=182.0s)]
*  people and finding common sense solutions to the many challenges that we face. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=186.56s)]
*  The reality is the margins of this election across the board are razor thin. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  No matter how things shake out in the next few days with these election results that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=197.28s)]
*  have not yet been announced, Republicans and Democrats will have to find a way to work [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=200.32s)]
*  together if there's any hope of getting anything done. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=205.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, what we're already seeing is both sides hardening their position. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  We the American people cannot afford for Congress to be paralyzed by partisan gridlock for the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=214.76s)]
*  next two years. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  There's too much to be done. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  Every person in Congress should see themselves as an independent who is not beholden to any [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=222.92s)]
*  political party but beholden only to their constituents, the American people, ready and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  willing to work with their colleagues. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=233.38s)]
*  It won't be easy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  It's going to require leadership, courage, respect, and humility. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  When I was a Democrat in Congress and I introduced legislation, I always sought out and was able [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=243.24s)]
*  to find Republicans and Democrats who were willing to work together on actually solving [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  problems. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=252.44s)]
*  It's hard, but it can be done. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=253.44s)]
*  It must be done. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=255.84s)]
*  I'm not advocating bipartisanship just for the sake of bipartisanship. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=257.32s)]
*  It's really about coming together as Americans to work for the best interests of the people [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=262.24s)]
*  that they serve, us, their constituents. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=267.68s)]
*  There are many challenges that we're facing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=271.8s)]
*  Here are a few ways where Congress should make a start. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=274.36s)]
*  First and foremost, we must secure our borders. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=279.72s)]
*  We have to use the power of the purse to close the border and make it crystal clear that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=282.24s)]
*  if you've come into this country illegally through Biden's open door, you got to go back [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=285.94s)]
*  to wherever you came from. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=290.52s)]
*  If you want to come back into our country, you've got to follow our laws. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago, I was in McAllen, Texas, southernmost border, the busiest spot of the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=296.88s)]
*  southern border for illegal crossings, where Congresswoman Myra Flores and her husband, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=302.4s)]
*  a Customs and Border Patrol agent, we walked around and they showed me one of the spots [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=307.56s)]
*  where there's this huge gap in the border wall. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=311.6s)]
*  Later as we were driving out, we saw piles and piles of building materials that were [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=314.64s)]
*  purchased for the wall stacked on the side of the road unused, things that we already [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=319.9s)]
*  paid for. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=325.28s)]
*  So I asked, why aren't they being used? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=326.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, the Biden administration won't allow continued construction of the wall, but they [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=328.0s)]
*  also won't allow the governor of Texas to use those materials again that we already [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=332.26s)]
*  bought to secure their own border. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=336.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, what's happening in McAllen is occurring all along the southern border. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=340.52s)]
*  Fox's Bill Mollusian reported this weekend from Normandy, Texas, as well as Eagle Pass. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=345.4s)]
*  In Normandy, Texas, early Wednesday morning, a massive group of migrants crosses illegally [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=351.56s)]
*  into this tiny town on the outskirts of Eagle Pass, hundreds of them escorted by the Texas [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=356.74s)]
*  National Guard and Border Patrol in a single file line, stretching almost as far as the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=361.98s)]
*  eye can see. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=367.86s)]
*  The migrants are predominantly from countries that Title 42, a policy that allows authorities [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=375.94s)]
*  to expel migrants on the basis of public health, is rarely enforced on, meaning they [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=380.76s)]
*  won't be expelled to Mexico. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=385.56s)]
*  At the same time, another group of 400 crossed illegally into Eagle Pass, most of them single [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=387.88s)]
*  adult men. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=393.48s)]
*  Over the weekend, the White House forced the resignation of the Commissioner of U.S. Customs [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=397.48s)]
*  and Border Protection, Chris Magnus. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  But let's be honest here what this really was. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=403.48s)]
*  It was an effort to shift blame away from those in power who are the ones responsible [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=405.92s)]
*  for over two million people illegally entering our country through the southern border, the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  president, the vice president, and Secretary Mayorkas. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  We can't let them get away with this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=419.04s)]
*  So the question is, is the Biden administration really going to actually change its policy [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=421.02000000000004s)]
*  and make it clear to people around the world that anyone who comes into this country illegally [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  is going to be sent immediately back to where they came from? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=430.6s)]
*  Honestly, I don't have much faith that this is going to happen because if it were, they [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=434.42s)]
*  would have already done it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=440.34s)]
*  There is nothing more important in this country than protecting our God-given rights enshrined [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=442.14s)]
*  in the Constitution. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=447.02s)]
*  These very freedoms and civil liberties, however, are under attack. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=448.98s)]
*  They have been for quite some time. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  This new Congress coming in must take this promise that they make when they take their [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=455.3s)]
*  oath of office seriously to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=459.58s)]
*  together to protect our civil liberties and end the gross overreach of government, get [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  rid of provisions like those in the Patriot Act that allow for secret FISA courts, that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=471.46s)]

*  Now instead of curbing these abuses of power, Congress has enabled them. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=644.58s)]
*  In order to prevent further abuse of power, Congress needs to use the power of the purse [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=649.94s)]
*  and immediately halt the IRS funding of 87,000 new IRS agents that will be harassing everyday [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=655.1400000000001s)]
*  Americans. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=661.7s)]
*  Now the IRS has a troubling history of targeting groups and individuals based on their politics. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=662.7s)]
*  You probably remember IRS Director Lois Lerner specifically targeted conservatives. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=669.46s)]
*  Congress did nothing to hold her accountable. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=674.7800000000001s)]
*  They must take action now before it's too late because the IRS is now already one of [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=677.62s)]
*  the most heavily armed law enforcement agencies in the country. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=682.46s)]
*  In addition to being accountants, we're also law enforcement officers, which is very interesting [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=685.7s)]
*  because a lot of the special agents that work for the IRS, they don't come from a law enforcement [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  background. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=695.0600000000001s)]
*  We get to do the same things like all the other law enforcement officers do. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  Things happen, we have to be able to respond, so we have to be ready. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=699.5s)]
*  So we teach our agents to fire a firearm to be able to shoot. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=702.22s)]
*  We teach them defensive tactics and methods of defending themselves and protecting others [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=706.34s)]
*  as well. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=710.34s)]
*  So they go through that entire process so that not only can they analyze records, but [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=711.34s)]
*  they also have that law enforcement component. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=715.7800000000001s)]
*  We do carry weapons, we carry handcuffs. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=718.26s)]
*  Why in the world do IRS agents need to carry weapons and handcuffs? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=721.62s)]
*  Most of their work concerns civil matters, not apprehending violent criminals. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=727.34s)]
*  Now last but not least, it's important that we remember that foreign policy is domestic [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=733.34s)]
*  policy. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=738.02s)]
*  We have politicians from both political parties who are the permanent Washington elite and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=739.46s)]
*  who must be held accountable for what they're doing with our taxpayer dollars and how they're [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=744.5400000000001s)]
*  undermining our national security as they push us closer and closer to the brink of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=748.14s)]
*  nuclear catastrophe. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=752.98s)]
*  They need to stop giving a blank check to Ukraine and demand accountability for the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=753.98s)]
*  tens of billions of dollars that they've sent so far. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=759.34s)]
*  Because the blank check, it's not just for Ukraine. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=763.14s)]
*  It's for the military industrial complex who's made trillions of dollars off of our wars [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=765.6999999999999s)]
*  in Afghanistan and the Middle East. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=770.4s)]
*  Now the Biden administration, they want to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to go over every [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=773.12s)]
*  receipt and every deductible of American taxpayers with a fine-tooth comb squeezing every penny [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=778.34s)]
*  that they can. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=784.9399999999999s)]
*  The Ukrainian government and their corrupt bureaucrats and oligarchs and the defense [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=786.86s)]
*  contractors who are profiting from all these weapons, the Biden administration requires [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=791.3s)]
*  no receipts at all. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=794.9399999999999s)]
*  Why is this? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=797.68s)]
*  It's because they know that most of this money, our taxpayer dollars, is going to corrupt [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=799.26s)]
*  bureaucrats. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=803.6999999999999s)]
*  They know this. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=805.38s)]
*  Their actions expose who they really care about. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=806.78s)]
*  It's not us. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=808.9799999999999s)]
*  While they're shipping troops and taxpayer dollars overseas and they are continuing to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=810.54s)]
*  do so, this administration and Congress are failing to take care of our veterans and service [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=814.42s)]
*  members. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=819.94s)]
*  As we speak here, we have soldiers who are forced to rely on food stamps to feed their [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=821.3800000000001s)]
*  families, soldiers who are living in uninhabitable conditions, and those who are not getting the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=825.62s)]
*  care that they need for service-related injuries, illnesses, and diseases. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=831.1s)]
*  If the new Congress takes action on all of these areas, if they solve the border crisis, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=837.1400000000001s)]
*  close the border, if they curb Department of Justice abuse of power, if they shut down [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=842.22s)]
*  this new IRS funding for hiring agents and protect civil liberties, end this unconditional [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=846.98s)]
*  endless funding of the war in Ukraine, and protect and take care of our troops and veterans [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=852.7s)]
*  here at home, they will have accomplished meaningful results for the American people. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=856.98s)]
*  That's the right approach, regardless of which party controls Congress. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN5gV9GbCvw&t=862.14s)]
