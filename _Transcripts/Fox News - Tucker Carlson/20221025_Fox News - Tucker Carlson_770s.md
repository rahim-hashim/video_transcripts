# Tucker Carlson: Are the wrong thoughts now illegal?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, what's that sound you hear? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=2.08s)]
*  Oh, it's the sound of America getting a little better. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=3.48s)]
*  You can feel it happening. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=5.96s)]
*  Last time we played you a clip [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=9.28s)]
*  from an unintentionally hilarious MSNBC town hall [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=10.8s)]
*  in which some pompous airhead reporter tries her best [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  to explain to Trump voters [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=16.64s)]
*  why January 6th actually was an insurrection. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=18.84s)]
*  An insurrection in which only the police had guns [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  inside the Capitol. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=25.46s)]
*  An insurrection in which the police welcomed [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  the insurrectionists inside the building [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=27.92s)]
*  to insurrect, quite an insurrection. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=29.88s)]
*  Of course, an insurrection that went nowhere [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=32.28s)]
*  where the leader was dressed in Viking horns [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=34.32s)]
*  and eating psilocybin mushrooms. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=37.24s)]
*  So we thought it was pretty funny. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=39.2s)]
*  What we didn't note though last night [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=40.2s)]
*  was the moment where that airhead reporter claims [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=42.24s)]
*  that a police officer was killed by the mob that day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=44.64s)]
*  Now, if you watch television, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=48.24s)]
*  you've heard that line so many times, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=49.24s)]
*  so many times that you may not even notice [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=51.04s)]
*  when people say it anymore. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=53.0s)]
*  They've been saying it constantly for nearly two years. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=54.16s)]
*  Police officers were killed, many of them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Why are they saying that? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=60.8s)]
*  It's not true, it's provably a lie. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  It is in no sense accurate. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=64.52s)]
*  No police officer was killed by the mob on January 6th. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  Anyone who claims otherwise is always welcome [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=69.96s)]
*  on this show live to explain who exactly was killed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=72.39999999999999s)]
*  What's that officer's name and how was he killed? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  We didn't expect any takers on that offer. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=79.0s)]
*  So the question is, why do they keep telling us that? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=82.24s)]
*  Well, there's a reason, there's always a reason. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=85.0s)]
*  They're telling us that likely [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  so we won't ask too many questions [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=88.24s)]
*  the next time we read about yet another [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=89.76s)]
*  January 6th protester going to jail. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=91.28s)]
*  We'll just think, oh, another cop killer [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=93.52s)]
*  getting what he deserves. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=95.28s)]
*  That's what they're hoping you will think. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=97.28s)]
*  And they're hoping that because if you knew the truth, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  if you knew why they're really going to jail, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=101.12s)]
*  you'd be very concerned. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=102.68s)]
*  And here is the truth. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden's Justice Department is imprisoning people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=105.92s)]
*  for having the wrong thoughts, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=108.8s)]
*  thoughts that we all imagined [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=110.48s)]
*  were constitutionally protected, as all thoughts are. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=111.76s)]
*  But don't take our word for it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  That's not just a right-wing talking point [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=116.32s)]
*  on a cable channel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  You can read the court filings in January 6th cases [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  over the past year and a half. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  And in virtually every instance, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=124.24s)]
*  federal prosecutors argue in public [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=125.88s)]
*  that the political views of the defendants, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=128.28s)]
*  not anything they actually did, not crimes they committed, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=130.4s)]
*  but instead their personal beliefs, what they think, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=133.72s)]
*  those beliefs are reason enough to put them behind bars. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  According to Joe Biden's DOJ, for example, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=141.28s)]
*  Army veteran Jessica Watkins needed to be detained [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=143.64s)]
*  indefinitely because she had, quote, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=147.16s)]
*  extremist and violent views regarding how to address [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=148.84s)]
*  what she believed to be a fraudulent election. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, she was an extremist. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=154.12s)]
*  It's a term they never explained, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  but that apparently is now a crime. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=158.44s)]
*  So we decide what extremist means, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  and then we put you in jail for being one. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  That's how that works. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  UCLA student Christian Secor, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  that was the guy who sat in Mike Pence's chair [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=167.12s)]
*  on January 6th, is now in prison. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=169.08s)]
*  And he should be in prison, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  explained the Biden administration's lawyers, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=173.28s)]
*  because he had, quote, extremist beliefs, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=175.56s)]
*  and a, quote, history of adhering to extremist ideology. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=178.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  Again, you decide what extremist is, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  and then put me in prison for being one. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=183.88s)]
*  In the case of Robert Morse, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=186.44s)]
*  that was the guy who was busted in possession [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=187.6s)]
*  of a Lego set of the Capitol. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  The DOJ put it this way, quote, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  it is difficult to fathom a more serious danger [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=193.92s)]
*  to the community than someone who tried to, quote, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=196.48s)]
*  abort the certification of a lawful and fair election, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=199.28s)]
*  end quote, it's the one kind of abortion they don't favor, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=202.92s)]
*  the aborting of a fair and free election. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=205.64s)]
*  So in every case though, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  the defendant's real crime was not aborting an election. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=210.84s)]
*  No, the real crime, and the DOJ says it right in the filings, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=213.4s)]
*  is denying the outcome of the election. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  It was believing the wrong thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=220.76s)]
*  It was not believing that a senile man [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=223.2s)]
*  who refused to leave his basement during the campaign [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=225.44s)]
*  somehow got more votes than any president [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=227.56s)]
*  in American history. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=230.04s)]
*  If you refuse to believe that, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=230.88s)]
*  you're now a felon. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=232.76s)]
*  Question the system and they haul you away. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  Those are the rules now, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  as hundreds of imprisoned Republicans [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=239.88s)]
*  can personally testify if they could speak. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=242.32s)]
*  So the legal precedent has been established. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=245.48s)]
*  You cannot deny elections. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=248.92s)]
*  And yet even in the face of the mounting evidence, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=251.32s)]
*  this is now a very serious felony, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=253.68s)]
*  there are some extremists who are not deterred. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=255.12s)]
*  They're continuing to commit the crime of election denial, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=257.08s)]
*  and they're bold enough to do it on video. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=260.44s)]
*  Here, ladies and gentlemen, is one of them. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=262.88s)]
*  I know we're all focused on the 2022 midterm elections, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=265.64s)]
*  and they are incredibly important. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=269.32s)]
*  But we also have to look ahead, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=273.12s)]
*  because you know what? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=275.52s)]
*  Our opponents certainly are. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=276.84s)]
*  Right-wing extremists already have a plan [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=279.44s)]
*  to literally steal the next presidential election. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  And they're not making a secret of it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  The right-wing controlled Supreme Court [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=289.88s)]
*  may be poised to rule on giving state legislatures, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  yes, you heard me that correctly, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=297.88s)]
*  state legislatures the power [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=300.32s)]

*  Did you hear that? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=307.08s)]
*  Right-wing extremists will literally, literally, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=308.28s)]
*  must teach that word in NPR, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=312.32s)]
*  literally steal the next election. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=313.52s)]
*  So that's preemptive election denial, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  committed by Hillary Clinton herself. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=319.12s)]
*  But here's the thing, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=321.76s)]
*  probably not likely that an FBI SWAT team [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=322.96s)]
*  is gonna show up at Hillary Clinton's house [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  when she's in the shower tomorrow morning. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=327.44s)]
*  And in fact, the next time a courthouse is attacked [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=329.68s)]
*  in Portland, Oregon, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=331.92s)]
*  or a church is torched in downtown Washington, DC, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=333.24s)]
*  it's unlikely that a DOJ court filing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=337.0s)]
*  will cite what Hillary Clinton just said [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=339.12s)]
*  as an extremist ideology that led to violence. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=341.24s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=344.76s)]
*  Well, because in the considered opinion [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=345.58s)]
*  of the Democratic Party and the DOJ, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=347.96s)]
*  it's not election denial when they do it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=350.44s)]
*  No, it's just election-affirming care. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=352.84s)]
*  And there's been a lot of election-affirming care [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=356.56s)]
*  going around these past few weeks. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=358.85999999999996s)]
*  In Washington, in the Hometown newspaper, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=360.91999999999996s)]
*  owned by Jeff Bezos, the Washington Post, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  Max Boot just announced that, we're quoting, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  "'If the current trends hold up, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  Republicans are likely to take over at least the House [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=370.08s)]
*  and quite possibly the Senate too, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  along with many state offices. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=374.64s)]
*  This is how democracies die, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=376.64s)]

*  unlike dictatorship, does not always come to the conclusion [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  that you favor. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=392.15999999999997s)]

*  Democracy dies in both darkness [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=397.2s)]

*  Oh, okay. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=403.08s)]
*  New York Magazine isn't waiting around [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=405.88s)]
*  for the next election. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=409.03999999999996s)]

*  "'There are already signs of 2020 election deniers [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  refusing to accept their own possible defeat this year.'" [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=414.4s)]
*  And that's half true, of course, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=417.84s)]
*  but New York Magazine isn't talking about Republicans. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=419.18s)]
*  Quote, "'Most observers are primarily worried [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=421.32s)]
*  that Trump's 2020 shenanigans may have served [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=423.52s)]

*  Wait, what? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=427.88s)]
*  So that means you have Democrats [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  two years before the presidential election [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=433.2s)]
*  telling us that that election is going to be rigged. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=435.32s)]
*  But that's not undermining confidence in elections? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=438.84s)]
*  That's not an attack on our sacred norms? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=442.32s)]
*  Not when it happens in New York Magazine or at PBS, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=445.76s)]
*  which by the way, you continue to fund with your tax dollars, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=448.36s)]

*  The people who watch PBS are the ones [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=453.48s)]
*  who are stuck in traction [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  and the attendants going out for a cigarette [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=456.84s)]
*  and taking the remote, but they're still broadcasting. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=458.4s)]
*  And here's what they're saying, quote, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=461.12s)]
*  "'Nearly one in three Republican candidates [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=462.28s)]

*  So why aren't they in prison? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=468.96s)]
*  And what is the end game of these dangerous extremists [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=470.2s)]
*  led by Donald Trump? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=472.08s)]
*  Well, Vanity Fair figured it out. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=472.91999999999996s)]

*  but we do know how he's gonna do it [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=504.84s)]

*  Donald Trump is gonna do that as he always has done it [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=508.73999999999995s)]
*  with help from Vladimir Putin himself. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=511.35999999999996s)]

*  We know the Russians hacked the DNC, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=515.16s)]

*  January 6th defendants are being sentenced to prison [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=571.56s)]

*  how it is that Joe Biden got 15 million more votes [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=575.48s)]

*  How did that work? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=590.78s)]
*  How did Joe Biden get more votes [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=592.5s)]
*  than any president in American history? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=594.38s)]

*  No, it's not, it's a crime to ask. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=597.8199999999999s)]
*  And yet no one bats an eye when Hillary Clinton tells us [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=599.6999999999999s)]
*  that Putin is literally going to steal the election. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=601.96s)]
*  So how is it that only one side [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=606.62s)]

*  we get the sense based on polling [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=642.36s)]
*  that we're about to be spanked [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=643.7199999999999s)]
*  like the bad little girls we are, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=644.92s)]
*  at which point we start making excuses [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=646.24s)]
*  and planting the seeds for more election denial, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=649.04s)]
*  just as we did after Donald Trump won. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=651.8s)]
*  That's exactly what's going on now. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  Even as they try to destroy the careers [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=656.1999999999999s)]
*  and tear down the character of people [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=659.92s)]
*  who ask honest questions about the last election, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=661.5999999999999s)]
*  that would include Ron Johnson, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=664.16s)]
*  who is the Senator from Wisconsin, the Republican. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=666.16s)]
*  One of the very few Republicans in the entire US Senate [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  who has actually improved every year that he served there. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  That's the opposite of the normal progression [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=675.04s)]
*  for Republicans in the Senate, in case you haven't noticed. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=676.8399999999999s)]
*  Now, Ron Johnson is running against someone [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  who's legitimately far out. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=681.0799999999999s)]
*  His name is Mandela Barnes. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=683.0s)]
*  On Twitter, Barnes once rang in the new year by praising, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=684.6s)]
*  and few politicians do this, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=687.48s)]
*  by praising Iran's Ayatollah [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  because he supports BLM. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=692.44s)]
*  I'm work voting. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=694.36s)]
*  The first tweet of 2015 from at Kameni IR [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=695.6s)]
*  is Black Lives Matter. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=699.84s)]
*  Let that sink in. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=701.0s)]
*  May this be a most wonderful year for you and yours, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=702.64s)]
*  Barnes wrote. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=705.44s)]
*  So he's got the Ayatollah vote. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=706.84s)]
*  Barnes also wants to abolish ICE, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=708.48s)]
*  defund the police, and end cash bail. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=710.6s)]
*  So that would result in further chaos [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=713.08s)]
*  and the total destruction of American society. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=715.28s)]
*  Might be worth following up on that. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=717.04s)]
*  But no, the media in Wisconsin are still talking about [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=719.04s)]
*  Ron Johnson's election denial. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=721.8s)]
*  Here's his hometown newspaper, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=724.16s)]
*  which no one reads in fairness, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=725.9599999999999s)]
*  attacking him the other day for it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=727.5999999999999s)]
*  Quote, election deceiver, science fabulous, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  billionaire benefactor. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=732.04s)]
*  After 12 years, it's time to turn limit, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=733.4799999999999s)]
*  Senator Ron Johnson. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=735.64s)]
*  So again, just to be clear, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=737.64s)]
*  Democrats are sending people to prison [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=739.88s)]
*  for questioning the last election, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=741.8s)]
*  trying to prevent people from getting elected [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=743.24s)]
*  in the midterm election for questioning the last election [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=745.28s)]
*  while at the very same time telling you [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=747.8s)]
*  that the 2016 election was rigged, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=750.12s)]
*  the midterm will likely be rigged, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=752.2s)]
*  and we know for a fact the 2024 election [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=753.8s)]
*  is not on the level. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=756.36s)]
*  How does this work exactly? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwErp9QEYqE&t=758.24s)]
