**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng)

*  A major college campus erupted into violence [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=2.64s)]
*  when someone tried to say things [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=5.74s)]
*  that were not approved by the people in charge, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration and Apple. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=9.42s)]
*  That happened last night [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=10.76s)]
*  at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=11.72s)]
*  Charlie Kirk visited the campus [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=13.56s)]

*  You like white supremacy, yeah? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=55.519999999999996s)]

*  F***! [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=61.68000000000001s)]

*  You like the police! [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=69.68s)]
*  Oh, but the threat is the Proud Boys and QAnon. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=70.68s)]
*  Charlie Kirk is the founder and president of Turning Point USA. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=72.68s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=75.0s)]
*  Charlie, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=76.0s)]
*  This was clearly organized. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=77.26s)]
*  A lot of the signs were pre-printed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=78.26s)]
*  Who were these people, do you know? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  I wonder if they're paid and why they were spending their evenings to protest me and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  our Turning Point USA chapter just to talk about the U.S. Constitution and freedom of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=87.34s)]
*  speech. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=91.42s)]
*  It's really interesting when you try to show up on a college campus and do an optional [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=92.42s)]
*  voluntary event, how angry the other side gets. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=95.14s)]
*  But this is a very important moment for people to recognize and understand that the other [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  side, the left, the radical left, they're acting like the very same domestic violent [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=102.56s)]
*  extremists that the entire federal government is now organized to go after. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  And we're told that's on the American right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=110.94000000000001s)]
*  Really go look at that footage. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=112.66000000000001s)]
*  Is that the Proud Boys? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=113.98s)]
*  Is that the American right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=114.98s)]
*  Are those conservatives? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=115.98s)]
*  No. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=117.78s)]
*  Those people are on the left. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=118.78s)]
*  And I wonder who's financing them and who's behind it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=119.78s)]
*  This is the third time this semester that we've done an event on this campus. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=120.78s)]
*  The other two had to be canceled or ended abruptly because of these people that intervened. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  So I went there on a personal mission because the only way we lose right now is if we don't [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=128.46s)]
*  show up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=133.22s)]
*  So I went there last evening to send a message to every one of these people, to send a message [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=134.22s)]
*  to the one that's watching, that we're going to stand for free speech and you are not going [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=137.94s)]
*  to be able to disrupt our events or bully our students with force. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=141.18s)]
*  And thankfully the event went very well despite their best protest and their violence. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=145.26s)]
*  Three people were arrested last evening. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=150.5s)]
*  But I noticed their signs are so familiar. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  You're a racist. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=154.66s)]
*  You're a white supremacist. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=155.66s)]
*  I happen to know that you argue when you even address race for a colorblind society, which [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=156.66s)]
*  is of course the opposite in the antidote to racism. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=161.14s)]
*  Why is it always that slur? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=163.89999999999998s)]
*  I mean, there are probably things you believe that they don't think could attack you on [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=165.38s)]
*  those, but no, they called you a white supremacist and they always do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=170.54s)]
*  Well, first of all, because most people cower in fear when they're called a racist. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=171.98s)]
*  They go into a place of paralysis. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=176.14s)]
*  We are in the era of weaponized name calling where people ask for forgiveness immediately [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=178.14s)]
*  and they apologize for no reason just because they're called this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=184.0s)]
*  But there's another reason. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=186.76s)]
*  It's because the modern left, the postmodern left, they don't believe in speech. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=187.98s)]
*  They don't believe you're an individual made in the image of God. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=191.34s)]
*  They believe you are a member of a collective identity group. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=193.54s)]
*  And they believe that they can then shut us up just by calling us white supremacists and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=196.82s)]
*  racists. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=201.34s)]
*  I invited every single one of them to come into our event and they could have the microphone [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=202.34s)]
*  and make their case. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=206.3s)]
*  But they do not believe that speech is a value. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=207.74s)]
*  All they care about is force and power. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=210.46s)]
*  This is the country they're trying to lead us towards. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=212.94s)]
*  What happened in Albuquerque yesterday is not an aberration. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  It is a coming attraction. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=218.94s)]
*  It is something that is soon going to happen all across the country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=221.34s)]
*  If we don't get this right, we win when we show up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=223.94s)]
*  And one last thing I'll say is despite everything the media has said over the last couple of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  weeks about Gen Z, the good news is that over the last five years, young people have become [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=230.06s)]
*  13 points less liberal, according to the Morning Consult. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=235.74s)]
*  I don't think that the behavior yesterday is popular, nor do I think it's emblematic [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=239.18s)]
*  of an entire generation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7jP-kzu0ng&t=243.3s)]
