# Abortion is religion for the far left: Hawley
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E)
*  So what does it mean to leak a draft Supreme Court decision? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, of course, it's an attack on the judiciary [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=4.68s)]
*  and an attack on the rule of law. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=6.96s)]
*  It's leveraging the mob to short circuit [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=8.72s)]
*  our democratic institutions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=11.6s)]
*  It's an attempt to intimidate Supreme Court justices [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=14.0s)]
*  into reversing course. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Are we for that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=19.48s)]
*  Well, Congresswoman Pramila Payapal just tweeted this, quote, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=20.96s)]
*  the purpose of our Supreme Court is to uphold freedom [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=25.6s)]
*  not to take away fundamental freedom for women [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=28.96s)]
*  to make choices about our bodies and futures. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=31.8s)]
*  And then she's an expert on the Constitution, apparently. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=35.28s)]
*  Then she called on people to, quote, take to the streets, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=37.84s)]
*  in other words, to commit violence, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=40.36s)]
*  to intimidate the Supreme Court into doing what she wants. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=41.52s)]
*  Not in this country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=44.84s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Senator Josh Hawley understands exactly what's going on here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=47.32s)]
*  He clerked on the Supreme Court for John Roberts, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=49.92s)]
*  and we're happy to have him join us tonight. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=51.88s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for coming out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  So you have a sitting member of Congress [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=54.56s)]
*  threatening Supreme Court justices with a mob [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=56.68s)]
*  if they don't do what she wants. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=59.72s)]
*  That seems very dangerous to me. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=61.0s)]
*  You know, what it is, Tucker, is abortion is religion [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=64.36s)]
*  for the far left, and they are willing to do anything [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=67.16s)]
*  to defend that religion and to force it on everybody else. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=69.92s)]
*  And that's why they're willing to burn down the court [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=73.28s)]
*  as an institution. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=75.28s)]
*  You know, they're only for the institution [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=76.2s)]
*  if it does exactly what they say it should do. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=77.48s)]
*  And let's be clear what Roe really says. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=80.04s)]
*  What Roe really says is that the people are too stupid [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=82.0s)]
*  to make these decisions for themselves. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=84.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=85.84s)]
*  The people can't be trusted to actually vote [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=86.68s)]
*  and deliberate and make tough moral choices. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=88.36s)]
*  It says, oh, no, no, no, nine justices wearing robes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=90.84s)]
*  They should be the ones making all the decisions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  That's not what the Constitution says though, Tucker. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=95.4s)]
*  And that's why we need to get back to trusting the people [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=97.84s)]
*  and actually enforcing the Constitution. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=102.64s)]
*  I mean, I have really strong feelings on this subject. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=103.56s)]
*  I would be absolutely happy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=105.44s)]
*  In fact, I hope that we can put this up for a vote [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  in the United States Congress, in the House and the Senate, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=109.2s)]
*  and we can determine what the people want to do [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=112.2s)]
*  about abortion. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=115.04s)]
*  Why is that a scary option? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's not scary, it's democracy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  And this is about whether or not democracy [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  is gonna have its day. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  Supposedly, Joe Biden believes in democracy, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  and yet today you heard him, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  and he was saying that this is too important [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=128.12s)]
*  to be trusted to the whims of the people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=129.96s)]
*  I mean, you mean actually the voters, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=131.56s)]
*  you mean the people who elected you, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=132.84s)]
*  the sovereigns of this nation? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=134.6s)]
*  I mean, that's what we're talking about here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=136.44s)]
*  So what the court should do, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=138.16s)]
*  and what this opinion does do, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=139.68s)]
*  is that it puts democracy back in the driver's seat. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  And I hope the court will stick with it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=144.4s)]
*  They can't turn back now, Tucker, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  in the face of this pressure. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  Everyone I've talked to today is afraid [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=148.6s)]
*  that there's gonna be violence from the left. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  Is there a certain point where the country, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=152.16s)]
*  normal people, even Democrats, say, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=153.56s)]
*  you know, you're not allowed to intimidate the public [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=154.76s)]
*  into doing your will. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=157.84s)]
*  We have a system, democratic norms, remember the phrase? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=158.96s)]
*  And we're, you know, stop this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=161.84s)]
*  You can't intimidate us anymore. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=163.24s)]
*  Is someone gonna say that at some point? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=164.52s)]
*  I hope so, because we are at that point. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=166.84s)]
*  I mean, the idea that you could go out there [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=168.68s)]
*  and threaten these justices, which Chuck Schumer has done, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=170.68s)]
*  by name, threaten them by name over abortion. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=173.16s)]
*  And now you see all of these other congressmen [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  and senators doing the same thing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  They're just trying to hijack the institution [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=179.24s)]
*  to get their religion forced on everybody else. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=181.8s)]
*  I mean, it is time for the American people [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  to actually have a say. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=186.6s)]
*  What a concept, the American people have a say [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  in their own government, in their own laws. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  That's what we're talking about here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's what this fight is about. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=193.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's people with federally-funded bodyguards [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=194.88s)]
*  threatening others. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=197.28s)]
*  It's just, it's unbelievable. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=198.12s)]
*  Senator Josh Hawley, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=201.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdryA28BC4E&t=202.76s)]
