# Tucker: What is a woman?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=0.0s)]
*  In the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee asked Joe Biden's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=5.2s)]
*  Supreme Court nominee, Contangi Jackson, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=7.92s)]
*  what should have been the easiest question ever posed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  Can you define what a woman is? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=14.06s)]
*  Now imagine, put yourself in her position [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=16.8s)]
*  and imagine how relieved Jackson must have been [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=18.64s)]
*  when she heard that question. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=21.16s)]
*  Here she stayed up all night trying to memorize [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=22.66s)]
*  obscure case law from the 19th century and court precedent. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=25.04s)]
*  And when she finally gets to the hearing room, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=28.72s)]
*  all the Republicans want is a recap [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=30.92s)]
*  of day one of ninth grade biology. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=33.0s)]
*  What's a woman? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=34.48s)]
*  For a world famous scholar like Contangi Jackson, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=36.08s)]
*  that should have been effortless. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=38.76s)]
*  Talk about slow and steady right down the plate. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=39.88s)]
*  A woman, Jackson might have said, looking incredulous. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=41.6s)]
*  That's simple. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=45.08s)]
*  A woman is a human being with two X chromosomes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=46.32s)]
*  Ask any geneticist. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  It's detectable in a blood test. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=50.04s)]
*  But if you're still confused by what a woman is, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=52.3s)]
*  you can ask a doctor. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=54.32s)]
*  Women have wider pelvises and different bone structures [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  from men, not to mention very different genitalia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=58.56s)]
*  It's usually pretty obvious that women, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=61.28s)]
*  just by looking at them, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  women are built differently because their bodies [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=64.12s)]
*  are designed to do different things. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=66.28s)]
*  Nature is real. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=68.04s)]
*  Women menstruate, women give birth and then breastfeed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=69.52s)]
*  Men do not do these things because they can't. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=72.2s)]
*  Not a single man in all human history [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=75.2s)]
*  has ever had his period or delivered a baby. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  And I know this Senator because I'm a woman myself. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=79.56s)]
*  In fact, that's why I'm here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=83.1s)]
*  Joe Biden nominated me to the Supreme Court [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=84.64s)]
*  because I am female and he has said so himself many times. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=86.56s)]
*  The president knows exactly what a woman is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  If he didn't know, he wouldn't have picked me, obviously. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  So please, Senator Blackburn, do not waste my time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=96.88s)]
*  With all respect, that is an incredibly stupid question. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=99.58s)]
*  Imagine if she said that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  What an answer that would have been. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  Do you know a single person wouldn't have cheered? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  We would have. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=108.6s)]
*  Honesty is a wonderful thing to watch [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=109.92s)]
*  no matter where it comes from. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=111.92s)]
*  But that is not what Contangi Jackson said. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=113.76s)]
*  Here was her actual answer. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=116.64s)]
*  Can you provide a definition for the word woman? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=118.76s)]
*  Can I provide a definition? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm, yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=125.48s)]
*  I can't. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=127.42s)]
*  You can't? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=128.8s)]
*  Not in this context. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=131.76s)]
*  I'm not a biologist. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=133.76s)]
*  Ooh, I'm not a biologist. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=135.6s)]
*  You following this? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=137.0s)]
*  So only a biologist is allowed to tell you what a woman is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=137.88s)]
*  and Contangi Jackson incredibly impressive [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  as they tell us she is, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  is not, she just reminded us, a biologist. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Not that it would make any difference [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=148.16s)]
*  if she were a biologist, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  because no one in the Democratic Party cares [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=150.2s)]
*  what biologists think about biological sex. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=151.76s)]
*  Biologists have been banned along with a lady [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=154.14s)]
*  who writes Harry Potter novels. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=156.04s)]
*  In 2022, the power of science and literature [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=157.94s)]
*  crumble in the face of the trans lobby. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=160.61999999999998s)]
*  So actually, Contangi Jackson's academic credentials [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=164.04s)]
*  are not strictly speaking all that relevant here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=167.27999999999997s)]
*  But still, pause for a second [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=169.7s)]
*  and marinate in the awe-inspiring stupidity of her answer. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=172.34s)]
*  What's a woman? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=177.02s)]
*  I don't know, I'm not a biologist. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=177.86s)]
*  Oh, we see how this works. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=179.46s)]
*  Hey, Contangi Jackson, is it raining? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=181.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=183.3s)]
*  I'm not a meteorologist. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=184.26s)]
*  How would you respond to someone [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  who said something like that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  You'd probably give up and find someone else to talk to. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=188.86s)]
*  That person was not capable of conversation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=191.36s)]
*  So last night we said we wanted to see [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=194.02s)]
*  Contangi Jackson's LSAT scores, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=196.06s)]
*  but that's no longer necessary. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=198.06s)]
*  We can say with certainty she is clearly a subgenius [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=199.42000000000002s)]
*  and probably shouldn't be on the Supreme Court. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=201.86s)]
*  What's a woman? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=204.78s)]
*  Definitely the most revealing question ever asked [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  in a Senate confirmation hearing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=209.02s)]
*  And one of the many things it reveals [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  is how utterly the Democratic Party as an institution [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=213.62s)]
*  has changed in just four years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=216.34s)]
*  It's a mile marker that tells us the evolution of the party. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=218.02s)]
*  So during the last Supreme Court nomination, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=221.78000000000003s)]
*  you'll remember, we were commanded to believe [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=224.02s)]
*  that all women must be believed [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  regardless of whether or not they were telling the truth. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=229.7s)]
*  They're women. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=232.46s)]
*  Therefore, in the name of social justice, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=233.28s)]
*  you must accept whatever they say at face value. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=234.66s)]
*  A woman's word is like a sworn affidavit. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=237.9s)]
*  You can take it to the bank. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=240.7s)]
*  Here's Kamala Harris to explain. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=242.46s)]
*  Let's speak truth about what we've all been talking [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  about the last few days and again this evening, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=247.96s)]
*  which is that Supreme Court process. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=250.84s)]
*  Let's speak the truth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=253.82s)]
*  It was a sham. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=255.14s)]
*  And a disgrace. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's speak the truth that it was a denial of justice [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  for the women of this country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=262.86s)]
*  How amusing is it to see Kamala Harris say, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=266.86s)]
*  let's speak the truth. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=269.62s)]
*  Throw a beer can at the TV if you agree. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=271.06s)]
*  So to recap, in 2019, it was quote, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=273.74s)]
*  a sham and a disgrace to doubt a woman's word [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=277.62s)]
*  because women's words are so much more important [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=280.58000000000004s)]
*  than the words of the people. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=283.82000000000005s)]

*  That's what it was to be a woman, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=289.74s)]
*  utterly truthful all the time. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=292.06s)]
*  Joe Biden agreed with this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=295.14s)]
*  Women were very different from men. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=296.38s)]
*  Inherently, he told us so. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=298.46s)]
*  And that's why you weren't allowed to hit them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=300.5s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=302.26s)]
*  We in fact have to fundamentally change the culture, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=303.62s)]
*  the culture of how women are treated. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=307.22s)]
*  No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=309.96s)]
*  other than in self-defense, and that's rarely ever occurs. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=315.52s)]
*  And so we have to just change the culture, period, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=319.28s)]
*  and keep punching at it and punching at it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=322.12s)]
*  and punching at it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  All right, so we mocked him. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=327.32s)]
*  Keep punching at it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  Domestic abuse, that is. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=330.0s)]
*  We made fun of him, but he was onto something. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=330.88s)]
*  Actually, what he said was entirely true. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  Ask yourself, two men get in a bar fight, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=334.4s)]
*  one of them punches the other in the face. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=338.7s)]
*  Come on, guys, take it outside. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=340.08s)]
*  A man and a woman get in a bar fight, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  the man punches the woman in the face. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=343.64s)]

*  Well, if you're a normal human being, you're horrified. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=348.64s)]
*  Punching a woman in the face is not just a felony, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=351.24s)]
*  though it is, it is a moral crime. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=353.28s)]
*  Decent people don't punch women in the face, period. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  A man's best instinct is to protect women. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=361.76s)]
*  That's nothing to be ashamed of. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  It makes a civilization civilized. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=367.24s)]
*  That's why we don't send expectant mothers into battle. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=370.06s)]
*  Got that, you degraded freaks? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=374.56s)]
*  Pregnant flight suits are an attempt to make us deny [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=376.36s)]

*  Joe Biden had this instinct, he noted it, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=384.44s)]
*  he was absolutely right. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=386.04s)]
*  Why was he right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  Because men and women are not the same. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=388.24s)]
*  When I say one is morally better than the other, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  they're morally equal, but they're different [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  on the deepest levels, beginning with biology. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=394.48s)]
*  Every person on earth knows this is true. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  We were born knowing it, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=399.48s)]

*  deny nature and suppress your most basic [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=404.56s)]
*  and valuable instincts. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=407.52s)]
*  They're telling you you have no right to be more upset [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=409.72s)]
*  when a woman is injured, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=413.2s)]
*  or a woman gets her ear bitten off in a bar fight [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=414.46s)]

*  that won't acknowledge them? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=421.54s)]
*  What happens to our justice system [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=422.8s)]
*  if we pretend men and women are exactly the same [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=424.1s)]
*  or don't exist? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=425.6s)]

*  and who's a woman will transform the way [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=429.62s)]
*  starting with our vast regime of anti-discrimination law. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=432.04s)]
*  If we can't say for certain who's a woman, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  how are we gonna enforce Joe Biden's famous [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=438.98s)]
*  Violence Against Women Act? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=441.12s)]
*  Why do we have such an act? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=442.36s)]
*  Who would care? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=443.68s)]
*  How can we set aside a huge percentage of federal contracts [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=445.32000000000005s)]

*  Oh, I guess that scam's gonna have to end tomorrow [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=451.06s)]

*  And by the way, how is sexism even a meaningful category [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=454.94000000000005s)]
*  in a world in which sex has no meaning? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=458.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's not. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=460.46s)]
*  Why have Title IX, which bans sex discrimination in schools? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=462.02s)]
*  If we don't have biological sex, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=465.14s)]
*  how can we have discrimination [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=466.7s)]
*  on the basis of biological sex? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=468.06s)]
*  Thinking this through? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=469.64s)]
*  The Trump administration thought it through. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=470.8s)]
*  Actually, they saw this coming. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=472.18s)]
*  We should tell you that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=473.28s)]
*  The Trump White House tried to preserve Title IX [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=474.6s)]
*  by arguing that the concept of sex as defined in that law [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=477.08s)]
*  derives from biology, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=480.08s)]
*  not from how you're feeling about your personal identity [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=481.52s)]
*  on any particular day. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=483.88s)]
*  That's the case they made. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=484.82s)]
*  In response to that, they were denounced [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=486.22s)]
*  as right-wing lunatics. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=487.62s)]
*  The ACLU declared that, quote, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=488.52s)]
*  the Trump administration is trying to erase trans people. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=490.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=494.3s)]
*  Maybe it was bigger than that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=495.14000000000004s)]
*  Now, the Biden administration is in charge of everything, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=497.20000000000005s)]
*  and in less than a year, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=499.24s)]
*  the worst, most fervid predictions have come entirely true. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  Female athletes are losing NCAA championships [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=505.16s)]
*  to men dressing up as women [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=508.68s)]
*  in order to cheat their way to victory. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=510.18s)]
*  Every person in America sees this happening. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=513.28s)]
*  Very few are brave enough to say a word about it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  But here's one of them. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=519.78s)]
*  This is a woman who happened to be watching [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=521.0799999999999s)]
*  an NCAA swimming championship [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=522.8399999999999s)]
*  in which a male swimmer going by the name of Leah Thomas [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=524.48s)]
*  dominated every woman in the pool. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=527.02s)]
*  I'm a woman. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=530.9s)]
*  That is not a woman. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=531.74s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=532.5799999999999s)]
*  That is not a woman. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=533.42s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=534.26s)]
*  Do you have ovaries? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=535.92s)]
*  Yeah, go on, then ask me a question. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=536.92s)]
*  What's that? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=538.22s)]
*  A big question. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=539.06s)]
*  Are you a male? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=539.9s)]
*  Are you a male? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=540.72s)]
*  Are you a female? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=541.56s)]
*  Oh my God, don't be ridiculous. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=542.4s)]
*  No, I'm not a vet, but I know what a dog is. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=544.5799999999999s)]

*  Even Contangi Jackson knows. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=556.3000000000001s)]
*  She's had a few children of her own. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=558.1800000000001s)]
*  She probably learned exactly how the process works. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=559.46s)]
*  The point of the trans movement isn't to convince anyone [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=563.0200000000001s)]

*  That's an impossible case to make. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=568.58s)]
*  You would sound ridiculous if you tried to articulate that, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=570.74s)]
*  much less explain it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=573.94s)]
*  The point of this exercise is very different. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=575.48s)]
*  The point is to make the rest of us repeat a lie. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=578.26s)]
*  To say something we know perfectly well is not true. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=581.86s)]
*  Yes, Leah Thomas is a proud, beautiful woman [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=585.1s)]
*  who won the swim meet because she practiced harder [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=587.62s)]
*  than the other girls. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=590.1s)]
*  Leah Thomas deserved to win. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=591.26s)]
*  Her victory wasn't cheating. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=593.22s)]
*  And no, I don't notice her bulging swimsuit. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=594.54s)]
*  I have no idea what you're talking about. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=596.66s)]
*  That's what they demand you say. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=599.42s)]
*  Not because they care about Leah Thomas [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=601.02s)]
*  or any other trans person, they could care less. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=603.02s)]
*  Making you pretend to believe something you don't, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=607.3s)]
*  that's the point. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=610.62s)]
*  Because if they can make you pretend to believe something [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=611.74s)]
*  you know is untrue, they've won. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=614.5799999999999s)]
*  They control your brain. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=616.8599999999999s)]
*  So this isn't about trans people. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=618.8599999999999s)]
*  It's about all of us and the stakes are very high. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's why the censorship is so intense. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=624.38s)]
*  Have you noticed? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=626.4799999999999s)]
*  Our national conversation about transgenderism [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=627.74s)]
*  is completely defined by censorship, by making you shut up. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=630.02s)]
*  Not allowing you to notice the obvious [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=633.88s)]
*  is why they're doing it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=635.9s)]
*  There's no attempt to persuade you. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=637.42s)]
*  There's no fact-based argument. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=638.86s)]
*  You can't respond, oh, so men can become women [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=641.06s)]
*  just by wishing it so? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=644.14s)]
*  Tell us how that works. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=645.14s)]
*  Can I stop male pattern baldness the same way? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=646.38s)]
*  Can I grow six inches? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=648.74s)]
*  Please explain how this remarkable new power [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  the trans community has discovered might apply to me. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=652.26s)]
*  Can I do it too? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=655.04s)]
*  The power of positive thinking. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=656.54s)]
*  Well, that's a fair question. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=659.6s)]
*  They'll never answer it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=661.62s)]
*  They'll just make you be quiet. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=662.98s)]
*  Their first move always is censorship [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=664.48s)]
*  and their second move inevitably is punishment. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=666.72s)]
*  We learned that again last night [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=669.12s)]
*  when we were suspended from Twitter. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=670.64s)]
*  Quote, we have determined that this account [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=672.32s)]
*  violated the Twitter rules, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=674.16s)]
*  specifically for violating our rules against hateful conduct, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  Twitter wrote to us. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=678.72s)]
*  The only way out of Twitter jail was to delete our tweet, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=679.8000000000001s)]
*  to pretend we never said it, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=683.0s)]
*  to cleanse America's conscience [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=685.08s)]
*  by just whiting out the past. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=688.0s)]
*  What was our crime, by the way? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=690.7s)]
*  Well, we dared to highlight two accounts [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  that Twitter has banned from Charlie Kirk and the Babylon Bee. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=694.04s)]
*  There was nothing hateful about either one. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=697.36s)]
*  We'd say look them up, but you can't, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=699.92s)]
*  because they're gone now. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  But both merely noted that biological sex is fixed at birth. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=702.28s)]
*  This has been universally acknowledged [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=706.4399999999999s)]
*  by hope it was homo sapiens for at least 300,000 years. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=707.8199999999999s)]
*  So it was a factual statement. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  But on Twitter, as in our public life, truth is no defense. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=713.76s)]
*  Twitter is now run by a man called Parag Agarwal, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=718.12s)]
*  who has said plainly he does not believe in free speech. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=721.1600000000001s)]
*  Agarwal came to this country as an adult [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=724.12s)]
*  to get a degree from Stanford. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=725.84s)]
*  Now Agarwal controls the single most important forum [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=727.44s)]
*  for America's political conversation. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=730.76s)]
*  That is a big and important job. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=733.22s)]
*  It's not just a public company, it's much more than that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=735.24s)]
*  It's a kind of public trust [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=736.98s)]
*  that allows this democracy to function. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=738.34s)]
*  So you would think you'd want a guy like that [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=740.2800000000001s)]
*  in a position like that to have some respect [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=742.26s)]
*  for his adopted country's core institutions [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=745.0s)]
*  beginning with and primarily the First Amendment. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=747.48s)]
*  But Agarwal has no respect for a First Amendment [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=750.84s)]
*  or a constitution. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=752.68s)]
*  He explained that openly in a 2020 speech. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=753.56s)]
*  Watch. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=756.56s)]
*  Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=757.56s)]
*  but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=761.76s)]
*  And our moves are reflective of things [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=764.68s)]
*  that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=768.16s)]
*  The kinds of things that we do to work about this [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=771.2s)]
*  is to focus less on thinking about free speech, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=775.0s)]
*  but thinking about how the times have changed. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=779.24s)]
*  One of the changes today that we see is [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=781.9s)]
*  speech is easy on the internet. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=784.84s)]
*  Most people can speak. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=786.62s)]
*  Where our role is particularly emphasized [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=788.24s)]
*  is who can be heard. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=790.96s)]
*  Oh, so the new standard isn't your right as a citizen [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=794.64s)]
*  to say what you believe is true. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=798.28s)]
*  The new standard is achieving something called [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=800.78s)]
*  healthy public conversation. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=803.28s)]
*  By the way, this is not one man's opinion. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=804.76s)]
*  You grew up in a country where people were free to say [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  what they wanted. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=808.62s)]
*  But now that political speech, in fact, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=809.74s)]
*  all speech is disseminated to other citizens [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=811.54s)]
*  via social media, this is the guy who actually controls [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=813.78s)]
*  what you're allowed to think. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=817.8s)]
*  So what is healthy public conversation? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=819.7s)]
*  What does that mean exactly? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=821.5s)]
*  We're interested. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=823.18s)]
*  So we texted Parag Agarwal very first thing this morning, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=824.0s)]
*  and then we emailed his office, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=826.5s)]
*  and then him personally, all to find out. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=827.58s)]
*  Agarwal was too cowardly to respond to us. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=830.0600000000001s)]
*  So we're gonna have to assume that a healthy [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=832.74s)]
*  public conversation is whatever Parag Agarwal [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=834.6s)]
*  wants it to be. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=837.78s)]
*  He decides the meaning. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=839.74s)]
*  In other words, a single man who has total [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=841.24s)]
*  and undisguised contempt for America's most basic values [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=844.28s)]
*  gets to decide what Americans are allowed to talk about. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  Parag Agarwal doesn't think you should know [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=852.26s)]
*  about Hunter Biden's laptop, that's unhealthy. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=853.92s)]
*  So he censors the story, you don't get to see it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=856.3s)]
*  He doesn't think you should be allowed to discuss [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=858.42s)]
*  basic biology in public. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=860.02s)]
*  We're erasing all science, because it's unhealthy. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=861.74s)]
*  So now you're not allowed to talk about it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=864.9s)]
*  In fact, you're banned, silence, censored. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=866.3s)]
*  We can't control Parag Agarwal, but we can ask, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  how do you feel about this new standard? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=872.4799999999999s)]
*  Not so long ago, this was a free country. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=874.42s)]
*  Now Parag Agarwal and nine other billionaires [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=876.4599999999999s)]
*  whose names you might not even know, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=878.3599999999999s)]
*  who certainly were not elected to anything, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=879.5999999999999s)]
*  get to determine the limits of your conversations. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  Are we okay with this? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=882.9799999999999s)]
*  What happened to all the liberals [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=884.6999999999999s)]
*  and the self-described civil libertarians [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=886.06s)]
*  we used to have in America? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=887.5799999999999s)]
*  They don't seem to be fighting the power anymore. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=889.38s)]
*  They seem to have joined it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=891.8199999999999s)]
*  How about Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Jmv0vZvJ4&t=893.4399999999999s)]
