# Tucker Carlson: Huh? #shorts
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI)
*  Mitt Romney voted against the nomination of Kintanji Brown Jackson to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, he thought she wasn't qualified. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=5.44s)]
*  Now this week, Mitt Romney announced that he is supporting the same person's confirmation to the Supreme Court. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Huh? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=14.56s)]
*  So here's what it took for Mitt Romney to finally support Kintanji Brown Jackson. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=15.68s)]
*  He learned in the course of Supreme Court confirmation hearings that she gave lenient sentences to child pornographers. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=20.48s)]
*  Mitt Romney apparently didn't know that last year, hence the vote against her. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=26.8s)]
*  Now that he knows that Kintanji Brown Jackson has disregarded sentencing guidelines to benefit kiddie pornographers, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  it's a yes from Mitt Romney. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=38.24s)]
*  That's the junior senator from the state of Utah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh5QbW_9eI&t=40.52s)]
