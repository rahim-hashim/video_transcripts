# Tucker: Violence is already beginning
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=0.0s)]
*  So you can question whether Joe Biden actually got [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=3.84s)]
*  what's the number 81 million votes [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=6.12s)]
*  in the last presidential election [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=8.3s)]
*  and actually later in the show we will. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=9.68s)]
*  But even if you accept that there actually were people [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=11.88s)]
*  who voted for Joe Biden voluntarily, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  it's hard to believe that many of them got anything like [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=17.32s)]
*  what they expected in return for their votes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=20.32s)]
*  Joe Biden, not to be dark about it, just to be honest, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=23.12s)]
*  Joe Biden has turned out to be an unparalleled disaster. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=24.96s)]
*  It's not an overstatement. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  In fact, it's a generous assessment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=28.56s)]
*  Our country has never seen anything like [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  what Joe Biden has done. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=32.92s)]
*  Barely 15 months into his first term as president, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=34.76s)]
*  Joe Biden has crashed the stock market, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=37.36s)]
*  provoked a food shortage, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=39.4s)]
*  opened our borders to millions of illegal aliens, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=40.96s)]
*  presided over historic rises in murder, inflation, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=43.4s)]
*  and drug ODs, as well as a corresponding plunge [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=46.68s)]
*  in overall life expectancy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  And then because all of that wasn't punitive enough [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=51.2s)]
*  for a country as racist as ours, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=53.8s)]
*  he dragged the United States [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=56.0s)]
*  into an entirely pointless war with a nuclear armed power [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=57.28s)]
*  on behalf of a corrupt foreign government [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=60.4s)]
*  that once bribed his drug addicted son. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=62.2s)]
*  That's all real. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=64.4s)]
*  Joe Biden did all of that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=65.24s)]
*  And those are just the big, easy to measure crimes [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=67.16s)]
*  he has committed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=69.84s)]
*  He spent virtually every night cataloging some of the rest. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=71.12s)]
*  Shuttered schools, permanent looting, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=74.0s)]
*  Latin American levels of wealth inequality, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=76.48s)]
*  tampons in the boys' bathroom, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=79.12s)]
*  $7 a gallon gasoline, unprecedented race hatred, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=81.04s)]
*  homelessness, mental illness, suicide, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=84.52s)]
*  and above it all, across the Pacific Ocean, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=87.44s)]
*  a Chinese government that's laughing out loud [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  as we destroy ourselves for no reason. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=91.56s)]
*  That's some of what Joe Biden has done so far. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=93.88s)]
*  He promised a return to normal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=96.8s)]
*  He's delivered war and economic collapse. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden is old enough, unfortunately, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  that he almost never, certainly, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  be held accountable for any of what he's done. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  But his party should be. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=108.16s)]
*  How will any Democrat outside West Hollywood [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=109.8s)]
*  ever get elected in this country again? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=112.48s)]
*  In a fully functioning democracy, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  that would be an honest question. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=116.56s)]
*  But Biden has a plan. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=118.72s)]
*  Tork up the fear, ban complaining, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=120.28s)]
*  criminalize the opposition. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=123.0s)]
*  Just 24 hours ago, Joe Biden, the President of the United States, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=125.0s)]
*  told us that people who don't support him [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=128.12s)]
*  are the single biggest security threat [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=130.28s)]
*  that faces this country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=132.2s)]
*  Not Al-Qaeda, not the Chinese military, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=133.36s)]
*  not the Mexican drug cartels, not even Russia, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  which we are told daily is the wellspring of all evil. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=138.68s)]
*  No, you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=141.44s)]
*  You're the biggest threat because you don't vote Democrat. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=143.64s)]
*  As Joe Biden put it, quote, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=147.76s)]
*  political organization that's existed in American history. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=150.24s)]
*  The most extreme, the worst. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=153.68s)]
*  Worse than the Klan, worse than the Nazis, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=155.16s)]
*  worse than the anarchists who murdered an American president, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=157.2s)]
*  worse than anyone ever. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=160.32s)]
*  That's you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=161.68s)]
*  You're an existential threat to the country you were born in. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=162.84s)]
*  It's hard to believe Joe Biden said that, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=167.12s)]
*  but he did say it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=168.8s)]
*  And of course, some people believed him. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=170.4s)]
*  Here's what the Supreme Court looks like tonight. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=172.56s)]
*  You'll notice the riot-grade security fencing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=174.84s)]
*  around the building. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Why is it there? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's there to protect the justices inside [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=178.88s)]
*  from the mobs that Joe Biden has incited [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  with the demagoguery you just heard. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  Samuel Leto is a 72-year-old legal scholar [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=186.44s)]
*  whose views would have been considered ordinary, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=189.08s)]
*  mainstream, maybe five years ago. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, according to Joe Biden, he is a dangerous extremist. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=193.96s)]
*  He's a member of a movement more threatening [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=197.72s)]
*  than any political movement in American history. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=199.8s)]
*  What's the result? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, today, Leto had to cancel a public appearance [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=203.72s)]
*  because there were too many threats on his life. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=206.36s)]
*  Each one of those threats is, in fact, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=209.08s)]
*  a threat to us and our country. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=211.24s)]
*  You don't want to live in a country [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=213.44s)]
*  where Supreme Court justices cower in fear for their lives [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=215.12s)]
*  if they reach the wrong conclusions. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  That's the definition of a failed state. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  Turns out we have a justice department that exists [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  to prevent things like this from happening. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=225.24s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  But under Joe Biden, the DOJ is too beholden to the mob [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=228.64s)]
*  to say a word about it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=232.0s)]
*  You can't offend Antifa. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=233.27999999999997s)]
*  They're a vital constituency. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  Here's the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  appearing today to tell us what he's worried about most. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=239.64s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=242.44s)]
*  Consistent with the president's executive order [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  on tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=246.0s)]
*  we are issuing a comprehensive [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=249.27999999999997s)]
*  environmental justice enforcement strategy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=251.04s)]
*  Communities of color, indigenous communities, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  and low-income communities often bear the brunt [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=257.2s)]
*  of the harm caused by environmental crime, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=260.56s)]
*  pollution, and climate change. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=263.92s)]
*  Well, of course, the greatest threat is global warming, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  which, by the way, is racist, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=269.68s)]
*  like so many other weather patterns. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  That's what Merrick Garland is most afraid of tonight. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=273.4s)]
*  And of course, in order to fix global warming, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=276.4s)]
*  which is existential, whatever that means, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=278.12s)]
*  you're gonna have to hand Merrick Garland and Joe Biden [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=281.08s)]
*  a lot more power over your life. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=284.24s)]
*  Sorry, that's the only solution. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=285.92s)]
*  Much more on that to come. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=287.76s)]
*  But for now, here's what you should know. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=289.56s)]
*  Merrick Garland didn't even mention the threats, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=291.0s)]
*  the physical threats to this country's highest court, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=294.04s)]

*  who wants a real war with nuclear armed Russia? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=589.1800000000001s)]
*  Who exactly is Seth Moulton talking about when he says we? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=593.3000000000001s)]
*  We were wondering that we watched Biden. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=597.46s)]
*  Yesterday he traveled to Alabama [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=598.9000000000001s)]
*  and he visited the only constituency in America [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=600.5400000000001s)]
*  that longs for war with nuclear armed Russia [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=603.14s)]
*  and that would be his donors. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=605.34s)]
*  He toured a Lockheed Martin plant [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  and as he did, Biden boasted [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=608.62s)]
*  that we're sending so many weapons to Ukraine [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=610.02s)]
*  that mothers in the United States [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=613.06s)]
*  are naming their children [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=614.5s)]
*  after Lockheed Martin's missile systems. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=615.9s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=617.74s)]
*  Well, we built the weapons and equipment [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=619.46s)]
*  to help defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=621.22s)]
*  years ago. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=623.78s)]
*  That's true again today. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=625.38s)]
*  Those jamming missiles like the ones manufactured [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  right here in Pike County, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=629.22s)]
*  are highly portable, are extremely effective [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=631.54s)]
*  against a wide range of armored targets. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=634.9s)]
*  They can hit targets up to 400 meters away. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=637.66s)]
*  In fact, they've been so important, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=640.7s)]
*  there's even a story about Ukrainian parents [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=642.9s)]
*  naming their children, not a joke. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=644.94s)]
*  A newborn child, a Javan or a Jemalini. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=647.78s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=651.94s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=655.74s)]
*  Just a little joke about weapons systems. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=656.58s)]
*  You know, it used to be when American presidents [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=658.26s)]
*  talked about killing people, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=660.14s)]
*  the first thing they did was make certain [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=661.38s)]
*  it was absolutely justified. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=662.86s)]
*  We've been invaded, Pearl Harbor, 9-11. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=663.94s)]
*  This is an entirely voluntary exercise. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=666.62s)]
*  And the second thing they did [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=669.58s)]
*  was attach some gravity to the idea of people dying [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  because when people die, it's sad. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=673.82s)]
*  They leave behind spouses and parents [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=675.0600000000001s)]
*  and siblings and children. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=677.66s)]
*  Death is sad. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=678.86s)]
*  Acknowledge that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=679.7s)]
*  They don't joke about it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=681.58s)]
*  Joe Biden considers that an uplifting story. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=682.98s)]
*  Joe Biden is demented and he's dangerous [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=685.78s)]
*  and so are the people who work for him. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=688.02s)]
*  That's true. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=689.1800000000001s)]
*  Sorry to say it out loud, but it's real. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=690.9399999999999s)]
*  This country needs sane leadership [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=691.78s)]
*  and it needs it immediately. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=693.34s)]
*  It cannot come too soon. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=694.3s)]
*  Pray the midterms are fair. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNjRi5AJ53s&t=695.8199999999999s)]
