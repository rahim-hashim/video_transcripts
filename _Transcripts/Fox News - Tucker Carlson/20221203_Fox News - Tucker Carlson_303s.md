# Miranda Devine: Elon Musk's Twitter files likely 'tailored, redacted' version
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg)
*  But we wanted to speak first to Miranda Divine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=0.0s)]
*  She is, of course, a New York Post columnist. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=3.48s)]
*  We spoke to her at the time, more than two years ago, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=5.32s)]
*  about the censorship of this story. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=7.32s)]
*  She's since written a book about it called Laptop from Hell, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=8.68s)]
*  which is excellent. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=11.16s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=11.72s)]
*  Miranda Divine, you are at the very center of this story. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=12.76s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=14.72s)]
*  Look, I think we've seen quite a bit that's useful. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=17.8s)]
*  It's not really the smoking gun we'd hoped for. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=21.36s)]
*  I feel that Elon Musk has held back some material. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=23.52s)]
*  In particular, there's a tweet in which Matt Taibbi says, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=26.4s)]
*  well, he hasn't seen any evidence that law enforcement [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=30.52s)]
*  specifically warned off Twitter from our story. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=33.68s)]
*  But that's just not correct. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=37.04s)]
*  I've seen a sworn affidavit from Joel Roth, the former head [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  of Twitter's Trust and Safety. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=42.68s)]
*  He was meeting every week before the election with FBI [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  and other intelligence officials. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=48.72s)]
*  They warned specifically of what they called [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=50.64s)]
*  a hack and leak operation, a dump of Russian disinformation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=53.0s)]
*  And Joel Roth says that in those meetings, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=57.88s)]
*  he was told there was a quote, rumor [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  that it was about Hunter Biden. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=63.0s)]
*  So they seeded that information with the social media giants, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  the FBI did. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=69.12s)]
*  And that ensured that within hours of our story going live [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=70.44s)]
*  on October 14, 2020, three weeks before the election, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=74.28s)]
*  it was censored. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=78.32s)]
*  Now we're finding out a little bit more [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  that there was discussion behind the scenes at Twitter, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=81.2s)]
*  quite an active argument about whether this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=84.08s)]
*  was a First Amendment problem. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=87.56s)]
*  But the other interesting thing is how little Jack Dorsey [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  was involved. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=94.2s)]
*  He was obviously just blindsided, it seems, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=95.76s)]
*  by the people under him who were intent on censoring this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=99.36s)]
*  And I think we have to point the figure. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=103.84s)]
*  You mentioned him already. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Jim Baker, Twitter's number one lawyer, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=106.68s)]
*  who says their caution is warranted. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  Now that's coming from your top lawyer. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  You're going to pay attention to it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  He, of course, is former FBI general counsel, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=117.56s)]
*  very much involved in the Russia collusion hoax. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=120.68s)]
*  What's interesting is, for the purposes of today's story, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=126.0s)]
*  which as I've said five times, is still unfolding, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=128.96s)]
*  but Elon Musk announced earlier that this release of documents [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=131.84s)]
*  was going to begin at 5 PM Eastern. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  We're now more than three hours past that, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  and we still haven't seen everything [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=141.8s)]
*  that they're going to release. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  He said, well, actually, at the last minute, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  we're getting some facts straight. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  How likely is it, do you believe, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  of course it's certain, that he was leaned on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=149.68s)]
*  by government agencies? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  Just like everyone who tries to release all the information [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  is leaned on by government agencies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  And the pressure has to have been immense. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=160.28s)]
*  I remember just yesterday, Wednesday, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  he met with Tim Cook from Apple, who had been threatening, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=165.44s)]
*  even though Elon Musk now says he wasn't threatening, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=169.44s)]
*  but he was threatening, as was the White House, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  that Twitter would basically be wiped out [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  by being removed from the Google and Apple app stores. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=176.96s)]
*  And so Elon Musk met in person with Tim Cook, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=181.0s)]
*  they had a stroll around the pond of Apple headquarters, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  and came out of that saying, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=187.56s)]
*  well, Apple is not going to do that, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=189.56s)]
*  never was going to do that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, obviously, some sort of accommodation, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=193.0s)]
*  you would think, was made between the two of them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=195.56s)]
*  And perhaps Elon Musk has given us a sort of a tailored [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=198.12s)]
*  or redacted version of all the material behind the scenes, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=202.44s)]
*  because I know from the lawyers who were involved [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=206.44s)]
*  in the deposition last week of FBI agent Elvis Chan, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=210.44s)]
*  that there's much more to the story [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=215.8s)]
*  with the social media companies and that top Twitter people [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=217.52s)]
*  like Joel Roth, the former head of trust and safety, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=222.28s)]
*  basically the top censor, the top moderation guy, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=225.56s)]
*  he admitted that in one of those meetings [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=229.64s)]
*  that Hunter Biden's name was brought up. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=233.2s)]
*  So while Mark Zuckerberg's being quiet about that, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=235.84s)]
*  and while in this particular dump of information [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=238.76s)]
*  from Twitter so far, 38 or something tweets so far, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=242.0s)]
*  there's been no mention of Hunter Biden being mentioned, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=247.24s)]
*  but we know he was mentioned by the FBI [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=251.28s)]
*  to the social media giants. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=254.16s)]
*  So will that come out in this feed from Elon Musk? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=256.0s)]
*  Is he holding something back? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=260.6s)]
*  Or is it just that Facebook really was first out of the blocks [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=262.36s)]
*  to censor the New York Post and Twitter followed suit? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=266.08s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=270.36s)]
*  I suspect that Elon Musk has been leaned on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=272.68s)]
*  and he's kept a little bit of information in reserve. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=277.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, there are still thousands of pages [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=281.24s)]
*  of Warren Commission documents under seal. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  So that would be consistent [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=285.72s)]
*  with the way things work in this country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  Reina Devine, thank you so much. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=288.88s)]
*  Great to see you tonight. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=290.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=291.72s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQK_CcmxKGg&t=292.56s)]
