# Biden was the 'special needs candidate': Miranda Devine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY)
*  Randa Devine is a columnist with the New York Post. She's watched all this from the very beginning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=0.0s)]
*  She's got a PhD in the media business, having spent her life in it, and we're happy to have [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=3.68s)]
*  her join us now. Randa, thanks so much for coming on. So it does seem to me like the media, once [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  again reporting a story three years late, is trying to get away from their responsibility for this disaster. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=11.44s)]
*  You're so right. It was crystal clear to everybody back in early 2020 in Iowa and New Hampshire where [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=18.96s)]
*  Joe Biden was just woeful. He needed to cart around a teleprompter to the smallest town halls [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=26.32s)]
*  with the most obvious stump speech that every other candidate could recite in their sleep. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=34.24s)]
*  I watched as the sort of you look around the audience and it just twigged to people that this [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=41.04s)]
*  guy was not all there, that there was a screw loose. He was really the special needs candidate. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  He was ignored. No one showed up to any of his events. It was an open secret in the media. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=52.56s)]
*  He bottomed out in Iowa number four, number five in New Hampshire. And one of the main culprits [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=59.2s)]
*  that you left out of your very good list of culprits is James Clyburn, who used his authority [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  in South Carolina among black voters to swing the vote behind Joe Biden and give him the momentum [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=72.56s)]
*  because the Democratic Party had just decided, and Barack Obama as well, that Joe Biden had to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=79.44s)]
*  be installed to beat Donald Trump because he was the only one who had a sort of a moderate image [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  and he had a very carefully cultivated image that was a myth, that he was this unifying force, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  that he was an old Washington professional, a great foreign affairs expert, and a kind man, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=99.44s)]
*  a family man, a decent man, a working class Joe, and full of empathy which the country needed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=106.4s)]
*  after COVID. None of that was true. And the problem for the Democratic Party was that as soon as [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=113.36s)]
*  voters, pretty much after Afghanistan, when Joe Biden was so callous, so dishonest, and so [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=120.72s)]
*  incompetent, the American people saw, including Biden voters, saw who he really was. And I think [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=127.12s)]
*  once somebody that you have admired and respected, looked up to, trusted, once you realize [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  that they're none of those things, that they're a liar, that they're possibly corrupt, that they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  lack empathy, then you can never go back. You recoil. And we're seeing that in polls, which [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  are just woeful. I mean, just 29%, I think, of Democrat voters want Joe Biden to run again [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=155.44s)]
*  in 29. And of course, the media now sees that. They don't want to be on the losing side. And [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=162.32s)]
*  Joe Biden is surplus to requirements now. They don't need him. They can discard him, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=168.64s)]
*  and they'll be brutal. This is the CNN presidency, and they should forever live with that stain, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=173.44s)]
*  I think. Miranda Devine, I appreciate your summation of that very much. Thanks. Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=180.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HikiZCJzqYY&t=192.32s)]
