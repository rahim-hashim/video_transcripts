# This is the 3rd failed impeachment trial of Trump: Hurt
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4)
*  We should tell you, and as we said at the top, this is the only hour on American television that is not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=0.0s)]
*  broadcasting unfiltered propaganda into the homes of unsuspecting viewers. On the screen you see [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=6.8s)]
*  eight boxes, those are eight different TV channels, taking the Nancy Pelosi feed unfiltered. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=13.92s)]
*  Now if at any time in your life you've ever made fun of totalitarian regimes that, you know, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=21.28s)]
*  broadcast lies into the homes of the population that they can't turn off, take a look at that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=26.32s)]
*  That's happening right now. Meanwhile, gas is over five bucks. Inflation is higher than it's been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=34.08s)]
*  in the lifetime of most Americans. Violent crime is making cities impossible to live in, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=42.0s)]
*  and more than a hundred thousand Americans OD'd on drugs last year. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=47.36s)]
*  Why isn't there a primetime hearing about any of that? Charlie Heard is the opinion editor of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=51.68s)]
*  the Washington Times. He joins us tonight. Charlie, great to see you. I mean, if you take three steps [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=57.44s)]
*  back, what we're really watching is members of Congress talking about themselves again. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=62.64s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, because the alternative is for them to have to talk about policies, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=70.0s)]
*  and if they talk about policies, they have to talk about their, and it's not just their failures, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=76.16s)]
*  you know, all the failures we see right in front of us, you know, gas prices, crime, an open border, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=80.8s)]
*  fentanyl deaths, you can go through, the list is endless, and if anybody got out of Washington, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  any of these people got out of Washington and talked to normal people, they would realize that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=91.44s)]
*  American people are very, very concerned about a lot of things. This is not one of them, but then [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=95.12s)]
*  you step back even farther and you look at the, just the cavalcade of lies that Democrat politicians [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=100.48s)]
*  have made in their promises to get elected over, ever since, even before Joe Biden became, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=107.44s)]
*  came to Washington, whether it's solving health care problems for poor people, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  ending poverty, or providing public education to people, they failed on all of these fronts. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=118.72s)]
*  And the reason they, and I call this the third failed impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=125.52s)]
*  the reason they have to talk about this stuff is because they can't talk about those other issues, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=130.72s)]
*  they have to distract everybody from, but then it's even crazier than that, because when you [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=134.4s)]
*  get to the issue of security and you start thinking about what people, you know, whose [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=138.8s)]
*  businesses were destroyed in these riots that Democrats supported in the year running up to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=143.2s)]
*  the election, and you think about the security, think about the parents whose children, they fear [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=148.88s)]
*  for their children going into an elementary school today, and Democrats control both chambers [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=154.72s)]
*  of Congress and the White House. They have not done a damn thing to protect children in schools. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=160.48s)]
*  Beyond that, the third branch of government, the judiciary, we have Supreme Court justices living [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=167.28s)]
*  under the threat of their family being assassinated, and Nancy Pelosi will do nothing about it. All she [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=173.28s)]
*  can talk about is this day a year and a half ago when she was afraid or they were afraid of some [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=181.28s)]
*  goofball, trespassing, nutty rioters coming through the Capitol. I think that what we're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  seeing, and I think all this is going to backfire, and I think what we're seeing right here, and I [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=195.68s)]
*  think it's great. I mean, that image you just showed of all the networks of obedient people, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=199.84s)]
*  obedient networks showing this thing on command, I think what we're seeing is the final swirling [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  of credibility for the media and Democrats going down the drain. I think they're going to pay a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  price, and I think this spectacle right here is going to make it even worse for them because [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  the difference between their concern here and the concern about anybody else, including [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=226.56s)]
*  schoolchildren in elementary schools, it's breathtaking. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  You and I entered journalism about the same time over 30 years ago. It seemed honorable then. It [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=235.52s)]
*  seems completely shameful now. It really does. Shameful. Charlie Hurd, I appreciate you coming [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OxxrECoX4&t=239.76000000000002s)]
