# 2 inmates at women-only NJ prison became pregnant from transgender convict
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8)
*  So in modern America, if you point out that biological sex is a physical reality, you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=0.0s)]
*  can be fired from your job. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  The Washington Post will send a reporter to your house to intimidate you, but it doesn't [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  change anything. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=9.72s)]
*  Denying reality doesn't change reality. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=10.92s)]
*  You can say gravity isn't real, but if you jump off the roof of your garage, you're still [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=12.9s)]
*  going to get hurt. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=15.48s)]
*  And that's true for biological sex. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=16.98s)]
*  It is in fact real, whether the authorities admit it or not. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=18.2s)]
*  Officials in New Jersey are learning that lesson this week. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=20.96s)]
*  Two female inmates at a supposedly all-women's prison in New Jersey have just become pregnant. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=23.48s)]
*  You wonder how that happened. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=28.8s)]
*  Well turns out those women had sexual encounters with another inmate who was a biological man [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=30.6s)]
*  passing as a woman. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=34.02s)]
*  Now some people predicted that this would happen, and they were laughed at, mocked, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=35.88s)]
*  and attacked as bigots. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=40.68s)]
*  Kara Dansky is at the very top of that list. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  She said this years ago on our show. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=43.96s)]
*  She's the president of the U.S. chapter of the Women's Declaration International, author [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=45.92s)]
*  of the book The Abolition of Sex, How the Transgender Agenda Harms Women and Girls, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  and we are happy to have Kara Dansky back. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=55.32s)]
*  Kara, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=57.24s)]
*  I'll never forget the first time, and it had to have been at least four years ago, when [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=58.24s)]
*  you said if we keep going down this path, we're going to have biological men in women's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=62.44s)]
*  prisons. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=66.6s)]
*  And you were right. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=67.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=68.6s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=69.6s)]
*  You know, though the story that's happening in New Jersey is obviously horrible for so [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=71.24s)]
*  many reasons. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=76.16s)]
*  We need to not have men being housed in women's prisons. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=77.16s)]
*  But a couple takeaways from this that I just want to point out are first of all, the state [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=80.88s)]
*  is not getting away with this by telling its residents that they are housing men in women's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=85.36s)]
*  prisons. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=91.08s)]
*  What they are doing, of course, is telling the residents that they are housing so-called [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=92.08s)]
*  transgender women or trans women in women's prisons, suggesting that there is some sort [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=96.64s)]
*  of subcategory of women that is called transgender women or trans women. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=103.24s)]
*  And it's not true. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=108.66s)]
*  The fact of this story shoots the shoots a hole right through the trope that trans women [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=109.8s)]
*  are women. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=116.16s)]
*  Our society has been taught that we are supposed to say and think that trans women are women. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=117.16s)]
*  But obviously, that is not true, because the individuals that are the focus of the story, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  impregnated women, and every thinking adult, no matter what the president of the United [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=128.72s)]
*  States has to say on the matter, knows that there is no category of women who can impregnate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=133.6s)]
*  women. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  So I really want to thank you for highlighting this story. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  And I also just want to point out that this is not just a problem in New Jersey. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=143.88s)]
*  This is a problem across the country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=148.72s)]
*  I know that we have talked previously about how the state of California recently enacted [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  a law at the end of 2020, which went into effect in 2021, which mandates that men be [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=155.66s)]
*  housed in women's prisons on the basis of their so-called gender identity if they say [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  that they are women. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=167.0s)]
*  The Washington state has a similar policy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  However, this is not just happening in blue states. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=170.84s)]
*  This is happening across the country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=174.2s)]
*  As far as I know, 49 states plus the District of Columbia have some form of law or policy [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=176.04s)]
*  in place that mandates the housing of men in women's prisons. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=182.48s)]
*  Why is it left to you and J.K. Rowling and a couple of others to point this out? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=187.62s)]
*  Where the physicians who know perfectly well that what you're saying is true, the biologists [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  who know it every bit as well. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=195.33999999999997s)]
*  Why are they going along with this when they know it's a lie? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=196.56s)]
*  So the entire medical establishment in the United States has been captured by so-called [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=200.4s)]
*  trans ideology. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=205.68s)]
*  And what I really want all Americans across the political spectrum to understand is that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  trans is not a civil rights movement to protect a marginalized community of people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=212.88s)]
*  It is a multi-trillion dollar industry that is pushing this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=218.36s)]
*  It is paying the medical establishment. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  It is paying most media outlets. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=224.38s)]
*  It is paying our government. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=226.5s)]
*  It is paying our schools at all levels, elementary schools through college, to push the idea [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=228.1s)]
*  that material, the material reality of sex does not exist and that what is more important [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=234.54s)]
*  than the material reality of sex is so-called gender identity. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=240.46s)]
*  This is all being pushed by a multi-trillion dollar industry in the guise of a civil rights [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=244.88s)]
*  movement. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=250.5s)]
*  It's all a lie. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=251.5s)]
*  And these are the people providing our medical care. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  That's really scary when you put it that way. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=255.5s)]
*  They are. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=256.78s)]
*  I know someone who is a medical student right now and she is horrified about what's being [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=257.78s)]
*  taught. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=261.74s)]
*  I do just want to say really quickly, there's something that has been announced in the past [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=262.74s)]
*  couple of weeks called the Women's Bill of Rights. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=266.02s)]
*  This was drafted by members of the Women's Liberation Front and by members of Independent [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=268.38s)]
*  Women's Voices, supported by my organization, Women's Declaration International, as well [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=273.02s)]
*  as Concerned Women for America. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=277.88s)]
*  And I really hope that one of the members of Congress introduces it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=280.02s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=283.22s)]
*  I hope so too. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=284.22s)]
*  We'll see you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=285.22s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S6uutxdKX8&t=286.22s)]
