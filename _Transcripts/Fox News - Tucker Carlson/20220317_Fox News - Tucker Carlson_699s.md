# Tucker: This is a highly dangerous situation
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, Houston, Texas is one of the rare, nice, big cities left in this country. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=3.36s)]
*  A little hot in the summer, but great people, very pretty neighborhoods and a lot going [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=8.6s)]
*  on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=12.88s)]
*  Thanks to the energy sector, biotech and aerospace, Houston has an enormous and still robust economy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=13.88s)]
*  It is hardly some dying mill town in the Northeast or the upper Midwest. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=20.32s)]
*  Your kids might want to move to Houston someday, maybe after college. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=24.2s)]
*  It's not Baltimore. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  But all of a sudden, Houston, Texas is starting to look a little bit more like Baltimore. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=29.3s)]
*  Crime in Houston has gotten scary. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=33.86s)]
*  The murder rate there has risen by more than 50 percent in just the last year. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=36.26s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=41.1s)]
*  Here's a local news report. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=42.1s)]
*  A deadly start to the year across Houston. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=44.3s)]
*  Police investigating at least 41 homicides through 24 days. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  So far this year, Houston has more murders than New York City, Los Angeles, even Chicago. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  It's one of those things where I'm fearful for my family just to go out of the house. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=57.54s)]
*  The president of the Houston Police Officers Union frustrated. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=60.5s)]
*  If it keeps up this pace, we're going to be well over 500 murders this year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=64.02s)]
*  I'm fearful just for my family to go outside of the house. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=68.46s)]
*  As you heard, that was the president of the police union in Houston, so he would know. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=71.14s)]
*  It's amazing this is happening in all places in Houston, and what's so telling about this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=77.3s)]
*  crime wave is how recently it began. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=81.22s)]
*  Murders in Houston started to spike in a big way after Joe Biden became president. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=84.86s)]
*  Why is that exactly? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=89.36s)]
*  Very simple answer. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=91.14s)]
*  Joe Biden opened the southern border. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=92.14s)]
*  Texas shares more than 1,200 miles of border with Mexico. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=94.86s)]
*  There is a brutal cartel war underway in Mexico right now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=98.1s)]
*  It's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=101.9s)]
*  Many of the combatants in that war have now moved north into Texas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=103.74s)]
*  They brought drugs with them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=107.84s)]
*  They've also brought machine guns. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=108.84s)]
*  This fall, a felon opened fire on Houston police officers with a fully automatic rifle. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=110.78s)]
*  Now, you hear a lot about assault weapons, but the truth is, authorities don't see fully [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  automatic weapons very often. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=120.02s)]
*  They are heavily regulated and typically they're owned by collectors. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=122.62s)]
*  But automatic weapons are very common in war zones, and there is a war in Mexico. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=126.04s)]
*  So with no border in place, the cartels are bringing their armaments here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=131.14s)]
*  Watch this firefight in Houston. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=135.06s)]
*  Deon, it's Houston police. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=137.22s)]
*  Let's do this thing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=139.74s)]
*  Let's do this thing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=140.74s)]
*  Let's do this thing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=141.74s)]
*  Let's do this thing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=142.74s)]
*  That's automatic weapons fire. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=143.74s)]
*  It sounds like Syria or Mexico, but it's an apartment complex in Houston, Texas. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  We could go on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=160.9s)]
*  If you know anybody who lives in Houston, call and ask, how's your city changed recently? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=161.9s)]
*  And they'll tell you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  Open borders did this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=168.94s)]
*  Houston didn't do it to itself. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=169.94s)]
*  This was done to Houston and not just to Houston, to so many places across this country where [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=171.28s)]
*  millions of illegal aliens have flooded in during Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=176.66s)]
*  On Monday, for example, more than 100 illegal Haitian migrants landed in the Florida Keys [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=180.94s)]
*  in a single boat. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=186.16s)]
*  You're watching aerial footage from Summerlin Key, Florida. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=188.06s)]
*  Pictures like this are no longer uncommon in the state of Florida. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=191.5s)]
*  The world is coming to America's shores. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=194.58s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  Because they're fully aware that the Biden administration is rewarding foreign nationals [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  for violating our federal immigration law. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=201.58s)]
*  It is an invasion. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=204.34s)]
*  Huge numbers of Americans are dying as a result of that invasion. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  A hundred thousand dead last year of drug odies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=209.9s)]
*  Most were killed by fentanyl that is trucked in from Mexico across open borders. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=212.9s)]
*  Long term, there are massive labor market disruptions. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=218.06s)]
*  There is evaporating social cohesion and so on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  The costs of this have been beyond calculating. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=223.72s)]
*  And this is exactly why no sane country opens its borders ever, ever, anywhere. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=227.16s)]
*  What Joe Biden is doing right now has never been done. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=234.52s)]
*  And it's about to get much worse. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=236.84s)]
*  We're not guessing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=238.68s)]
*  Currently, a Trump-era regulation called Title 42 allows the Border Patrol to turn illegal [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=239.68s)]
*  migrants back to Mexico on the grounds that there's a pandemic in progress, so we probably [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=244.46s)]
*  shouldn't let millions of people infected with COVID move here without permission. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=249.72s)]
*  This seems sensible. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=253.52s)]
*  But according to Democrats, this rule is racist because it might slow the human wave of migration. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=254.96s)]
*  So for months, they've been demanding that the Biden administration suspend this rule. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=261.04s)]
*  Watch them whine. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=266.08s)]
*  I urge President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas to immediately put a stop to these expulsions [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=267.08s)]
*  and to end this Title 42 policy at our southern border. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=273.68s)]
*  We cannot continue these hateful and xenophobic Trump policies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=279.16s)]
*  In addition, a relic, Title 42, exists. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  It is a relic of the Trump administration. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  It was created to be mean-spirited. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  Title 43, I ask for a suspension of it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  I urge the Biden administration and my colleagues to remember the refugees who are waiting at [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=296.44000000000005s)]
*  our border, kept out by the cruel and unnecessary Title 42 policy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=302.26000000000005s)]
*  Look, Title 42 is being used in a way that I think is indiscriminate and that violates [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  the basic essence of our law. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=315.52s)]
*  But this process that the Biden administration has continued from the Trump administration, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=317.64s)]
*  in my mind, is inexcusable. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=323.64s)]
*  So your kid has to wear a mask in school, but illegal aliens get to come here with no [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=326.35999999999996s)]
*  restrictions at all, despite the fact they may be infected with COVID, because otherwise [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=330.4s)]
*  you're a racist. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=334.2s)]
*  That's the case they were making. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  And so finally, inevitably, the Biden administration has caved. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=337.18s)]
*  Turns out even trying to maintain basic public health standards is unacceptable if it gets [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=341.38s)]
*  in the way of increasing mass immigration. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=346.22s)]
*  Title 42 is being nullified. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=348.1s)]
*  A similar rule, but you should know, will still apply to you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  American citizens are not exempt. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=352.66s)]
*  To this day, you as a citizen are not allowed to return to the United States without permission [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=354.54s)]
*  from the CDC. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=358.88s)]
*  Michelle Walensky will sign off on that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=359.88s)]
*  So coming back to the country you were born in is no longer your birthright, but illegal [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=362.02s)]
*  aliens now face no barriers at all. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=366.78s)]
*  And of course, they know it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  Everyone knows it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=372.09999999999997s)]
*  It's not their fault. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  It's our president's fault. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=374.38s)]
*  According to Axios, quote, U.S. intelligence officials are privately bracing for a massive [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=376.94s)]
*  influx of more than 170,000 migrants at the Mexico border now that Title 42 is ending. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=381.56s)]
*  So the wave grows. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=389.46s)]
*  The total transformation of this country accelerates. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=390.78s)]
*  So we've been very passive in the face of this. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=395.66s)]
*  People make grumpy noises about it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=397.74s)]
*  No one's done anything. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=399.18s)]
*  How should we respond? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=400.22s)]
*  Well, the same way we respond to any other invasion with the U.S. military. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=401.22s)]
*  That's why countries have militaries to stop invasions. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=407.3s)]
*  And this would not be a hard invasion to stop. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  Our military could seal the border with Mexico in days. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=413.6s)]
*  That would save American lives. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=417.06s)]
*  It would restore order. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=418.22s)]
*  And it would end the invasion. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  Does that sound crazy? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=422.1s)]
*  Like a misuse of the U.S. military? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=424.64s)]
*  Well, keep in mind that Nancy Pelosi called in the U.S. military to protect her from Trump [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=426.4s)]
*  voters at the U.S. Capitol. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  She treated our soldiers like her personal security detail. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=433.0s)]
*  And then, of course, at this very moment, we are sending thousands of American troops [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=436.7s)]
*  and billions in American military hardware to Eastern Europe to help the Ukrainians restore [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  their borders. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=445.46s)]
*  So the obvious question is, why not here? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=447.08s)]
*  Why not take America's safety, your family's safety, as seriously as Nancy Pelosi takes [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=451.91999999999996s)]
*  her own safety? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=456.96s)]
*  That seems like a fair question. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=459.2s)]
*  Probably not Russian disinformation. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=460.84s)]
*  Probably an honest question. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=463.08s)]
*  We spoke to Congresswoman Maria Salazar of Miami last night, and we asked that question [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=464.91999999999996s)]
*  of her. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=468.08s)]
*  She refused to answer. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=469.28s)]
*  Watch how she refused. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=470.44s)]
*  I just can't help notice the contrast between your desire to send MiGs to Ukraine to preserve [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=472.4s)]
*  its borders, but not here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  Should we send the U.S. military to the Mexican border, since you have admitted that tens [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=479.08s)]
*  of millions of people have come here illegally, that our borders are porous, they're not [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  defended, they're open? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=486.28s)]
*  Should we send the U.S. military to the Mexican border? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=487.96s)]
*  That is what I have created a whole plan so we can really seal the border, because you [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=491.24s)]
*  know what? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=496.36s)]
*  My community, the one that I represent— [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=497.36s)]
*  Would you call for sending— [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=498.36s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=499.36s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=500.36s)]
*  You represent America, if I could say? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=501.36s)]
*  I'm asking a question about borders. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=502.36s)]
*  All of us are appalled by the violation of Ukraine's borders. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=504.52s)]
*  You don't seem appalled by the violation of our borders, by tens of millions of people. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=508.44s)]
*  So let me ask you for the third time. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=511.96s)]
*  Sure, I do. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=513.32s)]
*  That's a major representation. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=514.32s)]
*  You support military equipment— [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=515.32s)]
*  Okay, then would you support the U.S. military securing the United States border tonight, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=516.32s)]
*  or on the same timetable as sending MiGs to Ukraine? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=522.44s)]
*  How about that? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=524.68s)]
*  That's hypothetical again. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=527.0s)]
*  Oh, it's hypothetical. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=528.48s)]
*  I've got a plan! [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=530.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=532.48s)]
*  What plans have you heard about from Republicans for say the past 25 years? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=533.48s)]
*  Many, many, many. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=538.72s)]
*  To restate, this is a highly dangerous situation that the Biden administration has placed our [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=541.24s)]
*  country in. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  Mexico, whatever its merits, is in the middle of a war. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  Not a new war, a war that has raged on for more than a decade, a war that has likely [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=554.52s)]
*  killed more than 100,000 people so far. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=558.4s)]
*  You're seeing footage on your screen right now of trucks burning in the town of Nueva [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=562.08s)]
*  Laredo. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=565.44s)]
*  That's just feet from the U.S. border in the state of Texas. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=566.44s)]
*  What you're looking at is the aftermath of a three-hour gun battle between cartels and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=569.44s)]
*  government forces. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=573.84s)]
*  You'll notice the situation there is so chaotic that the trucks just burn in the middle of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=574.84s)]
*  the road. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=580.04s)]
*  No one comes to put out the fires to restore order to arrest anyone. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=581.14s)]
*  So that's not a law enforcement action. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=585.84s)]
*  That's a war. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=588.44s)]
*  That's what wars are like. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=589.68s)]
*  A few years ago, the Sinaloa Cartel used heavy machine guns and armored vehicles to win a [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=591.36s)]
*  pitched battle against the Mexican military. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=595.48s)]
*  That's a war, a civil war, feet from our border. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=600.1600000000001s)]
*  That's the country Joe Biden opened our border to. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=605.4000000000001s)]
*  It's insanity. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=608.2s)]
*  And yet somehow, our Congress cannot be bothered to notice this. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  Any of it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=613.36s)]
*  Even as millions stream across. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  Murder victims in Houston apparently don't have influential social media accounts, so [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=617.08s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy doesn't know that they exist. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=620.72s)]
*  And that's a shame, because when he sees it on TikTok, he acts. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=623.24s)]
*  Here's McCarthy demanding we send military equipment across the world to stop the invasion [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=627.76s)]
*  of another country. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=632.2s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=633.2s)]
*  When you think about what President Biden should do, I think there's a bipartisan movement [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=634.2s)]
*  right here. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=640.2s)]
*  Provide them the mix. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=641.36s)]
*  Provide them the planes where they can create a no-fly zone. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=643.24s)]
*  Provide them the armament that they need to continue to fight a war that they did not [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=646.08s)]
*  create. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=654.12s)]
*  So McCarthy says of the Ukrainians, it's a war they didn't create. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=655.12s)]
*  And that is certainly true. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=660.0s)]
*  The Ukrainians did not create that war. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=661.0s)]
*  The Ukrainians did not invade their own country. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=662.64s)]
*  But we didn't either. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=666.2800000000001s)]
*  We didn't invade our own country. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=667.88s)]
*  Very few Americans wanted to open our border to a narco state in the middle of a drug war. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=670.12s)]
*  Joe Biden did that to us. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=675.72s)]
*  And no one cares. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=678.48s)]
*  So maybe we need our own Zelensky to get the world's attention and stop the invasion of [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=680.52s)]
*  America. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=685.0s)]
*  Who will that be? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHBO89xX08&t=686.0s)]
