# Tucker: There is something really wrong
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=0.0s)]
*  In the past 10 days, two separate teenage boys [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=2.6s)]
*  have committed horrifying massacres in public places. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=5.7s)]
*  On May 14th, 18-year-old Peyton Gendron murdered 10 shoppers [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=9.24s)]
*  in a grocery store in Buffalo. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=13.0s)]
*  And then yesterday, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=14.84s)]
*  killed 19 small children and two teachers [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=17.32s)]
*  at an elementary school in Texas. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=20.0s)]
*  Both Gendron and Ramos were very obviously mentally ill. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=22.52s)]
*  The people around them knew that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=25.6s)]
*  Both killers had told other people [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=27.54s)]
*  they planned to commit a mass shooting, and then they did. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=29.4s)]
*  So what can we learn from this? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Well, the first most obvious answer [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=34.06s)]
*  is that the system in place didn't work. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Gendron's teacher sent him to a mental hospital [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=38.2s)]
*  for evaluation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=40.42s)]
*  They knew he was a threat. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=41.4s)]
*  They tried their best. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=43.14s)]
*  He committed a massacre anyway. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=44.28s)]
*  So we know for a fact that what we're doing isn't working. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  But we should also be honest enough to acknowledge [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=49.44s)]
*  that it's very hard to know what to do instead. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=51.86s)]
*  Despite what you may have heard, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=55.04s)]
*  the problem isn't that we don't care enough. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=56.12s)]
*  There's not a person in this country [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=58.8s)]
*  who was not horrified by the sight of murdered children. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=60.279999999999994s)]
*  It's the worst thing, and everybody thinks that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  The problem is that the human mind is much more complex [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=65.78s)]
*  and harder to control than we like to admit. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=69.06s)]
*  A person who is intent on committing violence [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=72.12s)]
*  is very hard to stop under any circumstances. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=74.36s)]
*  An act of Congress isn't gonna do it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=77.52s)]
*  Neither will gun control. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  There are more guns in this country than there are people. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=80.92s)]
*  There always have been. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=83.6s)]
*  However you feel about that fact, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=85.24s)]
*  you can acknowledge that we will never get rid [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=86.84s)]
*  of all of those guns. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=88.52s)]
*  The Constitution prohibits that, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  and you would set off a civil war if you tried to do it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=91.2s)]
*  So gun control, whether you find the slogans appealing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  or not, will not stop the next patron, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=96.34s)]
*  Gendron or Salvador Ramos, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=98.64s)]
*  and every rational person knows it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=100.24s)]
*  The only way to stop these killings is to figure out [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  why American society is producing so many violent young men. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  There is a reason they are acting this way. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=109.38s)]
*  What is that reason? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  And it's not just mass shooters, by the way, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  the ones you see on television. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=114.88s)]
*  It's gang bangers and carjackers and armed robbers [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=116.28s)]
*  and indiscriminate haters who push strangers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=119.12s)]
*  in front of subway trains. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=121.12s)]
*  We have a lot of people like that in this country [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=122.76s)]
*  all of a sudden more than you'd like to think about. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=124.84s)]
*  Why are they acting this way? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=127.4s)]
*  That's the only question that matters. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=129.96s)]
*  Of course, it's the only question our leaders hate to address [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=132.08s)]
*  because there's nothing in it for them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=134.48s)]
*  Last night, the President of the United States [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  went on television just hours [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=138.58s)]
*  after 19 small children had been murdered. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=140.16s)]
*  He didn't do that to uplift or unite the country, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=143.0s)]
*  which was already united in its sorrow. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=146.4s)]
*  Instead, he took the opportunity to once again [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=148.88s)]
*  harangue anyone who didn't vote for him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  And he did it as always with a series of stale talking points [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  left over from the 1980s. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=156.72s)]
*  It was a shameful display. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  As a nation, we have to ask, when in God's name [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=162.4s)]
*  are we gonna stand up to the gun lobby? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  When in God's name we do what we all know [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=169.96s)]
*  and our gut needs to be done, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=173.56s)]
*  what in God's name do you need a solvent for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=175.72s)]
*  except to kill someone? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=178.24s)]
*  Durer aren't running through the forest with Kevlar vests on, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=181.4s)]
*  for God's sake. It's just sick. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  And the gun manufacturers have spent two decades [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  aggressively marking assault weapons, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  which make them the most and largest profit. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=195.16s)]
*  For God's sake, we have to have the courage [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=197.84s)]
*  to stand up to the industry. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=199.6s)]
*  Children are dying because the gun lobby is profiting. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=202.36s)]
*  It's disgusting, he would say something like that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=206.24s)]
*  It's also untrue. It's mindless. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=208.24s)]
*  The New York Times, by the way, said the same thing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=210.0s)]
*  within hours of the shooting, the gun lobby, please. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=211.68s)]
*  The NRA declared bankruptcy last year. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=215.88s)]
*  The NRA is a husk. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=218.84s)]
*  In 2021, for example, the tech company [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=221.12s)]
*  spent more than $70 million lobbying Congress. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  Big Pharma spent 92 million lobbying Congress [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=226.83999999999997s)]
*  in the first quarter of 2021 alone. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  The NRA spent just 2.2 million total lobbying [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  in all of 2020, a presidential election year. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  Spare us. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  Whatever the problem is, it's not the gun lobby. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  They're not the reason those children [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  were murdered yesterday. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=246.32s)]
*  It's insulting and divisive and stupid. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  This is too serious a moment for nonsense like that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=250.56s)]
*  Stop. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=253.04s)]
*  But over at MSNBC, they were completely convinced. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=253.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=256.04s)]
*  And again, as President Biden said, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=256.88s)]
*  I thought he did an extraordinary job last night. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=259.08s)]
*  And I really do. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=262.56s)]
*  I feel sorry for those who actually saw that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=263.68s)]
*  and were actually forced to say something really [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=268.44s)]
*  about him after he did it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=271.44s)]
*  I mean, that that's how they make their money. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=273.52s)]
*  It really makes me really sad for them [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=276.12s)]
*  that they have that dark side to them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  That they have that dark of a soul. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=282.68s)]
*  That they're that twisted. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=284.6s)]
*  Oh, Joe Scarborough said a naughty word on TV. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=287.32s)]
*  This must be serious. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=289.48s)]
*  And in fact, it is very serious. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=291.6s)]
*  In fact, it's too serious for tired partisan platitudes [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  from the Reagan era. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  Update your profile. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  Politicians offering solutions to the tragedy [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=299.6s)]
*  that in the end serve only to make their political party [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=302.0s)]
*  more powerful should be excluded from this conversation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=304.12s)]
*  It is too important. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=308.48s)]
*  They are speaking in bad faith, obviously. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=309.32s)]
*  And so is anyone whose bodyguards carry extended magazines [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=311.8s)]
*  or other so-called weapons of war. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=314.68s)]
*  They're hypocrites. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=317.0s)]
*  They have no standing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=317.84s)]
*  Get back to us when you follow your own demands. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=319.2s)]
*  And anyone on TV who's been accused of a crime [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=321.76s)]
*  should also take this opportunity to be very quiet. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=323.84s)]
*  No one wants a moral lecture from you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=325.8s)]
*  But unfortunately, that's essentially all we're getting. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=328.08s)]
*  More wind. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=330.52s)]
*  At a time when we need more than that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=332.12s)]
*  Beto O'Rourke who's running for office again [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=334.12s)]
*  because he has no marketable skills, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=336.32s)]
*  just stormed a press conference to berate Texas officials. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=338.0s)]
*  He did this in front of the families [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  of some of yesterday's victims. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=343.12s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=345.32s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=346.88s)]

*  This isn't the place to talk to us over. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=362.48s)]

*  Sir, you're out of line. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=365.88s)]

*  Please leave this auditorium. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=371.52s)]
*  I can't believe you're a sick son of a bitch [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=376.68s)]
*  that would come to a deal like this [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=378.68s)]
*  to make a political issue. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=380.0s)]
*  It's only a bitch like you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=383.2s)]
*  Why don't you get out of here? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=384.48s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=386.04s)]
*  That's saving lives. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=387.04s)]
*  That's making this a better country. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=388.08s)]
*  Beto O'Rourke sounds like one of those lunatics [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=389.64s)]
*  from the Westboro Baptist Church [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=391.2s)]
*  gets off on making a scene. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=393.16s)]
*  But that's essentially the answer we've gotten [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=394.52s)]
*  to how to fix and prevent what happened in Uvalde. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=397.56s)]
*  Please, anyone who talks like this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=401.28s)]
*  should be quiet for a minute [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  and leave it to everybody else [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  to figure out why this is happening. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=406.56s)]
*  And this is bigger than a single mass shooting [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  or even two of them in 10 days. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=410.64s)]
*  There has been a huge increase in violence in America [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  on our streets, on public transportation, in our schools. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=414.52s)]
*  It's not a guess, it's measurable. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  From January 1st to April 10th of this year, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=419.4s)]
*  robberies in the New York transit system [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  are up more than 70% year over year. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=423.2s)]
*  Felony assaults in the subway have increased by 28%. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=426.56s)]
*  Grand larceny, according to the NYPD, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  is up by more than 100%. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=431.24s)]
*  Those are all crimes of violence. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=433.08s)]
*  And that's just underground. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=435.32s)]
*  The same thing is happening on the streets. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=437.84s)]
*  And if you don't know it, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=439.32s)]
*  you just got back to the country after a while. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=440.72s)]
*  According to ABC News, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=442.68s)]
*  about 11% of violent crime in the city of Los Angeles [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=444.0s)]
*  involved a homeless person in 2018, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=446.56s)]
*  13% in 2019, and 15% in 2020. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=448.96s)]
*  If that was a graph, it would look like that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=453.2s)]
*  Keep in mind, the homeless make up about 1% [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=455.52s)]
*  of the total population of Los Angeles, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=458.32s)]
*  but they're involved in nearly a fifth [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=460.28s)]
*  of all violent crimes in the city. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=461.76s)]
*  Oh, but ignore it, it's not happening. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=463.12s)]
*  And yet everyone who lives here knows that it is happening [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=465.68s)]
*  because the numbers go up every year. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  And if you have kids, you know it's happening [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=469.56s)]
*  because it's the same story in the schools. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=470.84s)]
*  The executive director of the National Association [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=472.91999999999996s)]
*  of School Resource Officers, Moe Kennedy, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=474.64s)]
*  told Fox Business that schools are, quote, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  seeing more aggression in terms of fights. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes they're shoving matches, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=480.84s)]
*  and sometimes they're flat out assaults. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  It's more misbehavior, thefts, and those kinds of things. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=484.72s)]
*  In schools, it didn't used to happen, it's happening now. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=487.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=491.16s)]
*  It's not guns, it's not the gun lobby. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=492.24s)]
*  More American families had guns at home 50 years ago [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=494.8s)]
*  than they do now. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=497.6s)]
*  According to the Rand Corporation, which studied this, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=498.52s)]
*  45% of American homes had a gun in 1980. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=500.92s)]
*  In 2016, that had dropped to 32%. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=504.68s)]
*  So the problem is not that we're more armed than we were, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=508.36s)]
*  the problem is that people have changed. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=510.36s)]
*  Young men have changed, they're more violent. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=512.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=515.36s)]
*  That's the bipartisan conversation we need to have now. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=517.0s)]
*  And that conversation has been drowned out [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=520.6s)]
*  by lunatic attention seekers [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=523.5200000000001s)]
*  who are hoping to win the next election. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=525.5200000000001s)]
*  But we don't need them now. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=528.4000000000001s)]
*  Never mind your election. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=530.2800000000001s)]
*  There's something really wrong, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=533.2800000000001s)]
*  and we can figure it out if we try. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=534.88s)]
*  There are probably a lot of causes. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=538.0600000000001s)]
*  The use of antidepressants in this country [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=540.62s)]
*  is increasing dramatically. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=542.7s)]
*  Between 1991 and 2018, total SSRI consumption [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=543.94s)]
*  increased in the US by more than 3000%. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=547.82s)]
*  3000%. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=551.46s)]
*  Remember, these are supposed to reduce mental illness. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=553.94s)]
*  Now that's a real stat. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=556.86s)]
*  It was published by the medical journal, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=557.7s)]
*  Science of the Total Environment. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=558.74s)]
*  And it's not just this country, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=560.62s)]
*  in Canada, state-funded antidepressant prescriptions [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=561.54s)]
*  for young people doubled over the last decade. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=563.86s)]
*  Then during the lockdowns, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=567.3s)]
*  SSRI prescriptions increased even more. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=568.78s)]
*  A pharmacy group called Express Scripts [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=572.06s)]
*  reported that antidepressant prescriptions [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=573.6999999999999s)]
*  went up by more than 20% during COVID. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=575.42s)]
*  According to the latest figures, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=578.3399999999999s)]
*  more than 40 million Americans [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=579.38s)]
*  are now taking psychoactive drugs. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=581.54s)]
*  That's roughly one in 10. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=582.98s)]
*  So again, the point of these drugs [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=585.14s)]
*  is to make you healthier mentally, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=586.6999999999999s)]
*  to reduce suicide and violence. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=589.54s)]
*  And yet suicide rates and rates of violence are spiking. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  We don't know that that's causation, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=596.6s)]
*  but it's worth looking at. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=598.4s)]
*  Of course, it's immoral to criticize big pharma, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=600.48s)]
*  could we use an honest conversation about this? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=602.36s)]
*  Yes, immediately. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=604.72s)]
*  Clearly something's going on. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=609.16s)]
*  Three major medical associations, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=610.0s)]
*  including the American Academy of Pediatrics, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=611.6s)]
*  have together declared a national state of emergency [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=614.16s)]
*  in children's mental health caused by COVID. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=616.8s)]
*  Parents report grief, anxiety, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=619.84s)]

*  citing school closures and forced isolations [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=623.72s)]
*  as the primary culprits. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=626.36s)]
*  Suicide attempts among adolescents are rising sharply, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=627.68s)]
*  most acutely among 12 to 17-year-old girls [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=630.56s)]
*  by 51% since the start of the pandemic. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=633.64s)]
*  Oh, so the lockdowns dramatically increase [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=637.5s)]
*  the incidence of mental illness among young people, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  and in 10 days we've seen two mass shootings [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=642.36s)]
*  by mentally ill young people. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=644.48s)]
*  Could there be a connection? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=645.64s)]
*  Now that's not finger pointing, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=646.9s)]
*  it's not to blame Fauci for yesterday's shooting. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=648.0s)]
*  We're not that low, we're not Joe Biden. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=650.88s)]
*  But if people are becoming mentally ill [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=654.2s)]
*  because they're disconnected from others, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=656.28s)]
*  what can we do to connect them to others [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=658.8399999999999s)]
*  and thereby reduce the incidence of mental illness? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=661.64s)]
*  That's a real conversation. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  Is there a more important one? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, more than 100,000 people just died of O.D.'s, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=668.0s)]
*  and the pandemic is responsible for some of that. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=671.18s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=674.28s)]
*  New numbers out today from the CDC [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=675.92s)]
*  show how drug overdoses have surged during the pandemic. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=677.9599999999999s)]
*  More than 107,000 Americans died [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=681.56s)]
*  of drug overdoses in 2021. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=684.28s)]
*  That's the highest annual death toll ever recorded, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=686.72s)]
*  and a 15% increase from the year before. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=689.56s)]
*  Deaths involving fentanyl, meth, and cocaine rose sharply. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=692.8s)]
*  Okay, so people are doing more drugs, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=698.8s)]
*  they're more unstable, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  they're killing themselves more often, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  and in some rare cases, they're killing others. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=704.0s)]
*  Now what kind of mindset would it take [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=706.64s)]
*  to go murder children in an elementary school? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=708.48s)]
*  You are so disconnected from other human beings [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=711.3s)]
*  that that seems okay to you. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=714.26s)]
*  What could be adding to the feeling of disconnection [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=716.46s)]
*  we have from one another? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=719.52s)]
*  Well, in 2020, adults in the United States [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=721.62s)]
*  spent an average of eight hours every day [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=724.7s)]
*  on digital media, staring at a screen. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=727.62s)]
*  The lockdowns made it worse. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=729.7s)]
*  They're not the only cause, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=730.88s)]
*  but they definitely exacerbated it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=731.8s)]
*  That's a 20% jump from 2019. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=733.2s)]
*  One of the people who spent an awful lot of time online [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=737.3s)]
*  during the pandemic was the shooter in Uvalde. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=739.58s)]
*  He reportedly played a lot of Call of Duty, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=741.9399999999999s)]
*  instead of going outside. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=744.18s)]
*  The shooter in Buffalo also spent a lot of time online [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=745.8s)]
*  as well, in fact, he blamed the internet [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=748.5s)]
*  for radicalizing him. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=750.8599999999999s)]
*  I spent almost a year planning this attack, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=753.06s)]
*  he wrote on April 26th. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=754.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh, how time flies, if I could go back, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=756.06s)]
*  maybe I'd tell myself to get the F off 4chan [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=757.6999999999999s)]
*  and the World Truth videos and get an actual life. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=760.38s)]
*  Too late for that now. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=762.54s)]
*  Now, that's not an argument for censoring those [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=764.5s)]
*  or any other sites, it's an argument [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=766.8599999999999s)]
*  for experiencing real life, nature, other people, animals, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=768.9799999999999s)]
*  anything but a screen. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=772.8s)]
*  Staring at a screen all day puts you into your own world [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  and in some small number of cases, it drives you insane. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=777.12s)]
*  It makes you mentally ill and violent. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=780.34s)]
*  That's very obvious. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=781.68s)]
*  That's one of the reasons that people in Silicon Valley, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=782.92s)]
*  the tech executives don't let their own kids [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=784.96s)]
*  lose themselves in their stupid iPads. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=786.8199999999999s)]
*  Back in September of 2013, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=790.16s)]
*  after a mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=792.08s)]
*  the late Charles Krauthammer identified the problem. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=793.8199999999999s)]
*  We have a lot of mentally ill people [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=796.9399999999999s)]
*  and we need to stop ignoring them. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=799.2s)]
*  Obviously we've ignored that warning, so here it is again. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=801.76s)]
*  He needed help. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=805.56s)]
*  30 years ago, the cops would have brought him [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=806.96s)]
*  to a psychiatric emergency room. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=809.76s)]
*  He probably would have gotten antipsychotics [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=812.0s)]
*  and he probably would have been hospitalized [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=813.96s)]
*  for a couple of weeks. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=816.48s)]
*  That's the way it was done in the 70s [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=817.68s)]
*  when I practiced psychiatry. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=821.08s)]
*  But today, that doesn't happen. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=822.5s)]
*  The cops left, he was left on his own. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=824.84s)]
*  He was a man who shouldn't have been on his own. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=827.8s)]
*  He should have had the state looking after him [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=830.08s)]
*  and he ended up killing people in a way that's, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=832.48s)]
*  look, you wanna respect the civil liberties of everybody, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=835.0s)]
*  but there is a point in which if you don't take control [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=838.04s)]
*  of people who are clearly out of touch with reality, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=841.08s)]
*  you are damaging them, exposing them, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=844.64s)]
*  and of course, tragically, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=846.88s)]
*  exposing a lot of innocence around them. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=848.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=852.1s)]
*  The stuff is complicated. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=854.84s)]
*  The human mind is complicated. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=855.88s)]
*  And if the environment changes, so does the mind. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=857.92s)]
*  People can't go outside or talk to other people [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=860.88s)]
*  or spend eight hours a day staring at a screen. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=862.56s)]
*  If they're on brain changing chemicals in huge numbers, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=866.2199999999999s)]
*  tens of millions of people, you think that has an effect? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=870.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=872.68s)]
*  What effect? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=874.36s)]
*  Well, is anyone studying what murderers, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=875.1999999999999s)]
*  not just mass murderers, but all murderers have in common? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=877.4s)]
*  Apparently not, it would be nice to know. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=881.0799999999999s)]
*  Instead of telling us about the gun lobby. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=883.56s)]
*  Please, no one believes that. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=886.4s)]
*  And why, by the way, is the answer to mass shootings [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=888.8s)]
*  always universal gun confiscation? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=890.88s)]
*  Shouldn't we be focused on the people who did it, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=892.72s)]
*  on the dangerous people? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=894.5799999999999s)]
*  It's like forcing the entire population into drug rehab [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=896.76s)]
*  in response to the fentanyl crisis. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=899.56s)]
*  Probably better to focus on the addicts. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=901.1999999999999s)]
*  Why did they get addicted? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=902.52s)]
*  How can we help them? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=903.38s)]
*  Let's be serious about this. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=904.68s)]
*  Children died, it's real. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=906.52s)]
*  Stop with the talking points, be honest. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=908.36s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8wgo3iI18&t=911.1999999999999s)]
