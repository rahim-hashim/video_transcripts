# Tucker: This is terrifying and unnerving
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs)
*  In the meantime, tonight, the Kyle Rittenhouse trial continued today in Wisconsin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=0.0s)]
*  In a move that surprised lawyers everywhere, Rittenhouse took the stand in his own defense. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=3.92s)]
*  That is unusual in criminal cases, and it's especially unusual in murder trials. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=8.28s)]
*  And the reason is simple, the stakes are too high. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=12.24s)]
*  One wrong answer in a cross-examination, and you could wind up spending life in prison. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=14.16s)]
*  But this case was different. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=18.68s)]
*  By the time he testified today, Kyle Rittenhouse had already won the case. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=20.32s)]
*  At this point, there was no remaining doubt that Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self-defense [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=24.6s)]
*  during the riots last summer in Kenosha. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=28.9s)]
*  Every shot Rittenhouse fired was captured on videotape and from multiple angles. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=31.299999999999997s)]
*  Every single witness who testified this week at the trial confirmed exactly what happened. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  And here are the facts of it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=40.46s)]
*  A convicted child rapist called Joseph Rosenbaum was released from a mental hospital and then [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=41.9s)]
*  went directly to join the mob that was burning downtown Kenosha. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=47.22s)]
*  Once he got to the riot, Rosenbaum saw Kyle Rittenhouse and immediately threatened to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=51.22s)]
*  kill him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=55.54s)]
*  Rosenbaum then chased Rittenhouse and tried to pull the gun from his hands. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=56.78s)]
*  When he did that, Kyle Rittenhouse shot him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=60.46s)]
*  So Joseph Rosenbaum died as he had lived, trying to touch an unwilling minor. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=63.22s)]
*  At this point, Rittenhouse ran to find police. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  A mob then chased him down the street, howling for his death. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=71.34s)]
*  A rioter jumped on Rittenhouse and knocked him to the ground. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=74.58s)]
*  Another smashed him in the face with a skateboard. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=77.26s)]
*  Yet another drew a loaded gun and pointed it in his face. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=79.54s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse shot the second two men, one of them fatally. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=82.86s)]
*  So those are the facts. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=86.72s)]
*  And there's no way to interpret them except for what they are, the exercise of self-defense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=87.72s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse shot people so he would not be killed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=93.0s)]
*  But if you take a step back from the Rittenhouse story, you see something else entirely. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=97.08s)]
*  You see violent insanity completely out of control in the middle of an American city. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=100.68s)]
*  And the question is, how did that happen in our country? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=105.64s)]
*  And why did nobody stop it? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=108.32s)]
*  And it wasn't just happening in Kenosha, of course. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=109.56s)]
*  Violent mobs at the same moment overwhelmed New York and Minneapolis and Portland and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=111.86s)]
*  many other cities. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=115.28s)]
*  They killed at least a dozen people. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=116.68s)]
*  They caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  They burned businesses. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=121.22000000000001s)]
*  They torched police stations. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=122.22000000000001s)]
*  They bombed courthouses. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=123.76s)]
*  They invaded suburban neighborhoods in the middle of the night purely to intimidate people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=125.0s)]
*  because of their race. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  Democrats applauded all of this as it happened. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=130.88s)]
*  Most Republicans just ignored it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=133.34s)]
*  And of course, the media lied about it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=135.08s)]
*  In Kenosha, the police barely even showed up. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=137.24s)]
*  Officers in armored cruisers sat and watched as rioters torched a car lot with more than [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=140.24s)]
*  100 vehicles in it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=144.32s)]
*  And they did nothing to stop the chaos. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=145.92s)]
*  The question then is, how exactly are we surprised when a 17-year-old lifeguard from Illinois [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=148.68s)]
*  decides to step in? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=153.28s)]
*  They hate it when you say that, but it's an entirely fair question. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=155.12s)]
*  When legitimate authority refuses to do its duty, its sworn duty, others will fill the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=158.4s)]
*  vacuum. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  That is always true. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=164.6s)]
*  It's a physics principle. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=165.6s)]
*  But rather than acknowledge that obvious truth and accept the responsibility they bear, the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=167.32s)]
*  people who made these riots possible in the first place decided instead to crush Kyle [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=171.88s)]
*  Rittenhouse. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=175.96s)]
*  Joe Biden publicly called him a white supremacist, something for which someday we very much hope [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=177.24s)]
*  he is sued because it's totally outrageous and false. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=181.6s)]
*  Members of Congress called him a domestic terrorist. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=184.92s)]
*  Today, Kyle Rittenhouse spoke for himself. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=187.32s)]
*  See what you think. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=190.84s)]
*  Once I take that step back, I look over my shoulder and Mr. Rosenbaum, Mr. Rosenbaum [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=191.84s)]
*  was now running from my right side and I was cornered from in front of me with Mr. Zeminski [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=201.28s)]
*  and there were... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=216.48s)]
*  There were people right there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=225.44s)]
*  Make a deep breath, Kyle. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=231.2s)]
*  So after a 10 minute break to compose himself, Kyle Rittenhouse returned to the courtroom [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  and proceeded to blow up the prosecution's claim that he had racked his rifle in a threatening [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=241.48s)]
*  manner. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  It turns out he didn't rack his rifle at all and video proved that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  And then Rittenhouse explained why he turned himself in to police after the shootings. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=252.32s)]
*  People were saying cranium him and get him, kill him. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=257.68s)]
*  People were screaming and I just was trying to get to the police running down Sheridan [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  Road. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=266.56s)]
*  And you say I'm trying to get to the police. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=267.56s)]
*  Why were you trying to get to the police? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Because I didn't do anything wrong. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  I defended myself. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=272.32s)]
*  Did you feel as though there was safety where the police were? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=273.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=278.16s)]
*  So they didn't really have a response to that since it's all on videotape. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=280.16s)]
*  It's provably true. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=283.88s)]
*  So instead the lead prosecutor in the case, in today's case, who is essentially an NPR [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=285.52s)]
*  pledge drive donor called Thomas Binger, took a very different tack. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=291.96s)]
*  He went on to imply that Kyle Rittenhouse must be guilty because he had exercised his [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=295.4s)]
*  constitutional right to remain silent after he was arrested. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=299.79999999999995s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=302.84s)]
*  Since August 25th, 2020, this is the first time that you have told your story. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=307.16s)]
*  Since August 25th, 2020, you've had the benefit of watching countless videos of your actions [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=320.92s)]
*  that night, correct? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=328.14000000000004s)]
*  You've also had the opportunity to listen to the testimony of all 30-some witnesses [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=330.12s)]
*  that have testified in this trial so far, correct? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=336.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  And after all of that now, you are telling us your side of the story, correct? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  I am making the point that after hearing everything in the case, now he's tailoring his story [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=345.79999999999995s)]
*  to what has already been introduced. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  The problem is, this is a grave constitutional violation for you to talk about the defendants' [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=355.08s)]
*  silence. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=362.84s)]
*  That is, and you're right on the borderline. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=365.36s)]
*  And you may be over, but it better stop. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  Understood. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=378.12s)]
*  Yeah, this is day one of law school stuff, but just to be clear, exercising your constitutional [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=379.12s)]
*  rights is not an indication that you are guilty. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=384.08s)]
*  It is a sign that you are American. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=387.44s)]
*  It is your birthright. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=390.52s)]
*  The government's own lawyer does not understand that, which you think might get the attention [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=392.18s)]
*  of Merrick Garland's Justice Department, which after all is in charge of justice in this [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=395.94s)]
*  country. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=400.18s)]
*  But no, Merrick Garland is not interested, just as he has ignored the thugs videotaping [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=401.18s)]
*  jurors outside the courthouse. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=405.98s)]
*  The judge in this case seems pretty well fed up with all of it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  Today he ruled that prosecutors could not mention statements about shoplifters that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=411.26s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse apparently made weeks before the shootings. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=415.06s)]
*  Prosecutors asked Rittenhouse about them anyway, and once again the judge was forced to shut [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=418.68s)]
*  down the trial. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=422.06s)]
*  I indicated a bias towards denial is what I did. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=424.26s)]
*  Held it open with a bias towards denial. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=427.74s)]
*  Why would you think that that made it okay for you without any advance notice to bring [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=430.38s)]
*  this matter before the jury? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=435.46s)]
*  You are already, you were, I was astonished when you began your examination by commenting [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=438.42s)]
*  on the defendant's post arrest silence. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=445.7s)]
*  That's basic law. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=449.5s)]
*  That's been basic law in this country for 40 years, 50 years. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=450.94s)]
*  I have no idea why you would do something like that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=454.14s)]
*  And it gives, well, I'll leave it at that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=457.02s)]
*  So I don't know what you're up to. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=461.42s)]
*  You could watch televised trials for the next 10 years and never hear a judge talk like [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=464.08s)]
*  that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=468.22s)]
*  That's how completely out of control the prosecution in this case is. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=469.22s)]
*  At this point it's not even clear it's going to make it to a jury. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=472.26s)]
*  The defense has asked the judge to dismiss the case without the possibility of retrial, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=475.38s)]
*  and the judge indicated he might very well grant that request. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=479.18s)]
*  So again, what you are watching is willful prosecutorial misconduct. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=482.34s)]
*  It's an intentional perversion of justice, and the judge very well knows that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=486.38s)]
*  I heard nothing in this trial to change any of my rulings. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=491.97999999999996s)]
*  So why- [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  That was before the defense testimony, Your Honor. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=496.53999999999996s)]
*  Pardon me? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=497.53999999999996s)]
*  That was before the defense testimony. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=498.53999999999996s)]
*  Don't get brazen with me. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=499.53999999999996s)]
*  You knew very well, you know very well that an attorney can't go into these types of areas [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=502.4s)]
*  when the judge has already ruled without asking outside the presence of the jury to do so. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=508.5s)]
*  So don't give me that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=513.76s)]
*  Yeah, don't give me that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=514.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=516.76s)]
*  Good for the judge. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=517.76s)]
*  We should tell you, we're so used to evaluating everything through a partisan lens that it's [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=518.76s)]
*  worth knowing the judge in this case, that guy, was appointed by a Democrat. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=521.96s)]
*  The point is, however, he still believes in the Constitution. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=526.38s)]
*  That's always the point. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=529.76s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse should be very grateful he's the judge in this case. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=530.76s)]
*  Yesterday the prosecutor tried to bully a freelance photographer called Nathan De Bruin. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=534.38s)]
*  In return, that turned out to be a mistake, De Bruin ratted them out on live television. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=538.9s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=543.18s)]
*  Mr. De Bruin, you said there was a lot of tension in the room when you met with me and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=544.18s)]
*  Mr. Binger and Ms. Beezy. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=550.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=552.86s)]
*  Is it fair to say that you were very nervous? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=553.86s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=556.62s)]
*  And we did have you read over your statement, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=559.42s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=562.22s)]
*  We asked if you knew anything beyond that statement. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=563.22s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=565.6600000000001s)]
*  We didn't ask you to change it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=566.6600000000001s)]
*  Yes you did. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=568.62s)]
*  Yes you did. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=570.62s)]
*  So pressuring a witness to change his statement. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=576.1s)]
*  That's exactly the kind of justice that Kyle Rittenhouse has received from the government [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=577.1s)]
*  so far. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=580.38s)]
*  No one who's been paying attention is surprised by any of this. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=581.5400000000001s)]
*  Ghouls like Joe Biden politicized this case day one. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=584.1s)]
*  What's terrifying and very unnerving to anyone who lives in this country is the number of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=588.94s)]
*  institutions that joined the Democratic Party in trying to prevent Kyle Rittenhouse from [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=592.66s)]
*  getting a fair trial, which again is your birthright as an American. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=597.02s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=599.74s)]
*  In Virginia, a police lieutenant called William Kelly was fired from his job for daring to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=600.8199999999999s)]
*  donate to Kyle Rittenhouse's legal defense. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=605.68s)]
*  Kelly was a 20-year veteran of the Norfolk Police Department. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=608.18s)]
*  He had three children and a wife with cancer. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=610.68s)]
*  For disagreeing with Joe Biden's view of the Rittenhouse case, the department dismissed [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=613.42s)]
*  him without a pension. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=617.8s)]
*  That actually happened. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=619.02s)]
*  In Salt Lake City, a local news station decided to terrorize a paramedic called Craig Shepherd, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=620.58s)]
*  his sin giving $10 to Rittenhouse's legal defense. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=625.38s)]
*  So reporters called Shepherd's employer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=628.94s)]
*  Another reporter showed up at Shepherd's house with a camera crew and then bragged about [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=631.34s)]
*  it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=634.4200000000001s)]
*  Quote, ABC4 News investigator Jason Wynn went to Shepherd's home to get his side of [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=635.4200000000001s)]
*  things, but those inside the home didn't want to talk. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=640.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, wonder why. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=644.22s)]
*  It is shameful and authoritarian, hurting the weak to appease the strong. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=646.78s)]
*  That's the American media, 2021. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=652.5s)]
*  Having watched the trial, no honest person could fail to admit the obvious. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=655.26s)]
*  The media were completely wrong about Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=660.78s)]
*  They slandered an innocent kid, but they're not admitting it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=663.78s)]
*  There is at least one exception though, and we want to highlight that person tonight. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  Her name is Anna Kasparian. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=670.8599999999999s)]
*  She's a lefty. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=672.4599999999999s)]
*  She's on a show called The Young Turks. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=673.4599999999999s)]
*  She hates this show, and most of the time we disagree with her. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=674.74s)]
*  But on the question of this trial, Anna Kasparian was bravely honest and good for her. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=677.62s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=683.02s)]
*  Look, these details matter because if you're going to make an argument that you acted in [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=684.02s)]
*  self-defense, there needs to be some proof that there was an imminent threat. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=689.38s)]
*  Now what really mattered to me was how all of this unfolded. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=695.46s)]
*  What was the thing that sparked it? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=699.38s)]
*  What started all of it? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=700.98s)]
*  And initially I was under the assumption that Rittenhouse was the person who was chasing [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=702.7s)]
*  after Joseph Rosenbaum. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=708.5s)]
*  That that's how it had started. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=711.14s)]
*  But I was wrong about that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=712.94s)]
*  Okay? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=714.34s)]
*  So I want to correct the record. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=715.34s)]
*  I was in fact wrong about that. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=716.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=719.1800000000001s)]
*  You don't see that too often. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=720.5s)]
*  But it's not hard, by the way. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=721.96s)]
*  Tell the truth. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=723.8000000000001s)]
*  Let reality be your guide. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  It feels good. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=727.32s)]
*  That's what decent people do. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=728.7800000000001s)]
*  There are too few of them. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykxlfcErSYs&t=730.4200000000001s)]
