# Tucker: This is the end of the First Amendment
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M)
*  Well, as you've just heard, the Biden administration spends an awful lot of time covering up actual crimes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=0.0s)]
*  crimes committed by their political allies and their relatives. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=4.68s)]
*  But for their critics, there is no such mercy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=7.96s)]
*  For the first time in our history, the government has begun to arrest people for saying things the White House doesn't like. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=10.48s)]
*  That's the end of the First Amendment. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Speech that's been protected for centuries in the United States is no longer protected. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=19.2s)]
*  It's now a criminal act. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=23.36s)]
*  We've told you about the grotesquely unconstitutional prosecution and then conviction of Douglas Mackey. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=25.36s)]
*  The DOJ is trying to send Mackey to prison for a decade for making fun of Hillary Clinton's voters on Twitter. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  The media barely report the story. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=37.84s)]
*  They don't seem to care at all. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=39.32s)]
*  They seem to endorse it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=41.64s)]
*  No one in Congress is meaningfully pushed back against it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  So this trend continues. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=46.2s)]
*  The latest group of Americans to find their constitutionally protected opinions become felonies are, believe it or not, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=47.96s)]
*  an organization of black nationalist left wingers who oppose the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=55.28s)]
*  The DOJ has discharged many in this group with seeking to, quote, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=61.84s)]
*  sow discord, spread pro-Russia propaganda, and interfere in elections within the United States. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=65.04s)]
*  Now, there's no way to say interfere with any election. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=73.12s)]
*  You're allowed to be pro-Russia. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=75.56s)]
*  You're allowed to be pro anything you want in the United States. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=77.08s)]
*  Saying things the government doesn't like, having unfashionable opinions or opinions that are out of step with Joe Biden's opinions, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=80.84s)]
*  that is not a crime. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=86.64s)]
*  You can spread pro-Russia propaganda if you want to. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=88.44s)]
*  You can spread anti-Russia propaganda if you want to. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=91.84s)]
*  You can say whatever you want, but not anymore. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=94.52s)]
*  According to the indictment, the criminals in question, quote, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=99.16s)]
*  wrote articles that contained Russian propaganda and disinformation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Huh? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=106.56s)]
*  They also gave speeches and posted videos that annoyed the State Department. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=107.84s)]
*  Here's one of them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=112.44s)]
*  There's a discussion about Russian military buildup on its border with Ukraine [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=113.92s)]
*  and how this represents a terrible threat to Ukraine by Russians. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=120.4s)]
*  But there is no acknowledgement of the history that took us to this place, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=126.84s)]
*  how the U.S. overthrow participated in facilitating the overthrow of a government in Ukraine [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=131.32s)]
*  that was friendly to the Soviet Union. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=138.56s)]
*  Nor does it talk about the history of this relationship between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=140.52s)]
*  This is an ongoing aggression. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=146.0s)]
*  It did not just start. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=147.56s)]
*  It's been going on for a while, but the U.S. government relies on the ignorance of the people in this country [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=149.0s)]
*  and much of the world that's facilitated by people like Zuckerberg. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=158.64s)]
*  So for whatever it's worth, we're not really sure who that guy is. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  We know he's American. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=166.32s)]
*  Pretty sure that on a lot of issues, we likely would not agree with him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=167.64s)]
*  A lot of what he just said in that video seems to be true. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  But even if it weren't true, even if he was wrong, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=174.48s)]
*  it would still be constitutionally protected speech. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=178.32s)]
*  In a free country, which we had until recently, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  you are allowed by definition to have dumb opinions. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=184.27999999999997s)]
*  Most of us do, but not anymore. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=187.08s)]
*  So that man you just saw is facing 10 years behind bars [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=190.12s)]
*  for expressing views about Ukraine that the Biden administration doesn't want to hear. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  Does no one else think that's terrifying? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  It is terrifying. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  And to that man's credit, whoever he is, he saw it coming. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=202.68s)]
*  Here he is at a rally last month. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  They have declared that black people are so stupid that it takes Russians to tell us that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=208.0s)]
*  I have never known a moment of black freedom for my entire life. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=216.96s)]
*  I have never read of a moment since the beginning of a colonial model projection [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=222.0s)]
*  where black people have been free. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=226.8s)]
*  And yet they are saying that we are working, we are agents of some foreign power [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=229.2s)]
*  because we say black people must be free. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=235.12s)]
*  Okay, again, we're not defending that guy because we agree with all of his views. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=239.28s)]
*  We probably don't. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=243.28s)]
*  That is totally irrelevant. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=245.12s)]
*  Whether you agree with what someone is saying has nothing to do with his right to say it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=247.2s)]
*  Americans are allowed to say what they think is true, period. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  If they take that right away, you are no longer a citizen, you are a slave. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5T1pVKfJ9M&t=257.92s)]
