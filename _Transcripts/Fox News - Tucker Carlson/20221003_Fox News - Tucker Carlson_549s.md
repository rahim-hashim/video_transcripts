# Glenn Greenwald sounds the alarm on a ‘very real threat’ of a nuclear exchange
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0)
*  Buses in New Jersey now have signs warning about radiation poisoning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=0.0s)]
*  Quote, September is National Preparedness Month. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=2.94s)]
*  Do you know what to do in a radiation emergency? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=5.64s)]
*  No, you don't. It doesn't matter. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=8.34s)]
*  This is all make believe. This is all play acting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=10.96s)]
*  If you live in a big metro area, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=14.06s)]
*  there's not anything you're going to do [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=16.78s)]
*  during a nuclear exchange because you're going to be dead, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=19.2s)]
*  along with most other Americans. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=21.42s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of Americans will be dead. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=24.26s)]
*  And those who survive will starve to death [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=27.04s)]
*  because all agriculture will be destroyed, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=29.56s)]
*  along with billions of people around the planet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=32.06s)]
*  So it's time to update your assumptions about the technology here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  These are not the bombs that flattened Nagasaki. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=37.36s)]
*  They are incalculably more powerful. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=41.1s)]
*  You hit New York, you take out Miami. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=44.26s)]
*  So a nuclear war means [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  not that we get to take out the Black Sea Fleet, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=48.84s)]
*  it means the end of the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=51.64s)]
*  And people who work around this stuff understand it, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=55.26s)]
*  and they're really afraid. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=58.04s)]
*  But no one else seems to have any idea. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=59.96s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=62.44s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald has been watching really carefully [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=63.68s)]
*  all of this unfold. His work is on Substack. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=66.34s)]
*  We're happy to have him join us tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=68.72s)]
*  Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=70.4s)]
*  It seems to me, no matter how you feel about Putin, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=72.32s)]
*  you know, or Ukraine, or the justice of the war, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=74.48s)]
*  or anything, the threat, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=77.34s)]
*  the very real, in-your-face threat [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=79.58s)]
*  of a nuclear exchange right now that they're openly talking about [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=83.0s)]
*  would require the media to start telling people, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  hey, this is real, but nobody is. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=89.44s)]
*  And I wonder why that is. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=91.24s)]
*  If you look at the history of American wars, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  Tucker, over the last several decades, they're incredibly similar. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=97.44s)]
*  The way they convince Americans to support U.S. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=100.56s)]
*  role involvement in a war is they personalize a particular leader, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=103.52s)]
*  get us to hate that leader. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=107.88s)]
*  Oh, Saddam Hussein in Iraq is a terrible guy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad in Syria is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  is this tyrannical force, Mullah Omar in Afghanistan [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=115.48s)]
*  is somebody we have to go and take out. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=118.72s)]
*  Gaddafi in Libya. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=120.72s)]
*  Our emotions get up and we say, yeah, we can't. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's go take out these these tyrants. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=124.64s)]
*  And then, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars later [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  and lives lost. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=131.72s)]
*  Polls always show that Americans come to realize [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=133.16s)]
*  that they regard those words as a mistake. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=135.84s)]
*  And the reason is they realize that no benefits came to the United States [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=137.96s)]
*  and American citizens by virtue of U.S. involvement in those wars. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=142.6s)]
*  So let's apply that framework here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  The consensus in Washington is that we are closer to the use of nuclear weapons [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=149.24s)]
*  than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis 60 years ago. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=154.84s)]
*  There is a very real threat of a nuclear exchange or even a direct [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=159.24s)]
*  confrontation with Russia and the United States. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=163.04s)]
*  And over what? Over who governs and rules [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=165.24s)]
*  not even Ukraine, but the Donbass, the eastern region in Ukraine, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  where a majority of people actually identify as ethnic Russians [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  and want to be part of Russia. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  And yet there's almost no debate over whether we should be sending [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=179.28s)]
*  huge amounts of money there and risking the lives of American citizens [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=182.6s)]
*  through the possibility of a nuclear war, because everyone knows that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=186.28s)]
*  the minute you step up and step out of line, there's a horde of people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=189.56s)]
*  ready to call you unpatriotic or a traitor or an admirer of Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=193.6s)]
*  As I know, is being done with our varied segment right this minute [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=199.04s)]
*  by all those media matter people and other people online. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=202.56s)]
*  So it's a really repressive atmosphere and it's squashing a debate [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=205.72s)]
*  that we absolutely have to have. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  But we're losing track of reality. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=211.72s)]
*  If a nation has nuclear weapons and you believe even theoretically [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=213.76s)]
*  they might use them, you have to treat that nation differently. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  You may not want to. It may be unfair. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  But that's why nations seek nuclear weapons, because you can't boss them around. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=222.28s)]
*  If you ignore the possibility [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=225.6s)]
*  that your entire population could be killed, you are not fit for leadership [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=227.4s)]
*  because you're insane. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=230.8s)]
*  And it feels like our leaders are right there. They're insane. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=232.04s)]
*  I think there's almost this sense that has been purposely cultivated [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=237.84s)]
*  to believe that the use of nuclear weapons really isn't a realistic possibility, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  even though we have had the use of nuclear weapons in our in the last century, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  when the US did it in Japan for World War Two. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=252.0s)]
*  And we came very close on at least two or three occasions. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=255.44s)]
*  The US and Russia did these very same countries to exchanging nuclear weapons [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=258.64s)]
*  and risking nuclear annihilation, including in the Cuban Missile Crisis, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=263.4s)]
*  because the US felt that the Russian presence over the border in Cuba [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  was so threatening that we were going to have a nuclear war over it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=270.92s)]
*  That's how Russia sees what's happening in Ukraine right across their border. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=274.0s)]
*  It is madness to assume that for for Russia, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=278.32s)]
*  what is an existential war, if they actually start losing it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=283.24s)]
*  or NATO really starts escalating as we've been doing, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=286.68s)]
*  that the chances of Vladimir Putin using nuclear weapons is zero. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a dangerous delusion that I think a lot of people are operating under. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  That's totally it's the craziest thing I've ever seen. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  Let me ask you, since you were in Brazil, we spoke to you for our documentary there. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=301.24s)]
*  And at the time we were in Rio and really up until about 20 minutes ago, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  we were told that Bolsonaro was going to get smoked [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  yesterday in the national election. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=311.6s)]
*  That didn't seem to happen. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  What is the state of of of that race right now? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=316.24s)]
*  I've never seen polling data and polling science collapse [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=322.0s)]
*  and be as humiliated as it was in Brazil. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=325.8s)]
*  They didn't just get the presidential race radically wrong, but other races, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=327.8s)]
*  they got wrong by 20 or 30 points always in favor of the Brazilian left [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  and against the Bolsonaro. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=336.68s)]
*  I would say now there's a runoff between Lula, the left wing candidate, and Bolsonaro. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=338.72s)]
*  I would put Lula as the favorite. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=342.72s)]
*  He did come in in first by by four or five points. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  But even if Bolsonaro loses Bolsonaro, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=347.6s)]
*  Ismo, the force that the movement that he created is incredibly powerful. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  The biggest party in the House and the Senate, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  they have governorships of the key states and none of the polling data [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  or the Brazilian media predicted that because they wanted, I think, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=361.68s)]
*  to manipulate the outcome of the election through these fraudulent polling [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=365.28s)]
*  or at the very least, polling that's radically wrong. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=368.88s)]
*  So we'll see what happens on October 30th when the run up when the run up takes place. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=371.08s)]
*  Yeah, not only in Brazil. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  Glenn, I want to hit you with breaking news here. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  So this is approximately both air raid sirens blaring across Tokyo, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=380.44s)]
*  obviously the biggest city in the world, in Japan. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=384.8s)]
*  Government there warning that North Korea has apparently filed [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=387.84s)]
*  fired a ballistic missile into Japanese airspace. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=391.24s)]
*  The Japanese in Tokyo being instructed to shelter indoors immediately. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  Of course, I believe our vice president was just in South Korea. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=399.88s)]
*  Glenn, what what do you make of this? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=404.48s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to analyze the specific event since it just happened, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  but what I will use it for is to again, say that when you start talking about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=412.48s)]
*  things like major countries using long range missiles, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=418.96s)]
*  a lot of times the reason escalation happens isn't even because the countries [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  wanted to, but because when hostilities are intensified enough, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=426.76s)]
*  miscommunication and misperception happen. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=429.92s)]
*  That's why when you get involved in a war like the one in Ukraine, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=432.64s)]
*  things are incredibly dangerous. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=436.4s)]
*  The world is a dangerous place. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=437.84s)]
*  These weapons can kill hundreds of millions of people at once. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=439.28s)]
*  And we are playing with fire, Tucker, by not even being willing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=443.28s)]
*  to debate this out of fear that we're going to be called names. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=447.36s)]
*  And I think it's crucial that we recognize the importance of it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're exactly right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=454.48s)]
*  I mean, it's our job to to say what we think is true, regardless. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=456.76s)]
*  So we're looking at pictures right now of air raid sirens in Tokyo. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=459.68s)]
*  Certainly all of this adds up, at least at first glance, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=463.56s)]
*  to a world in turmoil that is that is in some very deep way resetting, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=467.76s)]
*  you know, those postwar norms and institutions that we often hear [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=472.92s)]
*  the foreign policy people describe seem to be collapsing [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=477.12s)]
*  to some extent around the world. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=480.2s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think it's pretty ironic that for all the accusations [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=484.68s)]
*  about Donald Trump, that he was a Kremlin agent, that he was willing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=488.36s)]
*  to hand over the world to Vladimir Putin. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=491.08s)]
*  It is true that none of these things happened during the Trump administration. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=493.68s)]
*  The Russians annexed Crimea under President Obama. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=497.32s)]
*  They invaded Georgia under President Bush. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=501.08s)]
*  Nothing happened during the Trump years with all of this kind of instability. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=503.68s)]
*  And now we're seeing it again. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=507.24s)]
*  And I think the reason in part is because people look at Joe Biden [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=508.4s)]
*  and know that he's a dottering leader who has clearly lost much, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  if not most of his mental capacity. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  And when you see a leader like that, a lot of countries around the world [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=518.92s)]
*  see that as a signal to start exploiting the situation for their own interest. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  I believe that's absolutely a factor. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=526.12s)]
*  That's totally it's the drunk stepdad. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=528.28s)]
*  Do what you want. No, it's totally it's completely right. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=530.0s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=532.52s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  Great to be with you, Tucker. Thanks. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba4HxCPa-g0&t=537.0s)]
