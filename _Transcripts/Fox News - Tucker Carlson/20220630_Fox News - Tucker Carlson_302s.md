# Tucker Carlson: This hasn't gotten a ton of coverage
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight here in the United States, we've been so deeply engrossed in our own debates over [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=2.7s)]
*  whether men should be allowed to compete on girls swim teams or whether it's immoral to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=6.94s)]
*  carry our groceries in plastic bags that we have missed the fact that the government of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=11.18s)]
*  China has been busy with its own agenda, taking over the world. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=15.34s)]
*  In the space of just 15 years, for example, the Chinese have succeeded in recolonizing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  the entire continent of Africa. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Didn't think that could happen? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=27.66s)]
*  Well, it is happening. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=28.66s)]
*  In Africa, China now calls the shots and takes the natural resources for itself. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=29.94s)]
*  Period. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=34.82s)]
*  As of tonight, there is only one remaining African country that dares to recognize Taiwan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  And it happens to be among the smallest countries in Africa, Swaziland. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=40.92s)]
*  Everyone else on the continent obeys Beijing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=45.92s)]
*  But wait a second. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  How can this be happening? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=50.56s)]
*  Isn't colonialism racist and bad? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=52.82s)]
*  Yes it is. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=55.36s)]
*  And no one's worse and more racist than the Chinese. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=56.52s)]
*  Go on Chinese social media sometime and see how they describe the Africans they've subjugated. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=59.940000000000005s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=64.64s)]
*  So why isn't the New York Times writing stories about any of this? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=66.28s)]
*  You know why. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=70.12s)]
*  Because the New York Times is on China's side. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=71.12s)]
*  That's why they all but ignore the brutal Chinese colonization of Latin America, which [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  is also in full swing right now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=77.58s)]
*  Colonialism violates everything the New York Times once claimed to believe in, but that's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=80.94s)]
*  because they never really believed any of it anyway. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=84.56s)]
*  It was always about power. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=87.44s)]
*  We came to Brazil this week to see for ourselves what the Chinese are doing to Latin America. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=89.76s)]
*  We're making a documentary about it for our Tucker Carlson original series. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=93.86s)]
*  Brazil has the last pro-American government in Latin America. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=97.76s)]
*  It's our single most important ally in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=100.7s)]
*  Allowing Brazil to become a colony of China would be a significant blow to us and potentially [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=104.5s)]
*  a very serious military threat. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration appears to be in favor of it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=111.3s)]
*  One person who's emphatically not in favor of it is the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=114.98s)]
*  So of course the American media hate him. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=121.3s)]
*  Here's some of their slander. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=123.42s)]
*  The United States isn't the only country lurching dangerously towards authoritarianism. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=124.42s)]
*  It is happening all over indeed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=129.48s)]
*  Just yesterday, for example, Brazilians elected Jair Bolsonaro. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=131.68s)]
*  Usually you don't get rid of an aspiring dictator through the electoral process. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=135.34s)]
*  Brazil is going to have trouble with Bolsonaro. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=140.04s)]
*  It's that same authoritarian, like, women-hating, you know, racist energy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=141.82s)]
*  He's the Trump of Brazil. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=150.5s)]
*  President Bolsonaro doesn't believe in social distancing, doesn't want lockdowns. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=151.94s)]
*  Much, much more extreme than President Trump. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=155.7s)]
*  Brazil's far-right nationalist president, Jair Bolsonaro, spoke at an event in Dallas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  These two men and fellow travelers like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin represent the growing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=164.26s)]
*  global threat to the ideas of liberalism. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=168.82s)]
*  These are people whose research consists of three minutes on Wikipedia on the way to the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=173.6s)]
*  studio. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  He's a racist. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  Of course he is. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  He, quote, doesn't want lockdowns. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  There's your proof. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=183.16s)]
*  But it is the last clip from plagiarist Fareed Zakaria that explains why they're so mad at [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  Bolsonaro. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=189.72s)]
*  Bolsonaro, Fareed Zakaria tells us, represents a, quote, growing global threat to the ideas [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=190.72s)]
*  of liberalism. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=196.2s)]
*  Meaning neoliberalism, meaning globalism. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=197.61999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, that is true. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=201.98s)]
*  Bolsonaro is no Justin Trudeau. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=203.48s)]
*  He's not a low IQ fascist who would be working as an Instagram influencer if he doesn't have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=205.32s)]
*  his own army. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=209.48s)]
*  He's not the president of Ukraine who shuts down television stations that dare to criticize [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=210.48s)]
*  him and outlaws opposition parties and arms Nazis. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  In conventional terms, Bolsonaro is in fact liberal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=219.12s)]
*  He has done nothing to stop civil liberties in Brazil. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  But at the same time, he is a nationalist. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=226.56s)]
*  He cares about his country. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=228.4s)]
*  He resists China. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=230.02s)]
*  Therefore he must be stopped. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=231.72s)]
*  George Soros hates him, and so does Joe Biden. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  He's not with the program. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=235.52s)]
*  So naturally we wanted to meet him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday we did. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  We sat with Bolsonaro for more than an hour. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  And the first thing we learned is that the left in Brazil hates him very much. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=243.24s)]
*  They tried to kill him when he first ran for president four years ago. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  With very little money and the backing of no party, he came out of nowhere to get 57 [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=250.46s)]
*  million votes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=254.28s)]
*  But he almost didn't survive to be elected. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=255.32s)]
*  He was stabbed by a leftist almost to death at a rally, at which point the left funded [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  lawyers to come in and rescue his attempted murderer. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=263.96s)]
*  An amazing story that hasn't gotten a ton of coverage in the United States. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=268.96s)]
*  He's an authoritarian, says MSNBC. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=273.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  So we asked Bolsonaro about the stabbing in our conversation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  We also asked him about his Christian faith, which is on display, something else that triggers [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=278.36s)]
*  them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=282.84s)]
*  We asked him about our Supreme Court stance on abortion, his views on gun rights. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=283.84s)]
*  And we asked him fundamentally, why do you think you're so hated? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=288.32s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=292.32s)]
*  changing the world and changing your life. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=297.44s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorZTjwzi5Q&t=299.96s)]
