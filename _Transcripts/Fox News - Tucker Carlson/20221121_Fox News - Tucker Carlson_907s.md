# Tucker Carlson: This should be a crime
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=0.0s)]
*  On Saturday night, as you may now have read, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=2.5s)]
*  a 22 year old man called Anderson Lee Aldrich [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=4.88s)]
*  walked into a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=8.16s)]
*  and opened fire. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=10.68s)]
*  By the time he was subdued by patrons, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=12.16s)]
*  he had murdered five people and injured another 25. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  You've seen this story before, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  but no matter how many times you've seen it, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=19.3s)]
*  it never stops being horrifying and it shouldn't stop. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=21.1s)]
*  Violence and cruelty should always horrify us [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=24.2s)]
*  every single time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=27.04s)]
*  When we start to become cynical about the deaths [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=28.68s)]
*  of other human beings, we have lost something [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=30.68s)]
*  essential to our humanity. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=32.76s)]
*  Unfortunately, you're seeing that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=34.88s)]
*  So the most obvious question is, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=36.96s)]
*  why did Anderson Lee Aldrich shoot 30 people? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=38.2s)]
*  And the truth is we don't know. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=41.08s)]
*  We do know he was clearly a troubled person. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=42.76s)]
*  Last summer, he threatened to blow up [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=45.28s)]
*  his mother's house with a bomb. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Authorities had to evacuate the neighborhood [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=48.44s)]
*  during the four hour standoff that ensued. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=50.28s)]
*  Eventually, he surrendered. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=52.96s)]
*  You're seeing this video first on CNN. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=55.44s)]
*  That shows the alleged gunman, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=58.36s)]
*  22 year old Anderson Lee Aldrich, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=59.96s)]
*  surrendering to law enforcement. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=62.28s)]
*  This is just a year ago, in June of 2021, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=64.36s)]
*  after allegedly making a bomb threat on his own mother. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=67.4s)]
*  So after that happened, he of course was arrested [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=72.96s)]
*  and charged with first degree kidnapping [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=75.92s)]
*  and felony menacing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=78.16s)]
*  But then the local district attorney, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=79.98s)]
*  a man called Michael J. Allen, did not pursue charges. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=81.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=85.78s)]
*  We reached out to Allen's office to find out why, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=86.84s)]
*  but he did not get back to us, so we can only guess. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=90.48s)]
*  We do know what the effect was. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=93.48s)]
*  Because Aldrich was never charged with a crime [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  and his arrest record was sealed, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=97.56s)]
*  his violent past did not show up in background checks. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=99.2s)]
*  Threatening to murder his own mother [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  did not prevent him from buying a firearm, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=103.64s)]
*  even under Colorado's so-called Red Flag Law, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  which was designed to prevent that very thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=108.44s)]
*  So those are the facts. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=111.36s)]
*  That's what we know so far. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  Once again, authorities failed to keep the public safe. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=114.64s)]
*  They didn't do their job. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=118.08s)]
*  You may recognize now a pattern, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=119.8s)]
*  because you have seen that before. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=121.44s)]
*  As for Aldrich's motive in shooting strangers, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=123.54s)]
*  we can only guess, and we're not going to guess, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  both because guessing would be dishonest and irresponsible. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=128.84s)]
*  You can't just make up a story [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=131.6s)]
*  because it suits your preexisting beliefs. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=132.96s)]
*  But more to the point, we're not gonna guess [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=135.24s)]
*  because it would dishonor the memories [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  of the five people who were just murdered [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=138.88s)]
*  in Colorado Springs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=140.6s)]
*  These were human beings. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=142.4s)]
*  They were Americans. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=143.36s)]
*  They were not props in a larger ideological war. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=144.8s)]
*  And to reduce them to that is wrong. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=148.36s)]
*  That's exactly what many politicians are doing right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=150.8s)]
*  Within hours of the shootings, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=154.56s)]
*  Joe Biden and his allies used this tragedy [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=155.88s)]
*  as a pretext for disarming [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=158.0s)]
*  the law-abiding population of the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=159.28s)]
*  We need more gun control, Joe Biden said predictably, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=161.24s)]
*  notwithstanding the fact that Colorado's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=164.32s)]
*  existing gun control laws, which are extensive, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=165.8s)]
*  did not prevent this attack. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  So it was a contemptible and heartless [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=171.22s)]
*  and deeply cynical display of political opportunism. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=173.62s)]
*  But it didn't stop with gun control [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=177.74s)]
*  because in fact, the Second Amendment is not the freedom [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=179.38s)]
*  that threatens the people in charge the most. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=181.66s)]
*  No, that would be the First Amendment, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=184.06s)]
*  which is your right to say what you sincerely believe. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=185.9s)]
*  That is the right, the first in our Bill of Rights [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=189.1s)]
*  that terrifies them the most. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=191.62s)]
*  Your words are a greater threat than any firearm. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=193.82s)]
*  They must censor you or else they lose power. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=197.92s)]
*  It is that simple. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=200.58s)]
*  So these horrifying murders in Colorado over the weekend [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=202.34s)]
*  quickly became a pretext for yet more censorship [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  of your speech. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  You are responsible for this, they told you, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=210.02s)]
*  because you said the wrong things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=212.56s)]
*  You are guilty of stochastic terrorism, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=214.54000000000002s)]
*  inspiring violence by your beliefs. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=217.34s)]
*  Anderson Lee Aldrich committed mass murder [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=220.18s)]
*  because you complained about the sexualizing of children. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=222.28s)]
*  Every time you object to drag time story hour [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  for fifth graders or point out that genital mutilation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=228.94s)]
*  is being committed on minors, which it is, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=231.82s)]
*  every time you say that, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=233.98s)]
*  you are putting people's lives at risk. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=235.1s)]
*  Now that seems implausible [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=239.14s)]
*  and yet many are making this claim. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=240.46s)]
*  Many have made it over the past 24 hours. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=242.18s)]
*  Watch for example, Brandy Zdrosny of NBC. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=244.7s)]
*  Online, including this Libs of TikTok account, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=248.82s)]
*  which feeds larger media like Fox News stories. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=251.22s)]
*  What has happened is a demonization of LGBTQ people, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=255.54s)]
*  calling them groomers and pedophiles. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=259.98s)]
*  This type of thing, whether we can say it's motive or not, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=262.92s)]
*  what we know is that it's just another reason [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=265.98s)]
*  why LGBTQ people are scared. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=268.82s)]
*  So there it is, right there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=273.09999999999997s)]
*  When you point out the truth indisputably, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=274.86s)]
*  and the truth is that some adults in this country, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  apparently a growing number, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=279.9s)]
*  have a deeply unhealthy fixation [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=281.34s)]
*  on the sexuality of children, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=283.4s)]
*  when you say that out loud, you get people killed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=285.18s)]
*  That is what Brandy Zdrosny is saying. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=289.26s)]
*  And by saying that, Brandy Zdrosny, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=292.66s)]
*  and the many people like her, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=294.7s)]
*  are effectively defending that same [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=296.3s)]
*  deeply unhealthy fixation on the sexuality of children. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=298.66s)]
*  By the way, it's absolutely real. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=301.9s)]
*  You're not imagining that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=303.86s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=305.38s)]
*  The evidence is everywhere [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=306.9s)]
*  and it comes to light on the internet. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=308.48s)]
*  And Brandy Zdrosny and people like her [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=310.22s)]
*  hate that you are seeing that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=312.14s)]
*  Notice that Zdrosny is not claiming [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=313.82s)]
*  that Libs of TikTok is making this up. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=316.78s)]
*  She never even suggests that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=319.74s)]
*  She is threatening them, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=321.34s)]
*  and what she's doing is threatening them, you should know. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=322.42s)]
*  And she's doing that because they're pointing it out. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  Noticing it's happening is their crime. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=327.82s)]
*  And once again, it is happening. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=330.86s)]
*  Children's Hospital in Boston, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=334.1s)]
*  one of the most famous hospitals in the world, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=335.8s)]
*  has admitted performing double mastectomies on children [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=337.7s)]
*  for no medical reason at all. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=341.14s)]
*  There is no scientific justification [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=344.06s)]
*  for sexually mutilating kids. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=346.26s)]
*  They are not doing it [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=348.74s)]
*  for a scientifically defensible reason. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=350.06s)]
*  They are doing it because they believe [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=351.85999999999996s)]
*  in a very specific religious ideology. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=356.85999999999996s)]
*  Is pointing that out an attack on gay people? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=358.32s)]
*  Of course it is not an attack on gay people. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  It has nothing to do with gay people. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=364.29999999999995s)]
*  It has to do with sexually mutilating children, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=367.34s)]
*  which is wrong, period. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=370.3s)]
*  It should be a crime, period. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=373.5s)]
*  And yet suddenly it's very common. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  As we've reported on this show, UCSF, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  University of California San Francisco Hospital, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=381.3s)]
*  one of the leading hospitals in the world, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=383.0s)]
*  is doing this as well. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=384.7s)]
*  And they've said so out loud. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=385.98s)]
*  This is an actual quote from their website. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=387.86s)]
*  Genital surgery is being performed on a case-by-case basis [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=390.18s)]
*  more frequently in minors. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=393.66s)]
*  In the absence of solid evidence, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=395.78000000000003s)]
*  providers often must rely on the expert opinions [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=398.38s)]
*  of innovators and thought leaders in the field. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=401.12s)]
*  So your child gets sexually mutilated genital surgery [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=404.86s)]
*  that is irreversible, not on the basis of science, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=409.86s)]
*  but on the basis of innovators and thought leaders. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=413.1s)]
*  It's hard to believe that's happening. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=417.38s)]
*  That quote was scrubbed, by the way, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=419.34s)]
*  after we reported on it, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=420.86s)]
*  not because it wasn't a real quote, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=421.98s)]
*  but because it was a real quote. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=424.5s)]
*  It was too incriminating. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=426.32s)]
*  Once again, this is everywhere. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  A parent in Pennsylvania called Megan Brock [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=431.24s)]
*  decided to do some actual reporting on it [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  because actual reporters choose not to. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=434.84s)]
*  They look away and attack anyone [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=436.74s)]
*  who wants to know what's actually happening. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  So she filed a records request. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=440.86s)]
*  And this week she obtained a 2017 email [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  from Dr. Nadia Dautian [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=445.21999999999997s)]
*  at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=447.4s)]
*  Again, one of the most famous hospitals in the world, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=449.08s)]
*  known as CHOP, a widely beloved institution [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  that has helped very many. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=453.46s)]
*  But in this case, what they were doing shocks the senses. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=455.28s)]
*  In a communication with now HHS Secretary Rachel Levine, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  she wrote this, quote, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=464.2s)]
*  "'I'm not aware of existing literature.'" [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=465.52s)]
*  This is Dautian. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=468.02s)]
*  "'But certainly it is happening. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=468.94s)]
*  I think we've had more than 10 patients [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  who have had chest surgery under 18, as young as 15, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=472.76s)]
*  and bottom surgery 17.'" [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=476.08s)]
*  That's the sexual mutilation of children [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  for no medical or scientific reason, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=483.38s)]
*  simply because right now it is fashionable [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=486.88s)]
*  and consistent with a cult that has taken over [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=489.36s)]
*  a lot of the leadership of this country. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=492.52s)]
*  But the fact remains children are being destroyed by this. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=494.56s)]
*  It should be a crime. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=498.54s)]
*  The people who commit it should be in jail. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=499.62s)]
*  But it's not just the sexual mutilation [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=502.78s)]
*  of children in hospitals. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=504.5s)]
*  This is part of a larger trend. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=505.98s)]
*  And the trend is this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=507.7s)]
*  Adults crossing the line, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=508.96s)]
*  and it has always been a bright line, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=510.84s)]
*  into deep involvement with the sexuality of children. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=512.54s)]
*  That has always been, and must in a civilized society, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=516.56s)]
*  always be, the most forbidden thing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=519.3399999999999s)]
*  It's considered unacceptable even among prison inmates. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=521.86s)]
*  But now it seems to be growing in its prevalence. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=525.5s)]
*  Consider the latest ad for the clothing brand Balenciaga. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=529.74s)]
*  This was just uploaded on Instagram. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=533.5s)]
*  As you can see, the photo shoot they're using [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=535.4599999999999s)]
*  to sell their products features a young girl [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=537.74s)]
*  holding a teddy bear in a bondage outfit. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=539.66s)]
*  Then in case you missed the point, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=543.2199999999999s)]
*  the photo shoot also contains this image. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=544.78s)]
*  It shows several documents. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=546.74s)]
*  Most of them aren't visible, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=548.3s)]
*  but what you can see when you zoom in, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=549.3399999999999s)]
*  and of course the point is that you see it, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=550.98s)]
*  is a reference to a US Supreme Court case [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=552.98s)]
*  called Ashcroft versus Free Speech Coalition. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=555.24s)]
*  That case struck down a law against kiddie porn. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=558.1s)]
*  What is this? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=562.98s)]
*  Well, it is what it appears to be. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=564.12s)]
*  It's an endorsement of kiddie porn, of child pornography. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=566.22s)]
*  What else could it be? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  We wanted to know. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=571.14s)]
*  So we reached out today to Balenciaga [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=572.3000000000001s)]
*  to get their explanation, and they didn't respond. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=573.94s)]
*  So we're gonna have to take that on face value and ask, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=576.74s)]
*  where's the moral outrage? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=580.58s)]
*  We have an entire industry in this country [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=582.32s)]
*  comprised of moral outrage merchants. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=585.58s)]
*  If you've ever been on Twitter, you know what we mean. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=588.6600000000001s)]
*  Truly, an entire sector of our economy [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=591.46s)]
*  is devoted to attacking people [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=594.02s)]
*  for falling short of the mark. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=596.02s)]
*  And here is a high-end retailer promoting kiddie porn [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=598.02s)]
*  in an ad on Instagram, and nobody notices. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=601.4s)]
*  There's no boycott, there's no front page [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=604.3s)]
*  New York Times editorial against it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=605.96s)]
*  And of course, Instagram let the advertisement run, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=608.54s)]
*  endorsing kiddie porn. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=610.98s)]
*  And by the way, if you have an alternate explanation [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=611.9s)]
*  for what this was, let us know. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=613.48s)]
*  A child with a teddy bear in a bondage outfit [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=614.98s)]
*  and a Supreme Court decision striking down a kiddie porn law [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  displayed on the table, what is that? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=621.12s)]
*  Are we jumping to conclusions? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=622.98s)]
*  Don't think so. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=624.32s)]
*  It is what it appears to be. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=625.44s)]
*  It's right in your face and no one's saying anything. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=627.02s)]
*  Again, Instagram had no problem with this. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=630.96s)]
*  Until Elon Musk took over Twitter, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=633.74s)]
*  Twitter allowed hashtags that explicitly linked [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=635.78s)]
*  to child pornography. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=638.38s)]
*  Nobody said anything because crimes against children [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=640.2s)]
*  are no big deal. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=642.38s)]
*  It's thought crimes that are the real crimes. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=643.32s)]
*  So if you said something about it, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=646.0600000000001s)]
*  if you were Libs of TikTok and said, wait a second, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=647.44s)]
*  this seems to be abetting child molestation, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=649.58s)]
*  which of course, that's what it's doing, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=651.38s)]
*  you were instantly booted off Twitter. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=654.5s)]
*  But the links to kiddie porn, they're still there. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=657.38s)]
*  Well, now they've been deleted. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=659.22s)]
*  Thank God, that's one improvement. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=660.56s)]
*  So all of this has been happening out in the open, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=662.62s)]
*  but NBC News hasn't bothered to report on any of it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=665.5s)]
*  Where is their report tonight? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=667.86s)]
*  A Balenciaga pushing kiddie porn in an Instagram ad? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=668.82s)]
*  No, they're reserving all their energy [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=671.5s)]
*  to attack you for noticing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=674.32s)]
*  You're a stochastic terrorist, if you point it out. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=676.04s)]
*  You need to be censored, watch. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=678.7s)]
*  Content moderation is a hard task. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=682.3000000000001s)]
*  What we know is that Twitter and where the bulk [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=685.26s)]
*  of this information is right now, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=688.46s)]
*  because that's where the biggest accounts like Matt Walsh [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=690.0600000000001s)]
*  and Libs of TikTok again, where they sort of post this stuff. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=693.82s)]
*  What's being done? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=698.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, two days ago, we know that Elon Musk, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=699.4200000000001s)]
*  who owns Twitter now, he just reversed the policy [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=702.94s)]
*  that Twitter did have against targeting and harassment [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=706.14s)]
*  of LGBTQ people against misgendering transgender people. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=709.26s)]
*  So here you have people mutilating the genitals [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=714.46s)]
*  of children, running ads on Instagram, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=717.62s)]
*  promoting kiddie porn, and there's Brandy Zdrosny [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=719.8199999999999s)]
*  on NBC News, she's not attacking them. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=723.98s)]
*  She's attacking anyone who notices [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=727.9s)]
*  and accusing them of attacking gay people. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=730.1s)]
*  Once again, this has nothing to do with gay people. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=732.84s)]
*  This is an attack on the sexual fixation on [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=735.98s)]
*  and mutilation of the genitals of children, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=739.14s)]
*  pushing kiddie porn. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=742.14s)]
*  It has nothing to do with gay people. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=744.02s)]
*  That's an offense against anyone's definition of decency [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=745.42s)]
*  and she's effectively defending it, and they all are. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=748.42s)]
*  You're not allowed to notice it, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=751.66s)]
*  or else you're committing violence. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=752.9s)]
*  You're complicit in mass murder. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=754.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, the people who are doing these things are fine. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=757.74s)]
*  No one attacks them. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=760.9399999999999s)]
*  An ACLU spokesman launched this attack on Doug Lamborn, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=762.22s)]
*  a congressman from Colorado, watch this. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=765.54s)]
*  He voted against the Respect for Marriage Act [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=768.02s)]
*  and is a co-sponsor of Marjorie Taylor Greene's [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=770.74s)]
*  nationwide ban on gender affirming care for trans youth. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=772.74s)]
*  Huh? That's the crime? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=776.9399999999999s)]
*  Children having their genitals mutilated [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=779.5799999999999s)]
*  on the basis of no science, no actual real medical guidance, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=781.46s)]
*  no longitudinal study, there's no evidence [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=784.72s)]
*  this is a good idea, but GLAAD is for it [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=787.16s)]
*  so doctors mindlessly do it, and you can't complain [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=789.38s)]
*  or else you're a murderer? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=792.42s)]
*  Too crazy, these are our children, can't put up with it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=794.6999999999999s)]
*  For her part, GLAAD's president declared [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=797.3s)]
*  that because of Saturday's shooting, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=799.0999999999999s)]
*  you need to shut up while doctors mutilate children. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=800.42s)]
*  In terms of trans kids and gender affirming care, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=804.4599999999999s)]
*  the American Medical Association, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=808.42s)]
*  the Pediatric Association has confirmed [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=810.9799999999999s)]
*  that these are safe procedures. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=813.6999999999999s)]
*  This is finished business. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=815.88s)]
*  It's politicians and junk science [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=817.9399999999999s)]
*  who's creating some kind of debate or argument about this. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=820.8199999999999s)]
*  Really? Now we realize she's paid to say that. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=825.6600000000001s)]
*  Of course, all these activists are paid [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=828.5400000000001s)]
*  to say what they say, very specifically paid. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=830.2600000000001s)]
*  ACLU's paid to say what they say. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=832.7s)]
*  They all are. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=835.5200000000001s)]
*  ADL's paid to say what it says. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=836.36s)]
*  GLAAD is paid to say what it says. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=838.86s)]
*  But the truth is, the no BS scientific truth is [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=841.3000000000001s)]
*  there's no evidence it's safe. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=844.82s)]
*  Where's the 10 year study on that? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=846.62s)]
*  Do you have one? Oh, you don't have one. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=847.7600000000001s)]
*  We have no idea what the longterm effects [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=849.1s)]
*  of puberty blockers are. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=851.3000000000001s)]
*  We have no idea. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=853.02s)]
*  We can't even guess as the longterm psychological effects [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=854.0s)]
*  of genital mutilation on a 17 year old or 15 year old. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=857.62s)]
*  What? You have no idea it's safe. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=860.78s)]
*  You're lying. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=862.42s)]
*  It's not a safe procedure. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=864.06s)]
*  We've spoken to a lot of victims of this barbarism [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=866.28s)]
*  and it is barbarism. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=868.5799999999999s)]
*  We did a whole documentary on it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=869.66s)]
*  And by the end of the documentary, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=871.22s)]
*  we were more shocked than when we started reporting it out. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=873.06s)]
*  Even people who support these procedures [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=875.98s)]
*  can't actually defend them. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=878.38s)]
*  And that's the whole point. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=880.14s)]
*  They have to make you shut up [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  because they don't have any facts on their side. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=882.56s)]
*  If you're not okay with child abuse, you're a murderer. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=884.72s)]
*  And it's worked on a lot of weak minded journalists [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=887.36s)]
*  who only care about status and acceptance by the group, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=889.66s)]
*  but there are a few on whom it has not worked. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=893.24s)]
*  At the top of that list is Chris Ruffo. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4wx8lNBdzU&t=895.16s)]
