# Tucker Carlson: This may be a national security threat
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc)
*  You remember back to August and the atrocities the media told us about, not in Mexico or Brazil, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=0.0s)]
*  certainly not in Ukraine, but at Mar-a-Lago, remember that? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=6.8s)]
*  Classified documents were discovered, illicit classified documents, including top secret cocktail napkins. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=10.0s)]
*  At Mar-a-Lago, there was even, and we're quoting the federal indictment, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=16.2s)]
*  a birthday dinner menu found somewhere near the First Lady's closet. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=19.2s)]
*  Now, the Washington Post first reported that nuclear codes or relevant nuclear material, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=22.8s)]
*  secret ones were discovered there, and that's why a former CIA director and Michael Beschloss, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=28.0s)]
*  the historian, suggested it could be time for Donald Trump to be executed by electric chair. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=32.0s)]
*  And for sure, and this was the consensus in Washington, once these documents were discovered, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=37.8s)]
*  this crime was unearthed. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=42.6s)]
*  There was no possibility Donald Trump could ever again run for office. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=45.6s)]
*  He needed to go to jail. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=48.6s)]
*  Every person connected to the Biden administration told us that, including Joe Biden himself. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=50.6s)]
*  What data was in there that may compromise sources and methods, Biden asked. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=55.5s)]
*  So as Biden was saying that, it turns out that he was, and you'll be shocked to hear this, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=61.5s)]
*  doing exactly the same thing that he accused Donald Trump of doing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=65.5s)]
*  Joe Biden was storing classified documents in a private office at a fake think tank [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=69.5s)]
*  that has been set up for him at the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=73.5s)]
*  That fake think tank is called the Penn-Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=76.5s)]
*  at the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=82.5s)]
*  Now we should tell you, we don't know exactly what these classified documents are, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=84.5s)]
*  and unlike Michael Beschloss and the former head of the CIA, we're not going to speculate. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=87.5s)]
*  But according to CNN, they were very sensitive. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=91.5s)]
*  The classified materials included some top secret files with a sensitive compartmented information designation, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=94.5s)]
*  also known as SCI, which is used for highly sensitive information obtained from intelligence sources. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=100.5s)]
*  So what exactly were these materials? Were they the nuclear codes? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=106.5s)]
*  We're probably going to find out pretty soon because there's no question Merrick Garland [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=109.5s)]
*  will unleash one of his signature pre-dawn raids on the University of Pennsylvania at any moment. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=113.5s)]
*  Because it's a national security threat. Merrick Garland will get right on that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=121.5s)]
*  But actually, Penn may be a national security event. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=125.5s)]
*  We know you're very impressed your nephew got in, but Penn, as an institution, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=128.5s)]
*  takes an awful lot of money from the Chinese Communist Party. Not making that up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=133.5s)]
*  In recent years, Penn has received more than $50 million from anonymous Chinese donors. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=137.5s)]
*  So the question is, were those donors peering at the classified documents, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=143.5s)]
*  the national security secrets that Joe Biden had been stashing at the fake think tank that Penn set up for him? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=147.5s)]
*  How much access do they have exactly to these documents? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=153.5s)]
*  We're very much looking forward to the Washington Post expose on that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=156.5s)]
*  We're going to be watching you. We're going to be watching you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vGOd1ir7zc&t=167.5s)]
