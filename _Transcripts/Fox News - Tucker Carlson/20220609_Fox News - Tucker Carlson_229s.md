# The left has no agenda for November midterms: Victor Davis Hanson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ)
*  Victor Davis Hansen is a historian, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=1.8s)]
*  and one of our favorite guests. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=3.48s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=4.48s)]
*  What conclusions do you draw from this spectacle? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=6.44s)]
*  Well, I think that usually in normal times, Tucker, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=10.88s)]
*  that we don't do insane things, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=13.72s)]
*  like let people out with no bail [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  or do not prosecute people who are arrested [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=17.88s)]
*  or let felons out of prison. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=20.62s)]
*  But these are confined to the campus, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=22.14s)]
*  critical race theory, critical legal theory, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=24.12s)]
*  critical penal theory. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=26.66s)]
*  But I don't know whether it was COVID [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=27.76s)]
*  or the lockdown or George Floyd [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=29.4s)]
*  or the 120 days of rioting in summer of 2020 [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  or the strange 102 mail-in ballots [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  or the Biden left-wing agenda. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=38.32s)]
*  But these academic theories got mainstream [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=39.96s)]
*  into actual policies of defunding the police [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=42.9s)]
*  and letting criminals out of jail and et cetera. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=45.32s)]
*  We lost deterrence. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=47.92s)]
*  So the criminal today says in a cost-benefit analysis, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  it's in my interest to commit a crime [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=52.84s)]
*  because I'm not going to pay the price for it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=55.64s)]
*  And then we can't deal with that reality. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=58.24s)]
*  But if you're talking about white supremacy, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  we would like to go to certain data areas to confirm that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=63.36s)]
*  So when we look at rare interracial crimes, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=66.76s)]
*  which are pretty rare, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=68.88s)]
*  African-Americans by a great number [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=70.36s)]
*  are disproportionately commit them [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=72.4s)]
*  against whites versus blacks. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=73.76s)]
*  That wouldn't be possible under a white supremacist nation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=76.92s)]
*  Or if you look at murders and violent assaults, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=79.7s)]
*  African-Americans in cases of murders are between 50% and 60%, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=82.30000000000001s)]
*  even though they only make up 12% of the population. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=86.44s)]
*  And whites are underrepresented. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=90.96s)]
*  If you look at hate crimes, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=92.48s)]
*  African-Americans are overrepresented [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=94.72s)]
*  and whites are underrepresented. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=96.84s)]
*  I'm not trying to justify any of this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm just giving you the data. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=100.74s)]
*  But that data is toxic to these theories. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=102.12s)]
*  So people try to suppress it or they massage it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=105.32s)]
*  or they contextualize it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  But we're never gonna get to helping the people [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=108.9s)]
*  who really need the help in the inner city, the innocents, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=111.2s)]
*  if we don't stop this crime wave. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=114.2s)]
*  And a lot of it has to do with African-American males [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=116.72s)]
*  who feel one way or another there's no deterrent left. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=118.64s)]
*  And as far as the white supremacy, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=122.4s)]
*  we recall, remember Lloyd Austin and Mark Milley [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  gave us lecture after lecture about it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=127.56s)]
*  And so we, but one thing they didn't do, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=129.56s)]
*  they never gave us any data. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=131.68s)]
*  They didn't say, here's the Pentagon's data. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=133.04s)]
*  Here's the enlisted ranks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=135.88s)]
*  We have an epidemic where white soldiers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=137.56s)]
*  are committing interracial acts of hostility [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=139.52s)]
*  at a greater number than Hispanics or Latinos [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=143.04s)]
*  vis-a-vis other race. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=146.32s)]
*  They never told us that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=147.16s)]
*  But since they wanted to dwell on race, race, race [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=148.28s)]
*  and proportional representation, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=151.74s)]
*  which I think is very dangerous in a multiracial society, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=153.08s)]
*  maybe whites are more violent in the sense [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=156.84s)]
*  that they're more likely to be in combat units [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=159.28s)]
*  by double their numbers of the general population. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=162.56s)]
*  And white males died at twice their numbers [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=165.0s)]
*  in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=167.34s)]
*  Nobody ever talks about that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  If that's what they mean by they took a gun [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  and they went after the enemy and that makes them dangerous, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=172.32s)]
*  I don't know if that's what they intended. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=174.44s)]
*  But finally, Tucker, they don't, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=177.16s)]
*  the left doesn't have an agenda in November. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=180.32s)]
*  So we're gonna hear Roe versus Wade. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=183.0s)]
*  We're gonna hear the Electoral College is racist, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  filibusters. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  We're gonna hear white supremacy, white supremacy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=189.2s)]
*  And we're never going to hear, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=191.72s)]
*  here's what we can do for energy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=193.32s)]
*  Here's what we can do for deterrence of foreign policy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=195.28s)]
*  Here's what we can do for inflation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=197.56s)]
*  None of that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=198.92s)]
*  So this is what it's all about. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=199.96s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=202.6s)]
*  If you improve people's lives, no matter what color they are, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=203.44s)]
*  they'll vote for you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=205.88s)]
*  And if you don't, they won't. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=206.72s)]
*  I don't know why they haven't figured that out. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=207.72s)]
*  They won't. But they haven't. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=209.4s)]
*  Victor Davis Hanson, great to see you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=210.4s)]
*  We don't wanna go back to a tribal racial society. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=211.24s)]
*  We wanna be content of our character, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=213.68s)]
*  not the color of our skin. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=215.92s)]
*  Amen. Thank you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gREKQ_ObpQ&t=217.36s)]
