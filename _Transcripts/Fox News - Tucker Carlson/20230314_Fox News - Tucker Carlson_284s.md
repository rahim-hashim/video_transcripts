# Tucker: Diversity director allegedly removed for questioning anti-racist policies
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY)
*  Last night we showed you a pretty shocking video actually [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=0.0s)]
*  from within Stanford Law School. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  And it showed someone who identified as a quote, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=4.76s)]
*  diversity dean lecturing a sitting federal judge [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=7.0s)]
*  who's a serious person on the quote, harms that he caused. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=10.96s)]
*  And that video got us thinking about the state of colleges [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=14.64s)]
*  and universities in this country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=17.44s)]
*  Why are there so many diversity deans? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  And why are they like this? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=21.64s)]
*  Tabia Lee is a former diversity director at De Anza College. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=24.36s)]
*  She was removed from her role for questioning [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=27.4s)]
*  the school's anti-racist policies. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=30.32s)]
*  And she joins us now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=32.36s)]
*  Ms. Lee, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=33.28s)]
*  So tell us your story if you would, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  because it's a little shocking honestly, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=38.68s)]
*  but I think it tells us a lot [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=41.28s)]
*  about the state of higher education. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=46.68s)]
*  I was hired on at De Anza College in 2021 [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=48.04s)]
*  as a faculty director of an office of equity, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=52.68s)]
*  social justice and multicultural education. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=56.08s)]
*  And this was my lifelong dream [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=59.12s)]
*  of a tenure track faculty leadership position. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=60.72s)]
*  And I thought that I would be afforded, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=63.92s)]
*  the academic freedom and freedom of expression [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=66.6s)]
*  that's available to any faculty member. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=68.84s)]
*  And what I discovered was that as I started to, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=71.16s)]
*  enact my teaching approach, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=75.4s)]
*  which I was very transparent about when I was hired on, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=78.28s)]
*  what I seek to do is bring together people of diverse [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=81.8s)]
*  and divergent perspectives, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=85.12s)]
*  and to identify points of commonality between those [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=87.0s)]
*  so that we can best serve our students. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=90.28s)]
*  As I began to do that work, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=92.6s)]
*  there was a severe backlash [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=94.0s)]
*  from some of the extremists on the campus [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=96.28s)]
*  who identify themselves as woke [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=98.6s)]
*  and as aligned with critical social justice ideology. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=101.2s)]
*  And they attacked me viciously. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=105.44s)]
*  They subverted my tenure review process to do so. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=108.08s)]
*  And it saddens me as someone who benefited [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=111.48s)]
*  from California community colleges, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=114.28s)]
*  as foundational to my scholarship and to who I am today, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=116.44s)]
*  to see the state that we're in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  and to see the tenure review process misused and abused [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=122.72s)]
*  by individuals for reasons of not wanting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=127.08s)]
*  to have multiple perspectives and viewpoint diversity [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=130.32s)]
*  and critical thinking, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=133.72s)]
*  which is part of the mission [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=135.12s)]
*  of California community colleges. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  I can't think of anything more virtuous [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=138.84s)]
*  than bringing people with different beliefs together [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=140.72s)]
*  to find something that they have in common. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=142.72s)]
*  I mean, it's what the country really needs, of course. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=144.12s)]
*  But I have the feeling that the divergent viewpoints part [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=146.08s)]
*  of your mission was the offensive part. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=149.16s)]
*  Yes, unfortunately, as I did my needs assessment [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=153.36s)]
*  conversations, multiple people did tell me [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=157.76s)]
*  that there was some issues with viewpoint diversity [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=160.76s)]
*  and certain groups, small groups, but vocal groups of people [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=164.68s)]
*  being really reticent to engage with a divergent [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  or diverse perspectives. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=174.36s)]
*  And as I began to do my work, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=175.72s)]
*  these individuals were seated on my tenure review committee [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=178.12s)]
*  and they began to attack my work for doing exactly that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm someone who I talk about teacher ideology and practice. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  And what I'm really trying to do through that work [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=191.32s)]
*  is get teachers to become more conscious [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=194.0s)]
*  about the ideologies that they express, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=196.76s)]
*  embody and enact in their teaching. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=199.16s)]
*  And that is something that I do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=202.28s)]
*  I don't work from a singular ideological perspective [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=205.04s)]
*  or even promote any particular ideological perspective. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=208.16s)]
*  What I'm doing is bringing in adult learners [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=212.44s)]
*  diverse opinions and viewpoints [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=214.84s)]
*  and also letting them know there's many ways to do this work, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=216.72s)]
*  not just one, and for not toeing the line [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=220.64s)]
*  of absolute fidelity to a critical social justice ideology. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  I was made a pariah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=228.48s)]
*  My work was undermined. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=231.48s)]
*  My leadership was undermined by key senior leaders [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=233.2s)]
*  and faculty members there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=236.32s)]
*  And they literally obstructed me from doing my work [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  and I was subjected to censorship and profanity [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=241.92s)]
*  in the tenure review process. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  And it was just something that was really hard to see [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=247.84s)]
*  because as educators, there's a certain level [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=251.44s)]
*  of professionalism and civil discourse [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=255.04s)]
*  that we should engage everyone with, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=257.44s)]
*  whether they're different from us or not. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=259.04s)]
*  I hope you sue them into the Stone Age. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=261.92s)]
*  And it's so nice of you to come on [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  and tell your story tonight, which is a scary story, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=265.12s)]
*  but we appreciate it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujWWNoVfNY&t=267.36s)]
