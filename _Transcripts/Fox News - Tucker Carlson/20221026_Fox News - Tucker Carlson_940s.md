# Tucker Carlson: This was humiliating for Fetterman
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's Night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=0.0s)]
*  Good night everybody. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=3.2s)]
*  Two days before the Democratic Senate primary [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=4.9s)]
*  in Pennsylvania back in May, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=7.0s)]
*  staffers for the John Fetterman campaign [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=8.6s)]
*  announced that their candidate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=10.46s)]
*  had tragically suffered a stroke, but no problem. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=11.72s)]
*  In a written statement, purportedly written [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=15.34s)]
*  by John Fetterman himself from the hospital, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=17.3s)]
*  Fetterman announced that he was absolutely fine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=19.7s)]
*  "'I'm feeling much better,' the statement read. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=22.1s)]
*  "'Doctors tell me I didn't suffer any cognitive damage.'" [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=24.36s)]
*  Okay, so the primary continued as planned [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=28.58s)]
*  with Fetterman's name on the ballot, and Fetterman won. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=30.54s)]
*  He became the Democratic nominee. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=33.26s)]
*  And that was the last that most voters heard [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=35.26s)]
*  about John Fetterman's stroke. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=37.5s)]
*  For months, Fetterman remained in semi-seclusion. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=39.7s)]
*  Then as the campaign progressed and the polls tightened, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=43.18s)]
*  he began to venture out, he had no choice. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=45.54s)]
*  And video clips surfaced of Fetterman speaking at rallies [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  in what seemed to be a bizarre and highly disjointed way. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=51.42s)]
*  Some began to wonder if he'd really suffered, quote, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=55.18s)]
*  no cognitive damage from his stroke. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=57.58s)]
*  It was at this point that Fetterman's personal physician, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=60.78s)]
*  a man called Clifford Chen, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=63.94s)]
*  who also happened to be a campaign donor [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=65.34s)]
*  to him and other Democrats, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=67.3s)]
*  rushed forward to bring science to bear on this question. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=68.74s)]
*  In Clifford Chen's considered opinion [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=72.74s)]
*  as a respected medical professional [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=74.86s)]
*  who works at a major research university, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=76.78s)]
*  John Fetterman was absolutely fine. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=79.18s)]
*  Fetterman was, quote, recovering well from his stroke. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=82.58s)]
*  He had, quote, no work restrictions [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=85.7s)]
*  and can work full duty in public office. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=87.97999999999999s)]
*  In other words, John Fetterman was as sharp [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=91.74s)]
*  and as healthy as you or me as anyone in America, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=94.1s)]
*  in fact, more so, ready for the Senate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=96.94s)]
*  Fetterman's wife, who presumably would know, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=100.38s)]
*  seconded this assessment and attacked anyone who disagreed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=102.74s)]
*  So did a group of Democratic office holders [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=107.22s)]
*  who wrote a piece in the Huffington Post [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=109.3s)]
*  about how their own strokes [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  had only enhanced their public service. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=112.46s)]
*  A stroke? No big deal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=114.78s)]
*  It's a good thing, actually. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  Ought to be a prerequisite for service in the Senate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=118.14s)]
*  For their part, most of the reporters [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=122.1s)]
*  who covered John Fetterman day to day [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=123.58s)]
*  worked hard to calm concerns about his health. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=125.42s)]
*  Is John Fetterman a silver-tongued wordsmith? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=128.66s)]
*  No, they conceded. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=131.76s)]
*  He never has been. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=133.8s)]
*  But brain damage? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=135.14s)]
*  Come on, don't be a bigot. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  That's ableist. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=138.72s)]
*  Until last night, that's pretty much where things stood. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=140.94s)]
*  Some people, mostly Republicans, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=143.82s)]
*  thought John Fetterman might not be mentally fit [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=145.62s)]
*  to work in the Senate. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=148.26s)]
*  Others, mostly Democrats, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=149.62s)]
*  agreed with Clifford Chen, his doctor, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=151.26s)]
*  that Fetterman was absolutely fine. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=153.56s)]
*  So was a neat partisan split. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Then, Fetterman appeared on stage [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  for his first and only debate [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=160.98s)]
*  and settled this question for all time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=162.7s)]
*  John Fetterman, it turns out, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=165.38s)]
*  is not capable of driving a car. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=166.62s)]
*  He should not be allowed to operate a microwave oven. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=168.82s)]
*  There is no chance that under any imaginable circumstances, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=171.5s)]
*  John Fetterman could, quote, serve in the U.S. Senate. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=174.5s)]
*  It's not a close call. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=177.7s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=178.98s)]
*  You're running for a seat that could decide [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=180.7s)]
*  the balance of power in Washington. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=183.26s)]
*  What qualifies you to be a U.S. Senator? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=185.58s)]
*  You have 60 seconds. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=188.66s)]
*  Hi. Good night, everybody. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=191.18s)]
*  What? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=195.66s)]
*  So that was the moment, right at the top, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=197.14s)]
*  that you know this was not a debate [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=198.9s)]
*  like the debates you'd seen before. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=201.18s)]
*  Most debates feel pretty scripted. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=203.66s)]
*  In fact, this debate actually was scripted. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=205.74s)]
*  John Fetterman had a script. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=208.22s)]
*  He was reading it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=210.34s)]
*  But he was still incapable of following that script. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=211.94s)]
*  Here, for example, is how Fetterman responded [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=216.38s)]
*  to maybe the most obvious question of the night, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  one he knew was coming [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=220.06s)]
*  and, of course, would have prepared for. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=221.86s)]
*  Here's his answer. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=223.34s)]
*  You're saying tonight that you support fracking, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=225.3s)]
*  that you've always supported fracking, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  but there is that 2018 interview that you said, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=230.26s)]
*  I don't support fracking at all. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=233.54s)]
*  So how do you square the two? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=235.26s)]
*  I do support fracking, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=241.22s)]
*  and I don't, I don't, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=243.89999999999998s)]
*  I support fracking, and I stand, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=248.5s)]
*  and I do support fracking. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=250.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=253.66s)]
*  So a lot of conclusions here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=254.73999999999998s)]
*  The most obvious, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=256.62s)]
*  why is Clifford Chen still practicing medicine? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=258.22s)]
*  If you're a physician, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=261.58s)]
*  are you allowed to lie for partisan reasons? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=263.06s)]
*  Don't we have enough of that in this country? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=265.38s)]
*  Should doctors be allowed to do that? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=266.9s)]
*  He clearly was lying. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=268.7s)]
*  That's not a man who can work with no restrictions [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=270.26s)]
*  in the US Senate. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  Far from it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=274.14s)]
*  And everyone watching, every honest person, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=275.58s)]
*  would come to that conclusion. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=279.94s)]
*  We could play you a lot of clips like that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=281.14s)]
*  You've probably seen them already today. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=283.58s)]
*  But not everyone is an honest person. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=286.26s)]
*  And to prove it, we're gonna show you how MSNBC [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=288.38s)]
*  covered this debate the moment it ended. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=290.82s)]
*  Here is New York Magazine's Rebecca Traister. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=294.3s)]
*  Clearly, this was a candidate who was feeling stress, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=299.18s)]
*  and there was such intense scrutiny, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=302.94s)]
*  often ableist scrutiny, on how he was gonna communicate. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=305.18s)]
*  And he just did a debate in front of, you know, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=308.94s)]
*  the nation, you know, an audience of anyone who could listen. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=312.82s)]
*  And it was so transparent, he did fumble. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=315.3s)]
*  He did make verbal mistakes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=317.58s)]
*  You know, and it was all on view. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  But, you know, I think it's also really interesting. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=323.7s)]
*  You played a lot of clips. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=326.1s)]
*  There were moments where he was really strong, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=327.06s)]
*  including that Bernie Sanders clip, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=328.7s)]
*  including his very fluent and direct response [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=330.26s)]
*  on raising the minimum wage, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=332.98s)]
*  I thought was a really strong moment. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=334.14s)]
*  So we just keep clips like that around [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=339.62s)]
*  just for future historians to assess [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=341.86s)]
*  what went wrong in America. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=344.18s)]
*  And we wanted the hackiest possible response, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=346.26s)]
*  the most dishonest assessment ever offered [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=351.18s)]
*  of any public event, and we just played it for you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=354.7s)]
*  He was facing ableist scrutiny. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=358.54s)]
*  Because we're literal and we can't control ourselves, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=363.22s)]
*  you just heard her say that Fetterman [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=365.3s)]
*  had a strong answer to a question. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=367.38s)]
*  Talk about patronizing, by the way. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=370.42s)]
*  Well, we thought we'd go and check what was his answer. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=371.9s)]
*  You can assess for yourself whether this was, quote, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=374.9s)]
*  strong, here it is. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=376.7s)]
*  What do you say to small business owners [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=377.9s)]
*  who have told us that if the minimum wage [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=380.62s)]
*  were increased to $15 an hour, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=382.82s)]
*  it would put them out of business? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=384.9s)]
*  You have 30 seconds. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=386.94s)]
*  Now, we all have to make sure that everyone [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=389.02s)]
*  that works is able to, that's the most American bargain, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=391.54s)]
*  that if you work full-time, you should be able to live [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=395.74s)]
*  in dignity as well, true. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=398.98s)]
*  And I believe they haven't had any businesses [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=400.9s)]
*  being, we can't have businesses being subsidized [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=404.78s)]
*  by not paying individuals that just simply can't have aid [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=408.7s)]
*  to pay their own way. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=412.78s)]
*  Okay, again, we could fill the hour recapping [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=416.3s)]
*  John Fetterman's sad responses, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=419.62s)]
*  but it's not really that surprising to anyone [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=422.65999999999997s)]
*  who's been following John Fetterman [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  for the past five months. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=427.38s)]
*  You knew that he was profoundly cognitively impaired, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=428.58s)]
*  and it turns out he is. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=432.18s)]
*  So you learn really not that much new about him. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=433.98s)]
*  What you learn is that everyone around him, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  from his doctor to his wife, to the media, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=440.14s)]
*  to the Democratic party, they're all liars, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=443.22s)]
*  and they all just got caught lying. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=445.62s)]
*  The debate went on and on and on like this. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=448.34000000000003s)]
*  During Dr. Oz's closing statement, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=450.46000000000004s)]
*  Fetterman began shouting uncontrollably [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=452.14s)]
*  about social security until the moderator hushed him. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=453.58s)]
*  Really, look it up. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=456.42s)]
*  The effect over an hour is to make you feel very sad [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=458.42s)]
*  for John Fetterman. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=460.54s)]
*  This is humiliating. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=461.42s)]
*  The guy looked exactly like Billy Bob Thornton [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=462.38s)]
*  in the movie Sling Blade. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=463.90000000000003s)]
*  He really did. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=464.74s)]
*  He couldn't even read the canned lines [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  his staff was writing for him. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=466.98s)]
*  It was pathetic. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  You do wonder about his wife [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=470.18s)]
*  as you do about Joe Biden's wife. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  It seems cruel to do this to a man, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=473.86s)]
*  even for political power. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=475.78000000000003s)]
*  But again, it's the media who cover John Fetterman, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=477.70000000000005s)]
*  who should be the most ashamed, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=480.54s)]
*  they've known the truth, for months. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=482.26s)]
*  With only one exception, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=485.62s)]
*  that would be NBC reporter Dash of Burns. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  The media lied to voters about it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=489.82s)]
*  We don't know anything about Dash of Burns, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=493.06s)]
*  but she at least tried to be sort of honest. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  Here's what she said after meeting John Fetterman. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=497.62s)]
*  You'll hear he also still has some problems, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=502.74s)]
*  some challenges with speech. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=505.58s)]
*  And I'll say, Katie, that just in some of the small talk [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=507.9s)]
*  prior to the interview, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=511.02s)]
*  before the closed captioning was up and running, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=513.34s)]
*  it did seem that he had a hard time [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=516.14s)]
*  understanding our conversations. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=519.3399999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's not allowed. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=524.42s)]
*  So here you have a young reporter [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=525.7399999999999s)]
*  who clearly doesn't know the rules. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=527.06s)]
*  No matter what you actually see or experience or report, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=528.78s)]
*  you can't reveal anything that might hurt the fortunes [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=535.7399999999999s)]
*  of the Democratic party, that might slow down the team. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=540.9799999999999s)]
*  So clearly Dash of Burns hadn't gotten that memo. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=544.98s)]
*  And for daring to say that, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=547.86s)]
*  for honestly reporting what she saw, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=549.4200000000001s)]
*  liberals tried to destroy her. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=552.46s)]
*  Rebecca Traster again of New York Magazine said Fetterman, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=553.86s)]
*  quote, is not at all impaired. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=556.82s)]
*  He understands everything. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=558.58s)]
*  Molly Jungfast said she spoke to Fetterman and, quote, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=560.5s)]
*  he understood everything I was saying and he was funny. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=563.9s)]
*  Podcast host Kara Swisher, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  this is like the worst people on social media, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=570.3000000000001s)]
*  wrote this on Twitter, quote, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=573.58s)]
*  sorry to say, but I talked to John Fetterman [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=574.98s)]
*  for over an hour without stop or any aids. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=576.7800000000001s)]
*  And this is just nonsense. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=578.82s)]
*  Maybe this reporter is just bad at small talk. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=580.62s)]
*  Blame the girl, will ya? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=583.86s)]
*  Kara Swisher, of course. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=585.38s)]
*  And then Charlotte Alter of Time Magazine, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=587.82s)]
*  whatever that is, also interviewed Fetterman recently. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=591.4200000000001s)]
*  She knew perfectly well he was incapacitated, they all did. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=595.22s)]
*  But Charlotte Alter decided to cover for John Fetterman [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=598.26s)]
*  because supporting the Democratic party [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=601.5s)]
*  is of course her job. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=602.78s)]
*  In the hours before the debate, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=604.3s)]
*  Charlotte Alter did the bidding, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=605.5799999999999s)]
*  the direct bidding of the Fetterman campaign [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=607.06s)]
*  by trying to lower expectations. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=608.9s)]
*  That was their goal and she worked on their behalf. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=610.3399999999999s)]
*  Quote, Fetterman has never been a good debater. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=612.74s)]
*  Alter added, quote, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=616.5799999999999s)]
*  everyone will be watching for Fetterman's stroke symptoms. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=617.42s)]
*  I can tell you already what they are. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=619.9399999999999s)]
*  He sometimes says the slightly wrong word [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=621.74s)]
*  or conjugate something the wrong way. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=623.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=625.86s)]
*  They're not embarrassed. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=630.26s)]
*  They're caught working for a Democratic Senate campaign [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=632.1s)]
*  and they just shrug it off and keep going. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=635.46s)]
*  They never slow down. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=637.14s)]
*  So once Fetterman got on stage, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=638.9s)]
*  and there was really kind of no lying about it, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=641.14s)]
*  he humiliated himself, the usual chorus piped up, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=642.74s)]
*  not to admit that they were wrong, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=645.62s)]
*  but to say, yeah, he's demented, but it doesn't matter. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=647.26s)]
*  It doesn't matter that he's totally incapable [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=650.02s)]
*  of thinking or speaking. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=652.82s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=654.02s)]
*  Because abortion. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=654.86s)]
*  Abortion is more important than anything. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=655.78s)]
*  Because it's not a child sacrifice cult at all. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=658.1s)]
*  No, it's not, don't worry. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=660.1800000000001s)]
*  In response to a post stating the obvious [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=662.34s)]
*  that Fetterman is totally impaired, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=664.7s)]
*  a lawyer at the Democratic party's main firm, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=666.74s)]
*  Perkins-Coy, sent this Stalinist tweet, quote, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=668.66s)]

*  Delete it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=675.9s)]
*  Delete it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=679.34s)]
*  Abortion is too important to note the obvious. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=681.1800000000001s)]
*  Senate Democrats tweeted effectively the same message [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=684.34s)]
*  after the debate, quote, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=686.58s)]
*  Mamette Oz is a grave threat to a woman's right to choose. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=688.02s)]
*  John Fetterman will fight to protect abortion access [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=690.74s)]
*  nationwide. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=693.54s)]
*  That's their response to a guy who is literally [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=694.38s)]
*  incapable of talking. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=697.22s)]
*  So what do we learn from this? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=700.34s)]
*  We learn a couple of things. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=701.82s)]
*  Most obviously it tells us that abortion is more important [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=702.86s)]
*  than anything else. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=705.42s)]
*  Abortion is what really matters to the left. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=706.26s)]
*  And if you doubt that, consider the case of 89 year old [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=709.02s)]
*  Dianne Feinstein, who supposedly represents [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=711.5s)]
*  the country's biggest state in the US Senate. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=715.1s)]
*  At this point, everyone in Washington knows [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=718.42s)]
*  Dianne Feinstein isn't representing anyone. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=721.5799999999999s)]
*  She's no longer capable of recognizing old friends. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=723.66s)]
*  And in April, the San Francisco Chronicle to its credit [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=726.42s)]
*  ran a story in which former staffers, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=728.86s)]
*  not political enemies, but registered Democrats [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=730.78s)]
*  who voluntarily worked for Dianne Feinstein [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=733.5s)]
*  in which these people, her friends, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=736.26s)]
*  described Dianne Feinstein's mental decline [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=738.74s)]
*  and said that she was too senile to serve in the Senate. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=740.98s)]
*  So in response to that, Nancy Pelosi dismissed [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=745.22s)]
*  their firsthand accounts as quote, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=748.62s)]
*  unconscionable and ridiculous, not just wrong, but immoral. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=750.58s)]
*  In other words, shut up. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=756.14s)]
*  Dianne Feinstein is on our team and that's all that matters. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=757.82s)]
*  To emphasize that point, yesterday, Kamala Harris [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=761.9s)]
*  won a tirade not about inflation or housing prices [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=764.78s)]
*  or fentanyl deaths or the border [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=767.58s)]
*  or the looming nuclear war with Russia, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=769.74s)]
*  but about the thing that matters most to her [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=771.7s)]
*  and all of them, which is abortion. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=774.02s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=775.9s)]
*  Laws that are being proposed that would punish women [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=777.74s)]
*  who dare to exercise self-determination [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=781.9s)]
*  and make decisions about what they know to be [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=785.0600000000001s)]
*  in their best self-interest because apparently [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=788.22s)]
*  there are some, I call them extremist so-called leaders, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=790.58s)]
*  who have decided they're in a better position than she is [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=795.46s)]
*  to make decisions about what's in her best interest. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=798.1800000000001s)]
*  How dare they? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=800.7s)]
*  I think that we need to take back the flag on this issue. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=802.1s)]
*  This is about freedom and liberty? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=806.26s)]
*  Oh, it's about freedom and liberty, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=810.58s)]
*  says the childless middle-aged lady who forced women [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=812.7s)]
*  across the country out of their jobs [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=815.5s)]
*  because they wouldn't take the vaccine [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=817.62s)]
*  that she was pushing on them. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=819.38s)]
*  Suddenly it's their body, their choice again. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=821.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=823.34s)]
*  Barack Obama cut an ad for John Fetterman just a few days ago. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=824.18s)]
*  He's not ashamed to do that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=827.02s)]
*  His argument, of course, abortion again. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=828.1s)]
*  Watch. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=830.9s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, you've got some important choices [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=832.74s)]
*  to make this year, including who represents you [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=835.42s)]
*  in the U.S. Senate. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=838.82s)]
*  That's why I'm asking you to vote for John Fetterman [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=840.22s)]
*  this Election Day, November 8th. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=843.38s)]
*  So when the fate of our democracy [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=845.74s)]
*  and a woman's right to choose are on the line, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=847.7s)]
*  I know John will fight for Pennsylvanians. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=850.78s)]
*  You can count on John Fetterman. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=853.7s)]
*  Make sure he can count on you. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=856.1800000000001s)]
*  So when it all goes back to that one issue, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=859.66s)]
*  it always does. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=861.34s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=862.1600000000001s)]
*  We're not exactly sure, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=863.0s)]
*  but it's hard not to notice that it does. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=863.84s)]
*  But there's something bigger going on here. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=867.5400000000001s)]
*  Fetterman's candidacy, like Joe Biden's candidacy [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=869.1800000000001s)]
*  two years ago, tells us something pretty dark [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=871.9000000000001s)]
*  about the Democratic Party. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=874.22s)]
*  What it tells us is the Democratic Party [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=876.1800000000001s)]
*  has such contempt for voters and for democracy itself [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=878.0600000000001s)]
*  and so much confidence in its ownership [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=881.98s)]
*  of the media and of big tech [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=884.34s)]
*  that it no longer has to try to win your votes. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=886.1800000000001s)]
*  Democrats can run Raphael Warnock, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=889.42s)]
*  an aggressively anti-Christian, fake Christian pastor [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=891.78s)]
*  whose wife detailed abuse allegations against him [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=894.4599999999999s)]
*  on camera, and that's okay. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=896.9399999999999s)]
*  It's still good enough for a Senate seat in Georgia [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=899.5s)]
*  because the machine keeps working. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=901.26s)]
*  It's not about the person, it's about the party. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=903.3s)]
*  It's not about the individual, it's about the group. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=905.9399999999999s)]
*  And to prove it, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=909.3399999999999s)]
*  they can even run mentally defective candidates [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=910.18s)]
*  who can barely speak and not only expect them to win, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=912.26s)]
*  but expect you to accept the outcome [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=915.5799999999999s)]
*  no matter how transparently absurd it is. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=917.7s)]
*  On November 9th, they'll be telling you [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=921.3000000000001s)]
*  that John Fetterman got 81 million votes in Pennsylvania [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=922.5400000000001s)]
*  and they'll threaten to put you in jail [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=925.34s)]
*  if you don't believe it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=926.5s)]
*  Why wouldn't they do that? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=927.58s)]
*  They work with Joe Biden. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQe4_Z5bVc&t=928.7s)]
