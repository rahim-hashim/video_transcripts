# Tucker: This was a disaster for America
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, most people got poorer during the COVID lockdown. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=2.4s)]
*  It's probably poorer than they realized. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=5.48s)]
*  They're finding out now, unfortunately. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=6.88s)]
*  But the tech companies got a whole lot richer [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=8.92s)]
*  and it's simple why. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=11.84s)]
*  Politicians forced the entire population indoors [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=13.08s)]
*  at gunpoint. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=16.0s)]
*  So millions of people had no choice [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=17.34s)]
*  but to live out their lives [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=19.12s)]
*  in the lonely hell of the internet. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=20.36s)]
*  That turned out to be a disaster for America [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=22.84s)]
*  as rising suicide rates now attest, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=25.04s)]
*  but for Silicon Valley, it made for an epic payday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=26.72s)]
*  And that epic payday was soon reflected epically [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=30.04s)]
*  on the balance sheets of its biggest local lenders, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=32.42s)]
*  which was called Silicon Valley Bank. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=34.98s)]
*  In 2018, SVB had about $49 billion on deposit. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=37.84s)]
*  Three years later, that same bank had amassed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=42.56s)]
*  more than 189 billion. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  That is a gargantuan increase in deposits [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=48.68s)]
*  over a very short period of time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  It was certainly dramatic enough [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=53.28s)]
*  to have raised a very serious question and an obvious one. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=55.06s)]
*  What was Silicon Valley Bank gonna do with all that money? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=58.02s)]
*  Even the San Francisco Bay area, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=61.22s)]
*  it would be hard to find qualified borrowers [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=62.940000000000005s)]
*  for $189 billion. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=65.86s)]
*  You could not responsibly loan all of that money [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=68.7s)]
*  even if you wanted to. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=72.38s)]
*  So what would you do with it? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=74.48s)]
*  Now that's the question you would have asked [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=76.18s)]
*  if you were paying attention, both from inside SVB [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=77.54s)]
*  or from the federal regulatory agencies in Washington. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=80.16s)]
*  But it turns out nobody was paying attention. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  Nobody thought to ask that or many other questions. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=84.7s)]
*  Nobody thought to stress test Silicon Valley Bank [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=87.10000000000001s)]
*  in the middle of a boom. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=89.7s)]
*  And of course, that turned out to be a grave mistake. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=91.34s)]
*  But the remaining question is what were they doing at SVB [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=94.12s)]
*  and at the other banks that have either failed [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=96.62s)]
*  or come close to failing over the last week? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=98.42s)]
*  Well, they were doing what you would do [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=101.06s)]
*  if you were a mediocre but highly credentialed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=103.82000000000001s)]
*  irresponsible person with a narcissism complex [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=105.98s)]
*  who talked a lot about your ultra-marathons [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=108.66s)]
*  and your commitment to climate change. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=110.62s)]
*  If the central bank handed you trillions of dollars [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=112.42s)]
*  free with no strings attached, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=115.54s)]
*  you would party like it was 1999. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=118.38s)]
*  Or to update the reference, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=121.2s)]
*  you would virtue signal like it was 2023. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=122.34s)]
*  You would spend hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  bragging about what a good person you are. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=127.18s)]
*  And that of course is exactly what they did. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=129.7s)]
*  Consider Signature Bank. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=132.1s)]
*  Now Signature Bank was shut down by federal regulators [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=133.14s)]
*  this weekend on Sunday because it posed an imminent threat [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=135.54s)]
*  to the entire financial system. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=138.46s)]
*  Its demise marked the third largest bank collapse [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=140.58s)]
*  in American history. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=143.46s)]
*  Why did Signature Bank fail? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  We can give you the technical math-based answer, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  but here's the real reason. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  Signature Bank failed because it was corrupt. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=151.74s)]
*  That's a strong charge. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=154.06s)]
*  How do we know that? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=155.18s)]
*  Well, simple. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=156.12s)]
*  Its directors gave Barney Frank a board seat. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=157.52s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  Frank is the same person who was a member of Congress [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  in Massachusetts, wrote the banking regulations [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=164.82000000000002s)]
*  imposed on Signature Bank and all the other banks [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=167.86s)]
*  by Washington after the 08 collapse. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=170.06s)]
*  Barney Frank has never had a real job. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=173.18s)]
*  He has spent his entire life in politics. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=175.5s)]
*  He's elderly now, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=177.74s)]
*  but he has no relevant experience or expertise. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  So the only reason that Signature Bank hired him [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  is because he once regulated Signature Bank. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=184.9s)]
*  Now, if we were looking at a foreign country, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  we'd describe that instantly as what? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  A payoff. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=191.54000000000002s)]
*  The people who actually ran Signature Bank meanwhile, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=193.52s)]
*  the so-called bankers, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=195.62s)]
*  did not seem to spend a lot of time banking. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=197.7s)]
*  And of course, they didn't need to bank really [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=200.26s)]
*  because the Fed was guaranteeing them [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  a never-ending torrent of cash in the form of free money. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=203.94s)]
*  So what did they do? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=207.66s)]
*  Well, here is Scott Shea, the chairman of Signature Bank, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=209.42s)]
*  welcoming his employees [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=213.34s)]
*  to a meeting of the bank's critical Pride Council. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=214.64s)]
*  This video is from last December, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=218.16s)]
*  just months before Signature Bank slipped beneath the waves. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=219.5s)]
*  And the Pride Council in question, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=223.1s)]
*  as you will see in a moment, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=224.38s)]
*  featured a self-described genderqueer transmasculine person [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=225.62s)]
*  called Finn Brigham, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=228.62s)]
*  who arrived to teach employees about pronoun use. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=230.78s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm Scott Shea, chairman of Signature Bank, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=234.78s)]
*  and it is a pleasure for me to welcome you [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  to this multimedia, multicasted, multispatial meeting [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=240.52s)]
*  of the Pride Council. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=246.34s)]
*  And I'm just thrilled [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=248.24s)]
*  that there are about 40 people in the room. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=249.9s)]
*  I understand there are something like 190 people [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=252.02s)]
*  at watch parties. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=254.88s)]
*  So hi to you all at the watch parties. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, the most common pronouns [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=259.08s)]
*  that folks are familiar with are she and he. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=260.32s)]
*  Becoming much more common, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=262.64s)]
*  and I don't know if there's anyone [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=263.94s)]
*  in the Signature Bank world, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  but probably you have clients [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=266.36s)]
*  that use they, them as pronouns. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=267.68s)]
*  They're gender-neutral pronouns on purpose. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=270.0s)]
*  We talked about folks that are non-binary [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=272.14s)]
*  that intentionally don't identify as male or female. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=274.0s)]
*  So some of those folks use they, them as their pronouns. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=276.82s)]
*  Z is another gender-neutral pronoun, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=280.02s)]
*  and the other part of that would be here, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=282.28s)]
*  spelled H-I-R. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=284.24s)]
*  Scott Shea is just thrilled [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=287.36s)]
*  to introduce the gender-queer trans-masculine pronoun expert [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=289.2s)]
*  and to host watch parties [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=292.2s)]
*  so everyone else can watch him explain pronouns. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=293.8s)]
*  What did they pay that guy? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=296.6s)]
*  What did they pay that guy? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=297.56s)]
*  How much will they have to pay you [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=298.88s)]
*  to swallow your dignity, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=300.76s)]
*  to completely eliminate the possibility [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=303.2s)]
*  that your children would ever respect you [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  in order to put on a performance that embarrassing? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=308.64s)]
*  Probably a lot. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=310.8s)]
*  We don't know what he was paid. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=311.64s)]
*  Clearly a lot. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  Clearly the bank got a lot of money [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=314.32s)]
*  because trans-prominent experts are not cheap at all, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=315.16s)]
*  but Signature did have a lot of cash, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  of course, because the Federal Reserve was printing it, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=322.36s)]
*  and they got the first pass. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=325.92s)]
*  This is what low interest rates for 13 years means. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=327.04s)]
*  So again, this was going on four years. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=330.22s)]
*  Here, for example, is Signature Bank's music video. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=333.92s)]
*  Did you know banks made music videos? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=336.8s)]
*  Of course they did. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=338.52s)]
*  They didn't know what else to do with the money. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=339.68s)]
*  This one is from 2011. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=341.62s)]
*  Now you've come to Signature [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=344.24s)]
*  Show your clients what you're worth [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  Make them go, uh, uh, uh [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=351.76s)]
*  Clients just won't let go, uh, oh [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=355.2s)]
*  Now that you're at Signature [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  Come on, let your colors burst [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  Make them go, uh, uh, uh [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  Your big bank days were long ago [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=370.64s)]
*  Uh [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=373.92s)]
*  Sorry, it was a dance party at Signature Bank. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=376.8s)]
*  Bank, like there was banking going on. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=380.16s)]
*  It was a dance party at Signature Bank with pronouns. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's not the only video from Signature Bank like that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=385.64s)]
*  You can go online and find many others, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=388.6s)]
*  including their Broadway-inspired sketches. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  You could spend all day watching these videos we just did [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=392.6s)]
*  and are better off for it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=395.36s)]
*  But it's not just Signature. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=396.82s)]
*  The guy who ran Signature was really craven and repulsive, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=398.48s)]
*  but he's not alone. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=401.8s)]
*  No one at any of these banks [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=403.36s)]
*  seemed to spend a lot of time banking, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=405.12s)]
*  which the rest of us believed [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=407.7s)]
*  was the core business of a bank. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  But no, in fact, at Silicon Valley Bank, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=410.32s)]
*  only a single member of the board had any experience [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=412.64s)]
*  at investment banking. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  The rest were silly rich ladies. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=417.74s)]
*  The Daily Mail reports that every other member of the board [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  was an Obama or Clinton mega donor. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  One silly rich lady was such a sensitive soul, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=426.44s)]
*  of course she was, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=429.56s)]
*  that she had to go to a Shinto shrine to pray [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=430.96s)]
*  when Donald Trump won in 2016. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  We looked up her picture. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=437.0s)]
*  She doesn't seem like a native born in Shinto, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=437.84s)]
*  but whatever. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=439.44s)]
*  There was a lot of fashionable rich girl politics [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=442.08s)]
*  underway at Silicon Valley Bank, but banking, not so much. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=444.68s)]
*  SVB had no head of risk management [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=448.41999999999996s)]
*  for nine months in the year before it collapsed. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=451.2s)]
*  Ooh, guess someone should have been paying attention, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  but no, they're visiting Shinto shrines [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=456.08s)]
*  and they make dance parties with their pronouns. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=458.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, Silicon Valley Bank UK, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=461.72s)]
*  that would be the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=463.72s)]
*  in case the name didn't give it away, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  did have a head of risk management. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=468.32000000000005s)]
*  Unfortunately, the head was called J. Ersapa, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=469.72s)]
*  who didn't seem to know a lot about managing risks or care. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=473.8s)]
*  She talked mostly about herself [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=477.04s)]
*  because it's so, so fascinating [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=478.98s)]
*  to talk about yourself a lot. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  Me, me, me, enough about you or risk management, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=482.16s)]
*  let's talk about me. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=484.24s)]
*  And she did. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=485.36s)]
*  At one point, she described herself as a, quote, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=487.48s)]
*  queer person of color from working class background. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh yes, narcissism is so much more fun than banking. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=492.8s)]
*  So needless to say, the risk manager was working hard [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=496.24s)]
*  on LGBTQIA++++ plus rights. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=499.12s)]
*  How did that end? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=504.48s)]
*  How does it work if you run a bank like this [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=505.88s)]
*  and people would just talk about themselves [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=507.92s)]
*  and their identities as if those are interesting topics? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, this week Silicon Valley's UK banks, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=512.66s)]
*  UK branch sold for the fully publicly disclosed sum [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=516.68s)]
*  of $1, $1 for the bank. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=520.52s)]
*  But as you would imagine in a bank [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  where nobody cared about risk management, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  the collapse was pretty entertaining for the rest of us. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=528.28s)]
*  Of course, there's a tragedy at the core [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=531.3599999999999s)]
*  that imperils the entire Western economy. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  But the good news is we have videos like this. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a video that SVB put out days before it went under. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=537.56s)]
*  I think there's a big disparity between the investments [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=542.38s)]
*  and black led companies than other companies. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=546.78s)]
*  We wanna help close the Latino wealth gap. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=549.9399999999999s)]
*  Oh, more entitled people talking about themselves. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=554.38s)]
*  Let's talk about me and my identity. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=557.74s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=559.74s)]
*  Banking is boring. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=561.18s)]
*  The fed's got that covered. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=562.38s)]
*  Is this starting to scare you a little bit? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=564.78s)]
*  This is what banks are actually like? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=566.1s)]
*  And we don't want to alarm anybody [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=568.5s)]
*  or get censored by Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=570.02s)]
*  who is now on the record saying, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=572.42s)]
*  he does not want you complaining about banks. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=573.34s)]
*  But we should tell you it's not just signature SVB [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=576.14s)]
*  officials who talk like that. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=578.62s)]
*  JP Morgan, that's the biggest bank in the world, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=579.9s)]
*  we think as of tonight, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=582.6999999999999s)]
*  one of the few banks that consumers [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=583.74s)]
*  still have some confidence in, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=584.9399999999999s)]
*  put out a whole video about how they give out money, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=586.9399999999999s)]
*  not on the basis of economics or math, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=590.38s)]
*  but on the basis of irrelevant characteristics [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=593.54s)]
*  like your appearance. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=596.1s)]
*  They're judging the book by its cover. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=598.06s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=600.5799999999999s)]
*  The events of summer 2020 highlighted [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=601.42s)]
*  longstanding inequalities, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=604.0s)]
*  particularly among the black, Hispanic, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=605.8s)]
*  and Latino communities that has had [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  a significant impact on our country. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=610.4s)]
*  At JP Morgan Chase, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  a key goal is to help break down systemic barriers [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=614.88s)]
*  that have created profound disparities. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  That's why we committed $30 billion towards racial equity [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=621.04s)]
*  to provide resources and opportunity [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=624.76s)]
*  for our black, Hispanic, and Latino communities. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  We've invested more than $100 million [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=630.64s)]
*  in minority owned banks across the country [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=633.28s)]
*  and are building a more equitable [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=635.92s)]
*  and representative workforce. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=637.56s)]
*  We're committed to racial equity. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=642.3399999999999s)]
*  Am I getting a moral lecture from a bank? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=643.8s)]
*  From a bank? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=646.68s)]
*  Really a bank is telling America how to live? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=647.52s)]
*  Describing America, since you're a bank. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  Where's the left by the way? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  90 years ago in the 1930s, the last Great Depression, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=658.24s)]
*  nobody would have sat still from a moral lecture [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  delivered by a bank. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=665.4s)]
*  But they're very common now. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=667.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=669.4s)]
*  Well, a little history. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=670.72s)]
*  After 2008, a movement emerged called Occupied Wall Street. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=672.6s)]
*  At the time, it was at the cutting edge [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  of left-wing social activism. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=679.66s)]
*  And it did seem kind of organic. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  Most of these things are completely fake, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=683.6999999999999s)]
*  like BLM, obviously orchestrated. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=685.12s)]
*  But Occupied Wall Street seemed kind of real. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  It seemed like angry people. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=689.44s)]
*  And some people from Occupied Wall Street [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=691.2s)]
*  turned their attention to the head of JP Morgan. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=693.24s)]
*  Of course, it's Jamie Dimon. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=698.28s)]
*  They went to his office. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=699.8s)]
*  They held signs outside for 24 hours a day. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=700.64s)]
*  And they hassled other bank presidents too. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=702.8s)]
*  And before long, a funny thing happened. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=705.16s)]
*  Everybody in the media decided [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=707.48s)]
*  that Occupied Wall Street was boring. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=709.96s)]
*  Anything about economics was boring [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=712.28s)]
*  because who cares about carried interest? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=714.24s)]
*  What's that? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=716.28s)]
*  What we really want to talk about, they told you, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=717.96s)]
*  is racial oppression and your role in it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=720.72s)]
*  And so we got a lot of that only for like 12 years now. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  An endless parade of lies about this or that, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=727.52s)]
*  your complicity in systemic racism, police shootings. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=730.16s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=733.32s)]
*  Everyone's getting killed by the cops. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=734.16s)]
*  Hands up, don't shoot. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=735.08s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=736.24s)]
*  So we're all still talking about that nonsense, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=737.8s)]
*  ripping the country apart along racial lines. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=740.08s)]
*  But guess what we're not talking about? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=742.44s)]
*  Oh, banks. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=743.8s)]
*  Oh, I guess who loves that? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=744.64s)]
*  Banks. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=746.76s)]
*  They deeply appreciate that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=748.0799999999999s)]
*  And maybe that's why as BLM rioters torch major cities, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=749.92s)]
*  Democrats who took big money from big banks [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=753.3599999999999s)]
*  knelt in reverence to BLM. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=756.4s)]
*  We are here to honor George Floyd. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=760.24s)]
*  In a moment, we will have a moment of silence, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=766.52s)]
*  actually eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=769.04s)]
*  in honor of George Floyd and so many others [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=773.12s)]
*  who lost their lives or were abused by police brutality. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=777.88s)]
*  For those who wish to, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=781.5600000000001s)]
*  we will now kneel for our moment of silence. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=782.6s)]
*  Oh, so great. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=796.88s)]
*  What does everybody in that frame have in common? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=798.72s)]
*  Well, they'll have kentecloth robes on. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  A lot of them are wearing masks. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=803.16s)]
*  No, but they're all bank shills. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=804.04s)]
*  That's what it is, they're all bank shills. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=805.72s)]
*  They're shills for finance. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=807.16s)]
*  Of course, every single one of them, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=808.4s)]
*  and particularly the utterly soulless Nancy Pelosi. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=809.24s)]
*  She'll say anything on behalf of the banks. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=812.24s)]
*  The banks love this, of course, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=814.88s)]
*  they want to make sure it continued. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=815.72s)]
*  And that's why, according to amazing new analysis [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=816.84s)]
*  from the Claremont Institute, Silicon Valley Bank, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=820.2s)]
*  brace yourself, spent more than $73 million [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=822.96s)]
*  on donations to BLM and related organizations. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=827.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=830.6800000000001s)]
*  And this is not personal funds. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=832.08s)]
*  Apparently, these are bank funds. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=833.5200000000001s)]
*  Might be kind of nice to have that money now, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=835.36s)]
*  but it's hard to argue, even in retrospect, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=837.9200000000001s)]
*  now that SVB has failed, that that was a bad investment. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=839.76s)]
*  Because even now, as banks are collapsing, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=842.9200000000001s)]
*  no one immediate is anxious to criticize banks, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=845.2s)]
*  almost no matter what they do. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=847.2800000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter what they do. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=848.76s)]
*  Even if they were to just pulling us out of thin air, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=849.88s)]
*  openly profiteer from a war in Eastern Europe [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=851.96s)]
*  that's killing hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, it turns out they are. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  And we know that because Zelensky, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=857.9200000000001s)]
*  the president of Ukraine, and a very close friend of banks [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=860.36s)]
*  and BlackRock is bragging about it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=863.96s)]
*  Watch. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=866.0400000000001s)]
*  It is obvious that American business [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=867.36s)]
*  can become the locomotive that will once again push forward [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=870.1600000000001s)]
*  global economic growth. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=875.6s)]
*  We have already managed to attract attention [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=878.32s)]
*  and have cooperation with such giants [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  of the international financial and investment world [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=884.48s)]
*  as BlackRock, G.P. Morgan, and Golden Socks. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=887.88s)]
*  So we're getting moral lectures from the banks [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=892.96s)]
*  and we're getting a lecture on capitalism [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=896.32s)]
*  from some Ukrainian oligarch in a sweatshirt. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdB-cjcabvs&t=898.28s)]
