# LA County sheriff slams DA Gascón for failing to reign in crime
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A)
*  So you watch these tragedies unfold in slow motion the life around you degrade year by year and you think well [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=0.0s)]
*  I guess that's just the way it is now and then occasionally someone steps forward and says no [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=6.44s)]
*  It doesn't have to be this way [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=10.48s)]
*  You could actually fix this and it's not that complicated and that's one of the messages that sheriff Alex Villanueva [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=11.76s)]
*  Has been telling the rest of us here in Los Angeles. He joins us [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  We're happy that he is on the Fox lot in LA chef. Thanks so much for coming on [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=21.14s)]
*  Oh, thank you. So I know this is a everything's complicated. There's a complicated place [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=24.88s)]
*  But I don't think it's complicated to say the actions of one prosecutor really have changed life here [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=29.88s)]
*  definitely in his first year in office [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=36.12s)]
*  2021 his first full year he rejected over 12,200 cases for my agency alone and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=38.32s)]
*  Multiply that by two and that's all the other local police departments in the LAPD [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=44.8s)]
*  so his efforts is really almost nullifying the legislative intent in Sacramento where [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=49.4s)]
*  Misdemeanor crimes are seldom prosecuted if he believes is attached to homelessness or drug abuse [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  They're not gonna touch him. So obviously that's fostering a climate where homelessness drug abuse is just spiraling out of control [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=61.44s)]
*  You're seeing with your own eyes [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=68.4s)]
*  Well, you certainly are and you know if you love LA anyone who spent a lot of time in LA [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=69.92s)]
*  There's so much to love. It really is a great city and it's gotten worse and there's kind of no arguing that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=74.44s)]
*  He's the prosecutor you're the sheriff there should be a relationship between the two of you [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=79.88s)]
*  How have you brought this to his attention? Can you talk to him? Well, I've had one conversation with him [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=84.64s)]
*  That was his first week in office where we had an issue of mutual concern on a Kate one particular case [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=89.74s)]
*  But his predecessor we met every three months. I met her in her office. She met me in my office [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=94.56s)]
*  Yes, we shared concerns exactly what you're saying. We did with this gentleman unless you come from the public defenders office [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  You were a Black Lives Matter activist those are about the only people he's speaking to everyone else just doesn't exist in his world [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=108.32s)]
*  Just one question since you live here and run a big agency here. Is there huge public support for his policies? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=115.76s)]
*  Do you think no not at all? I'm seeing a lot of support from victims and you know victims matter [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=121.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=126.8s)]
*  Should be at the forefront of everything all of the criminal justice system is supposed to do now. It's all criminal offender [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=127.32s)]
*  Specific or offender centric everything is about reducing harm not to victims of crime reducing harm of incarceration [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=134.6s)]
*  For those who commit crime and that is astonishing leap of logic that not just George Gascon [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  But the Board of Supervisors has embraced the very same idea [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=148.2s)]
*  They call it care first jail last which has been an absolute failure here in LA County, man [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  I hope you take this place over. I really do use the democratic process just to restore moderate sensibility to the way [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=157.2s)]
*  It's run. I really hope that sure. Thank you. You got it [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSzNubGEe3A&t=162.68s)]
