# Tucker: Another one bites the dust
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc)
*  Tyler Morrell is a pizza delivery man for Coco's Pizza in Aston in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=0.0s)]
*  He was making delivery recently when he noticed a high-speed chase unfolding right behind him. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=7.0s)]
*  That's when he stepped in to help officers make an arrest. Watch. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=11.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a high-speed chase. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=17.0s)]
*  That's a high-speed chase. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=18.0s)]
*  Yeah, he... [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=20.0s)]
*  He better have hit my car, dude. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=22.0s)]
*  No! [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=26.0s)]
*  No! [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=27.0s)]
*  No! [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=28.0s)]
*  Holy smokes! Tyler Morrell, our employee of the month, joins us tonight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=37.0s)]
*  Tyler, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=42.0s)]
*  As a former pizza delivery guy myself, I never was called upon to do anything like that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=44.0s)]
*  I don't think I ever could have responded as quickly as you did. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=49.0s)]
*  How did you... Were you a former soccer player? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=52.0s)]
*  Like, what was going through your head? How did you do that so fast? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=54.0s)]
*  No, so I was a... I was a former lacrosse goalie, which I am attributing that quick thinking to my quick reflexes in the cage, so... [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=57.0s)]
*  I'm so impressed! I'm sorry, I skipped ahead. What was going on behind you? Do you have any idea? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=67.0s)]
*  So, right when I got to the door, I could hear the sound of sirens, and then right after that, you hear the loud screech. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=74.0s)]
*  You hear the car hit the curb, almost flip over into a house, and at that moment, I knew I was in the middle of something. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=84.0s)]
*  Did you ever find out what exactly it was? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=91.0s)]
*  Well, they were... They stole that car. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=95.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=98.0s)]
*  So, it was... They stole the car. There was a couple other charges that were listed there as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=100.0s)]
*  Now, what was so striking and so cool, and the reason we were so happy to make you employee of the month, is that you see these videos all the time, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=106.0s)]
*  and a crime will occur, and there will be some guy doing his job, delivering pizza, and 99% of the time, the guy says to himself, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=112.0s)]
*  you can almost see it, I'm not getting involved, like, this has got nothing to do with me. But you did not say that. Why? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=119.0s)]
*  It just felt natural to me. I just was raised to do the right thing, and that felt like the right thing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=126.0s)]
*  I didn't want anything to happen. I didn't want any sort of incident to happen. I didn't want... [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=135.0s)]
*  You know, just with the things that go on in this country, I just didn't want anybody to be hurt in this situation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=142.0s)]
*  I think I may have been the most hurt in this situation, but I was happy to take the injury for helping out the Brookhaven Police Department. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=147.0s)]
*  What was your injury? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=156.0s)]
*  So I have a very bad bone bruise on my leg because of that. I did not intend to catch him in the middle of my leg. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=159.0s)]
*  I caught him, I tried to catch his foot, just to make him trip a little bit, so the Brookhaven Police Department could wrangle him up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=167.0s)]
*  I just, I've got to ask, so this guy, you don't know exactly what's going on, but you know something serious has happened, a felony, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=176.0s)]
*  and this guy's running right towards you, and when you have to decide whether to trip or not, did you ever think, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=182.0s)]
*  like what if I don't trip him and he comes and shoots me? Were you worried at all? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=188.0s)]
*  Yeah, so my biggest concern, I saw him reaching. You could see him reaching when he was passing that one car, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=191.0s)]
*  and it looked like he was trying to throw drugs out of his pocket, so the pocket didn't seem big enough to have a gun, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=198.0s)]
*  so I kind of knew, even at that point, I would have just tackled him. I mean, I would have gone for it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=205.0s)]
*  You're the best. Last obvious question, did you deliver the pies in the end? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=211.0s)]
*  Yeah, pies were delivered unscathed and eaten on video. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=217.0s)]
*  Ridiculous. Man, if I lived, I'd order three of them tonight. Sausage and pineapple. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=222.0s)]
*  I would love to deliver them to you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=227.0s)]
*  Bless you for coming on and for what you did. Tell them you're out. Thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=229.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwOAL1terc&t=233.0s)]
