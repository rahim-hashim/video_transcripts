# Candace Owens tells Tucker the establishment is promoting 'neo-slavery'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw)
*  Candace Owens hosts the Candace Owens podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=0.0s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  I have to say, Candace Owens, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=4.2s)]
*  the one thing I will never attack Joe Biden for is his age [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  because it's the one thing he doesn't control. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=8.14s)]
*  And I have absolute sympathy for him. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=10.32s)]
*  I hope to make it to that age. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=12.74s)]
*  So this is not an attack on him for being old. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=14.0s)]
*  I'm just amazed that no one around him [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=17.0s)]
*  feels empowered enough to point out, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=20.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, you're too old to be president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=23.12s)]
*  Why is that the one verboten thing? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=24.96s)]
*  Why is that the one thing no one can say? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I do feel some sympathy for Joe Biden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=30.16s)]
*  because obviously he is mentally incapacitated, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=32.28s)]
*  but it does make you want to question Jill Biden [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=34.9s)]
*  and people like Giselle Federman [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=37.6s)]
*  who understand exactly what their husbands are going through, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  understand that they're being mocked on the world stage, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=41.56s)]
*  understand that they are struggling, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=43.44s)]
*  struggling even to form coherent sentences. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=45.26s)]
*  And yet they sit there and they applaud [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=47.32s)]
*  and they think we're just gonna keep hiding this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=48.64s)]
*  from the public all on their quest for power. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=50.04s)]
*  And that's really what this comes down to. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  Look, we can call these people incompetent, they are, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  but does incompetency matter? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=57.24s)]
*  No, because they're here to serve the party. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=58.72s)]
*  This is all the Democrats care about. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  You are here to serve the party. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=62.24s)]
*  And actually, if you are incompetent, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=63.28s)]
*  that's even better, right? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=65.36s)]
*  Because these are puppets, these people are on strings. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=66.58s)]
*  These people are to do what they're told [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=68.94s)]
*  and not to think expressly actually, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=70.4s)]
*  they are told not to think individually. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=72.52s)]
*  Think only about the party, do what we tell you to do. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=75.08s)]
*  And what we want you to do is to further disintegrate [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=78.16s)]
*  these communities, is to further denigrate these communities [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=80.56s)]
*  because what we are after as the party initiative [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=83.12s)]
*  is full omnipotence. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  And what they need to create is a new system of slavery. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=86.94s)]
*  This is why I call it, the ultimate thing that they're after [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=89.62s)]
*  is neo-slavery. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=92.06s)]
*  They want to make sure that no individual [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  holds power in this country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=95.46s)]
*  And so what you're seeing is something that's very evil. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=96.98s)]
*  You are calling out something correctly [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=99.42s)]
*  and saying that their final war is a war against nature. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=100.98s)]
*  It's a war against sanity. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=103.94s)]
*  It makes us question our sanity. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=105.74s)]
*  You would never think that we would be having these debates [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=107.34s)]
*  that we're having today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  People would be telling you that it's a wrong thing to say [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=110.06s)]
*  that an 86 year old is old, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=112.64s)]
*  Suddenly we're being attacked for this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=115.38s)]
*  Everything is given an ism. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=116.58s)]
*  And the reason is just as you correctly pointed out [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=118.1s)]
*  is because it is the final war [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=120.74s)]
*  and they need to make sure that they control even language. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=122.5s)]
*  Well, I think language is the key [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=126.58s)]
*  because they've cowed the population, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=128.1s)]
*  even smart people who know better [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=129.74s)]
*  into not saying the obvious things. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=132.66s)]
*  Their fear is that people will say the obvious things. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=134.78s)]
*  You're too old to be president. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=137.38s)]
*  Your trans admiral is a dude, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=139.06s)]
*  putting incompetent people in the cockpits [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=141.14s)]
*  of commercial airliners [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=143.46s)]
*  or having them perform heart surgery is insane. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=145.5s)]
*  You're insane. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=148.28s)]
*  Like none of this is real. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=149.12s)]
*  You can't allow this to happen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  And those are the very things [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=152.34s)]
*  that no one is willing to say. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=154.66s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=155.9s)]
*  I'm certainly not one of those people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=158.66s)]
*  I don't struggle to say exactly what needs to be said [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  and this is exactly why. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=162.02s)]
*  Because if they win this battle, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  there is nothing left, right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  There is nothing left. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=167.16s)]
*  And so I encourage people, I say, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=168.34s)]
*  no, you need to say the thing that you know is true [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=169.9s)]
*  because the problem that we're having right now [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=172.3s)]
*  is too many conservatives are acting like cowards, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=173.9s)]
*  They're saying we need to be nicer. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=176.3s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=177.9s)]
*  This is how they have gained so much territory. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=178.78s)]
*  This is how we are fighting them in the school systems, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=180.94s)]
*  how we're fighting them in the classrooms, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  how we are fighting them to simply acknowledge [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=184.36s)]
*  that women can never be men and men can never be women. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=186.4s)]
*  These are insane arguments, but they're able to happen [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=188.74s)]
*  because good people sit by and say absolutely nothing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=191.9s)]
*  while they run amok. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=194.88s)]
*  And so I also wanna say this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=196.38s)]
*  and it's very important to point out [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  the Democrats used to be quiet about their corruption, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=199.34s)]
*  right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=201.96s)]
*  They were quiet about their corruption. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=202.8s)]
*  Now they're corrupt openly and they're mocking you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=203.72s)]
*  And what they're really asking you is, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  and what are you going to do about it? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  So what? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  We knew Federman was mentally incapacitated [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  and we still allowed him to make it all the way [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  to the Senate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=212.94s)]
*  And what are you going to do about it? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=213.78s)]
*  So what we know that Joe Biden can barely walk. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=215.18s)]
*  We can see the early signs of dementia. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=217.82000000000002s)]
*  And what are you going to do about it? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=219.52s)]
*  It's a very fair question. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=221.28s)]
*  I'd ask the same to everybody out there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=222.56s)]
*  watching this program. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  What are you going to do about it? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=225.3s)]
*  Why don't you start saying the truth [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=226.96s)]
*  and having the courage to say it boldly? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=228.4s)]
*  Can I just ask you one last question [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=230.88s)]
*  as a wife and mother, which you are. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=232.48s)]
*  So here you have Dr. Jill and Giselle Federman [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  both cheering on their husband's political careers [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=238.16s)]
*  while one is effectively incapacitated by dementia [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=241.5s)]
*  and the other one's literally in a mental hospital. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=244.68s)]
*  Wouldn't you think that a woman who loved, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=247.24s)]
*  a spouse who loved her husband? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=249.32s)]
*  Say no, it's not good for him. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=252.34s)]
*  Why is Dr. Jill not the villain in this story? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  What is her problem? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=257.18s)]
*  What a ghoulish power seeking creep. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=258.48s)]
*  And the same with Giselle Federman. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=260.88s)]
*  Her husband's in a mental hospital, like what? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=262.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=266.24s)]
*  These women are monsters. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm not going to mince words here. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=268.5s)]
*  These women are absolute monsters. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=269.76s)]
*  If you were in a relationship and you love someone [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=271.32s)]
*  and you've had a family with this individual, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  you would never want to see them suffer, period. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=275.24s)]
*  Now imagine allowing them to suffer publicly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=277.48s)]
*  That's exactly what these women are doing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=281.68s)]
*  They are somehow have become creatures [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  on their quest for power [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=285.36s)]
*  and they should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=286.56s)]
*  But I promise you they won't be [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=287.96s)]
*  because it's all about serving the party [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  and if they have to sacrifice their husbands, oh well. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, if my wife did that to me [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=293.82s)]
*  because she wanted to spend the weekend at Camp David, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=295.32s)]
*  I hope my feelings would be hurt a lot. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsiIwR2TYZw&t=297.79999999999995s)]
