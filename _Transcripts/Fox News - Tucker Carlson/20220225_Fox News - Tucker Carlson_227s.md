# Tulsi Gabbard: This could have been avoided
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4)
*  So quick democracy check, the polls show, and these of course are taken before the invasion, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=0.0s)]
*  that the vast majority of Americans oppose getting involved in the conflict in Ukraine. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Delcy Gabbard has watched all of this in the beginning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=9.36s)]
*  Of course, she is a military veteran currently serving, by the way, a former member of Congress. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=11.76s)]
*  She's been denounced as a foreign agent for speaking on behalf of the majority of Americans. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=16.8s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=21.56s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=22.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=24.8s)]
*  So what's your reaction to what we've seen in the past 24 hours? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=26.04s)]
*  First of all, I do not in any way support Putin's decision to go into Ukraine. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=32.56s)]
*  It is causing and going to cause an immense amount of suffering for the people there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=37.48s)]
*  I've been to Ukraine a few times. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=42.64s)]
*  I have personal friends who are still in Ukraine, people who have nothing to do with politics, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  everyday Ukrainians. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=48.84s)]
*  And they're afraid, Tucker, and they're angry. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=50.6s)]
*  They're angry at Russia. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=53.16s)]
*  They're angry at America and they're angry at the failure of leadership that could have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=54.72s)]
*  prevented this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=59.48s)]
*  And that is the thing that is most tragic about this heartbreaking situation with this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=60.48s)]
*  war is that it could have been avoided if President Biden and NATO had done exactly [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=64.24s)]
*  what you were just talking about in agreeing, hey, we're going to take NATO off the table [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=70.44s)]
*  for Ukraine, something that both the U.S. and NATO have agreed is not likely to ever [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=75.88s)]
*  happen and something that is a legitimate security concern for Russia that they won't [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  accept having U.S. and NATO troops on their border within Ukraine. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=86.08s)]
*  Had the U.S. and NATO leadership done this, this situation could have been prevented. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  I think the problem here in America is that people who bring this up, people who ask these [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=96.88s)]
*  questions, people who challenge the decisions that the Biden administration has been making [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=103.4s)]
*  in this are smeared and caricaturized as traitors rather than actually pointing at the truth, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=108.36s)]
*  which is this administration is not acting in the best interest of the American people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  They are turning their backs on the American people. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  So now that the current policy has failed, and I don't know anybody who thinks the invasion [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=126.44s)]
*  of Ukraine is a good thing, how volatile a situation is it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=130.84s)]
*  People don't seem to want to address that question, but these things tend to escalate [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  in ways you don't anticipate, like sideways. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=142.12s)]
*  Are you worried about that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=144.86s)]
*  I'm extremely concerned about it, and this is what you and I have talked about in the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=147.52s)]
*  days and weeks leading up to this situation, forecasting exactly what we are seeing playing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=151.24s)]
*  out today, where you see this back and forth, where you have the leader of Russia and the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  leader of the United States of America saying, hey, yes, if they cyberattack, we are going [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  to attack back stronger. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=165.94s)]
*  This escalation of a tit for tat will only continue to increase, and no one, no one in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=167.5s)]
*  the Biden administration, the leadership in this country is saying, where does this go? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=173.42s)]
*  Where does it end? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  What does it resolve, and what will it continue to cost the American people? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=179.82s)]
*  The most dangerous thing is that we're talking about an escalation of conflict between the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=184.42s)]
*  two great nuclear-armed powers in the world who have nuclear-armed missiles at the ready [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=189.42s)]
*  prepared to launch at a moment's notice. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=196.22s)]
*  And so whether this could get to that point intentionally or mistakenly through a miscalculation, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=199.33999999999997s)]
*  as we've seen happen numerous times throughout history, this is the seriousness of the threat [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=204.26s)]
*  that we are facing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  I think that's nicely put. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4&t=212.89999999999998s)]
