# Tucker: Heroic lifeguard saves dog from drowning
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g)
*  Chase McCall is a Marine Safety Officer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=0.0s)]
*  with the fire department in Long Beach. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=3.2s)]
*  He just finished washing some trucks along the beach [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=4.68s)]
*  when someone told him about a dog in the water. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=7.36s)]
*  The dog was called Tofu [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=10.28s)]
*  and he'd been swept several hundred yards offshore [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=11.56s)]
*  into the Pacific. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=13.6s)]
*  So Chase McCall got on his paddleboard and wetsuit [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=14.96s)]
*  and rescued the dog. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=17.48s)]
*  He had help from another Marine Safety Officer [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=19.2s)]
*  called Devin Beebe who guided McCall [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=21.0s)]
*  to the dog with her binoculars. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=23.48s)]
*  Chase McCall joins us tonight with the dog he rescued, Tofu. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=25.64s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=29.12s)]
*  Oh, thank you both for coming on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=30.52s)]
*  So Chase, how far out was this dog? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  I'd say Tofu was swimming maybe [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  two to 300 yards out offshore. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  What, Tofu doesn't look like a retrieving dog, for example. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=43.28s)]
*  How did Tofu get 300 yards offshore? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=47.44s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  I heard reports from just beach patrons [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=53.16s)]
*  that they had been chased and her around [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=56.32s)]
*  trying to catch her for about an hour or so [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=57.72s)]
*  in the parking lot and- [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=59.44s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=60.92s)]
*  I guess she just jumped in the water [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=61.76s)]
*  and took off towards out to sea. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=63.12s)]
*  How did she respond when you tried to pull her [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=67.64s)]
*  onto your paddleboard? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=69.52s)]
*  I think she was grateful to see me there [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=72.36s)]
*  and a little relieved. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=74.28s)]
*  She looked a little tired and cold [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=75.72s)]
*  and came right up to me [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=77.48s)]
*  and made it easy for me to grab her [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=79.12s)]
*  and put her on the board. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=80.92s)]
*  So dogs can, I mean, dogs are famously [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=83.32s)]
*  not how to swim at birth, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=85.24s)]
*  but they can drown, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=86.08s)]
*  Oh yes, definitely. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=89.32s)]
*  Is this common if you rescued other dogs [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  from the Pacific? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=94.44s)]
*  We've had a few incidences where we've rescued dogs [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=97.84s)]
*  from the water. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so it happens not too often, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=103.88s)]
*  but it does happen for us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=105.72s)]
*  What did the owner say when you brought Tofu back? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=107.56s)]
*  So we didn't really talk to the owner [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=112.64s)]
*  until the next day. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=114.44s)]
*  So we handed Tofu off to Animal Care Services [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=116.64s)]
*  and through social media, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=118.8s)]
*  the owner was able to get the contact info [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=122.36s)]
*  on where she was being held. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=124.44s)]
*  And so the next day when I met the owner, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=125.92s)]
*  they were really grateful [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=129.2s)]
*  and just everyone was so happy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=130.28s)]
*  that this was a success story. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=132.4s)]
*  Are you a dog lover? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=134.76s)]
*  I am. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=137.48s)]
*  I can tell by the way you touch that dog. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=138.6s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=140.36s)]
*  Chase McCall, thank you so much for coming on tonight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=141.24s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq9L0l659g&t=143.64s)]
