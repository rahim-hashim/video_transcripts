# Xi is laughing all the way to the bank: Chris Miller
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI)
*  Chris Miller is the former acting secretary of defense the author of soldier secretary. He joins us tonight. Mr. Miller. Thank you so much for coming on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=0.0s)]
*  forging an alliance between Russia and China seems like the end of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=8.4s)]
*  American power in a lot of the world in a massive new threat that dwarfs anything [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=14.76s)]
*  Putin has ever done in Ukraine. Why would they allow this to happen? Do they want this to happen? What's the thinking? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=18.92s)]
*  Do you know Tucker first? I have to go there the VEC just announced that he's gonna run for president [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=24.16s)]
*  Did I hear that right in the last segment? He did. Yes, that's just amazing. So I'm literally second fiddle [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=29.6s)]
*  But you know, he basically gave I thought a great foreign policy lay down for where we should be going forward on this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=36.04s)]
*  Your question though. I got to tell you, you know the president I'm gonna give him props for you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=42.44s)]
*  know, his speech writers gave a pretty good speech and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=47.96s)]
*  You know [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  I look forward to him coming back to the United States and going out to Palestine Ohio or going down in the border [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=52.0s)]
*  Yeah, and saying the same sort of things that's irony Tucker, you know that because I'm generation X and I'm like a letterman guy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=57.36s)]
*  Right. So my point simply is we spent a trillion dollars a year on national defense and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=64.56s)]
*  My point from my book is holy cow that we have to look at this differently [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=72.04s)]
*  And we need to bring that money home and spend it on things here in America to make America stronger your point about China and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=77.2s)]
*  Russia is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=84.56s)]
*  So valid I I'll be a little bit [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=85.88s)]
*  Counterfactual on you're a little bit iconoclastic [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=90.16s)]
*  I think Chairman Xi and the Chinese Communist Party are laughing all the way to the bank right now as they make [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  As they play as they play us again [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=98.14s)]
*  Well, sure, but you know military and economic alliances are gonna affect our economy [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=101.88s)]
*  You got to think China's primary goal is to make money, right? I mean, it's a it's a business government and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=107.72s)]
*  If China and Russia are alive China providing I mean Russia providing the raw materials [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=113.48s)]
*  I mean this just makes the Chinese trade bloc much bigger and us much weaker. Does it not? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah with the 2500 mile border between China and Russia and with Russia focused on Ukraine [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  To the West right now. I got to think the Chinese Communist Party is just licking their lips going [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=131.72s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=137.24s)]
*  This we couldn't ask for better because you know as well as I do they have serious limitations on their natural resources and it all [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=137.72s)]
*  Lies to the north. So, you know, it's a little bit of an off-the-wall [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=144.68s)]
*  Answer, but I think the Chinese are playing the long game [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=149.24s)]
*  You know [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=152.84s)]
*  We we as you highlight so much on on your show is we have this short view and we need and frankly Vivek said [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  The same thing, you know, we have to look long term and I think the Chinese probably are playing this both pretty well [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  Of course they are as always and we're letting him Chris Miller. Thank you so much for joining us tonight [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxgbzi2-jI&t=166.68s)]
