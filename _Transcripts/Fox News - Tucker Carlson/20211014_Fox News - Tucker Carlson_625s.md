# Tucker: This is why Americans put up with woke garbage
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=0.0s)]
*  In January of 2000, Bill Clinton gave his final State of the Union address to the Congress. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=5.2s)]
*  Clinton used that speech to push for dropping trade barriers against the government of China. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=10.92s)]
*  Here's the argument he made. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=16.12s)]
*  Allowing China into the World Trade Organization, Clinton promised America that night, would [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=17.92s)]
*  quote, open China's markets to the United States and quote, plainly advance the cause [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=26.74s)]
*  In his last year in office, Clinton made expanding the Chinese economy one of his most urgent [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=31.54s)]
*  priorities. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=35.98s)]
*  To do that, he appointed a lobbyist called Steve Roschetti and put him in charge of the project. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=37.18s)]
*  Fast forward to today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=42.339999999999996s)]
*  China has been a member of the World Trade Organization for 20 years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=43.94s)]
*  Steve Roschetti has risen even higher in democratic politics. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=46.94s)]
*  He's now a top White House aide to Joe Biden. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=50.26s)]
*  As for China, it has indeed changed as Bill Clinton promised that it would. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=52.9s)]
*  China is now the richest country in the world. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=57.46s)]
*  Its police state is far more efficiently authoritarian even than it was under Chairman Mao. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=59.5s)]
*  China is a much graver threat to the United States and to its neighbors. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=64.9s)]
*  We're as far from peace in Asia as we have been since 1945. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=68.66s)]
*  The American manufacturing sector, meanwhile, is effectively gone. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=73.18s)]
*  It evaporated along with millions of middle class jobs. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=76.3s)]
*  Most of the objects you buy now are made in China. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=79.06s)]
*  Maybe you've seen the pictures of queues of cargo ships strung out into the Pacific [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=82.38s)]
*  trying to get into American ports to unload their containers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=85.86s)]
*  You will hear this scene described as part of something called the global supply chain. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=89.3s)]
*  But that intentionally understates what it actually is. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=94.06s)]
*  What you're looking at are America's supply lines. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=97.5s)]
*  At this point, we're effectively an outpost totally dependent on a faraway headquarters [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=101.02s)]
*  for the things we need to live. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=105.3s)]
*  Here's what it looks like. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=107.46s)]
*  Why so many empty shelves? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=109.38s)]
*  U.S. ports are backed up. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=112.3s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=114.22s)]
*  Cargo ships sitting in the sea waiting to pull into port. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  It's causing major U.S. retailers like Walmart, Home Depot and Costco to charter private cargo [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  ships in a rush to fill shelves for the holiday season. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  On the roads, there's a shortage of truck drivers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=129.18s)]
*  The White House says it's addressing the issues fueled by COVID-19, a labor shortage and increased [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=132.46s)]
*  demand. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=138.78s)]
*  Suddenly, for the first time in generations, Americans are having trouble buying basic [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=140.86s)]
*  necessities, the things they need. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=145.54000000000002s)]
*  A new poll by Rasmussen found that 62% of Americans said they have shortages in stores [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  where they live. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  The things they can buy are suddenly much more expensive. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=153.84s)]
*  The Labor Department reporting Wednesday, meats, poultry, fish and eggs increased to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=157.94000000000003s)]
*  combined 10.5% since September 2020. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=162.78000000000003s)]
*  But it's not just food prices skyrocketing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=167.5s)]
*  The Consumer Price Index shows overall prices are up 5.4% from a year ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=169.6s)]
*  More pain at the pumps, the national gas price rose a dollar since last year, AAA showing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=175.28s)]
*  the average price per gallon up from $2.18 in 2020 to $3.29 this year. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=180.0s)]
*  The Social Security Administration says inflation is why nearly 70 million Americans receiving [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=187.68s)]
*  Social Security benefits will see a nearly 6% increase in payments next year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=192.44s)]
*  The highest increase in four decades. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=197.96s)]
*  There are no signs that fundamentally any of this is going to improve anytime soon. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  In fact, on Wednesday, the administration acknowledged that your heating bills are likely [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  to jump by more than 50% this winter. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=209.24s)]
*  Those are the kind of things that people actually notice. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=212.84s)]
*  It hurts when you get poorer and many people are getting poorer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=215.08s)]
*  But strangely, the administration has refused to acknowledge this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=219.02s)]
*  If anything, they're celebrating it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  Last night, a Harvard professor called Jason Furman, who was closely aligned with the Biden [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=223.36s)]
*  White House, sent this tweet, quote, Most of the economic problems we're facing, inflation, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=226.88s)]
*  supply chains, etc., are high class problems. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=232.04s)]
*  We wouldn't have had them if the unemployment rate was still 10%. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=235.28s)]
*  End quote. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=238.44s)]
*  In other words, you ought to be thrilled to have less money. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=239.44s)]
*  It means we're winning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=242.44s)]
*  Ron Klain, who is Joe Biden's chief of staff at the White House, promptly endorsed that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=244.44s)]
*  tweet. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=248.44s)]
*  And that's delusional. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=250.28s)]
*  Or maybe it's intentional. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=251.56s)]
*  You pretend your failures are victories and some people will doubtless believe you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=252.88s)]
*  That seemed to work in Afghanistan. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=256.14s)]
*  Maybe it'll work here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=257.86s)]
*  That could be their thinking. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=259.2s)]
*  But it won't work here because domestic economics is not like foreign policy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=260.94s)]
*  People notice when their own lives change. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  When you can't buy Christmas presents for your children or manage to keep your house [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=267.24s)]
*  warm in January. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=270.26s)]
*  These are not symbolic problems. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  These are measurable declines in your family's standard of living and they have consequences. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=273.74s)]
*  If economic decline continues, and it seems likely to continue, you will see a profound [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  political reset in this country. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=284.3s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=286.8s)]
*  The only reason Americans have put up with the endless woke garbage that the left churns [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=288.04s)]
*  out by the gallon is because they can afford to put up with it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=292.18s)]
*  For generations, this has been a very rich country and affluence covers a multitude of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=295.82s)]
*  sins. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  People will tolerate a lot of things they disagree with as long as gas is cheap and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  the Amazon deliveries keep coming. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=304.98s)]
*  But when a society becomes poorer, people's attitudes change and they change fast. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=307.26s)]
*  For one thing, they become much less patient when they're mistreated. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=313.18s)]
*  You're firing me right before Christmas because I won't take your shot? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=316.38s)]
*  No, I'm resisting that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=319.74s)]
*  You're telling me my son can't get a job because he's the wrong skin color? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=322.02s)]
*  No, that's wrong and I'm going to fight it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=325.42s)]
*  Et cetera, et cetera. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=327.98s)]
*  Politics will look very different in a country with permanent shortages. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=330.26s)]
*  And this may be an unpleasant surprise for the Democratic Party. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=333.9s)]
*  The progressive left's entire program is built on the presumption of endless, boundless [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=337.42s)]
*  Of course we can afford that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=343.18s)]
*  We're rich. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=344.38000000000005s)]
*  People like Nancy Pelosi and Sandy Cortez and Rashida Tlaib believe that and they believe [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=346.3s)]
*  it as a matter of faith. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=350.3s)]
*  They talk about economics, but they have no idea how the actual economy works. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=352.18s)]
*  They don't know anything about the great American affluence machine. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=357.1s)]
*  They've never really had jobs. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=360.06s)]
*  The one thing they know for certain, dead certain, is that every good thing must be [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=362.02000000000004s)]
*  free. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=367.58000000000004s)]
*  But that's not how life works. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=368.58000000000004s)]
*  Especially not in countries that don't hold the world's reserve currency. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=370.38s)]
*  There's a reason they don't have drag queen story hour in Mexico. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=373.62s)]
*  People in Michoacan are worried about tortilla prices and cartel shootings. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=377.7s)]
*  They don't have time for that kind of nonsense. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=380.94s)]
*  We're about to become a lot more like Mexico. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=383.74s)]
*  It turns out our economy was much more fragile than we thought it was. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=386.62s)]
*  And if we'd known that earlier, we might not have elected an economic illiterate like [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=389.9s)]
*  Joe Biden as president. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=393.42s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden during the campaign explaining to CNN anchors that actually printing trillions [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=395.74s)]
*  of new dollars for wasteful government social programs will reduce inflation. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=400.78s)]
*  If you're pumping all of this money into the economy, couldn't that add to... [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=405.14s)]
*  No, look, here's the deal. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=411.7s)]
*  Moody's today, when our Wall Street firm, not some liberal think tank, said if we pass [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=413.18s)]
*  the other two things I'm trying to get done, we will in fact reduce inflation. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=418.18s)]
*  Reduce inflation. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=424.16s)]
*  Reduce inflation. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=425.92s)]
*  Because we're going to be providing good opportunities and jobs for people who in fact are going to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=426.92s)]
*  be reinvesting that money back in all the things we're talking about. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=432.48s)]
*  Did I say the campaign? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=438.48s)]
*  He was actually president when he said that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  That was this June when he stood on stage, looked right into the camera and told us that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  when you make more money, when you print more US dollars, the value of US dollars goes up. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=446.8s)]
*  And then you watch the CNN anchors nod like livestock. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=453.08s)]
*  It made sense to them. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=455.64s)]
*  But of course it's ludicrous. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=457.76s)]
*  As just about every sane person has acknowledged since, inflation is rising because the government [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=458.76s)]
*  has devalued the US dollar by making too many US dollars. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=463.58s)]
*  They're like sand now. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=466.88s)]
*  They're not worth much. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=467.88s)]
*  But still, the White House does not seem concerned. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg has been on leave from his job since August after adopting a child, paternity [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=472.84s)]
*  leave they call it, trying to figure out how to breastfeed. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=477.79999999999995s)]
*  No word on how that went. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=479.79999999999995s)]
*  But now he's back in office as the transportation secretary and he's deeply amused, he says, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=481.18s)]
*  to see that dozens of container ships can't get into this country. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=486.14s)]
*  As we're looking at these supply chain issues, how bad are they going to get for Americans? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=490.06s)]
*  And I'm talking specifically, you know, leading here into the December holidays where people [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=495.8s)]
*  are relying on getting goods, on getting presents. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=501.26s)]
*  Well, I think there's always been two kinds of Christmas shoppers. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=505.1s)]
*  There's the ones who have all their list completed by Halloween. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=508.5s)]
*  And then there's people like me who show up at the mall on Christmas Eve. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=512.42s)]
*  If you're in that ladder bucket, obviously there's going to be more challenges. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=515.6999999999999s)]
*  Kind of a funny little dorky dad story. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=520.9399999999999s)]
*  I wait till the last minute to shop for Christmas. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=522.5799999999999s)]
*  That's not the point, Pete Buttigieg. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=524.86s)]
*  The point is you're the transportation secretary and our transportation grid is broken. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=526.1s)]
*  And people can't get Christmas presents for their kids or food that they want to eat or [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  things that they would like to buy. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=533.92s)]
*  Our shelves are empty. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=535.06s)]
*  Is that a problem? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=536.1s)]
*  No, it's sort of amusing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=537.1s)]
*  The deeper truth is that people can't get consumer goods because we're too dependent [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=538.86s)]
*  on China because our leaders outsourced all of our production to a foreign country. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=542.22s)]
*  And now they're joking about it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=545.74s)]
*  And they want you to believe that's a good thing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=546.74s)]
*  And because they want you so badly to believe it's a good thing, their allies in the media [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=548.74s)]
*  are repeating that message verbatim. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=552.3000000000001s)]
*  So I talked to Kai Rizdal last night who explained to me about the supply chain. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=555.38s)]
*  Yes, it is terrible. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=560.38s)]
*  People want to get their things. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=561.46s)]
*  But it's also an indicator that the economy is doing well. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  People want to buy things and that it's backed up. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=566.1s)]
*  So let's look at the part that, hey, the economy is great. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=569.24s)]
*  People can buy things again. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=572.08s)]
*  They're out and about. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=573.08s)]
*  They want to buy gas. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=574.08s)]
*  It's, you know, okay, fine. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=575.08s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=576.08s)]
*  I think that's a little spin. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=577.08s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=578.08s)]
*  It is spin. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=579.08s)]
*  I'm just trying to make people feel good. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=580.08s)]
*  We're not making the case for credentials or expertise. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=581.08s)]
*  Just because someone teaches at Harvard doesn't mean he's wise or even smart. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=586.32s)]
*  But when you open your segment on economics by saying, I talked to a public radio host [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=589.52s)]
*  who does a show with the word economics in the title, and here's what I learned. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  You're not trying very hard. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=597.5600000000001s)]
*  Especially when his conclusion is, inflation is a measure of our success. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=601.36s)]
*  Be grateful you can no longer afford to eat meat. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=605.1600000000001s)]
*  You're doing your part for climate change. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=607.5200000000001s)]
*  Things are going to change if this continues. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=609.4000000000001s)]
*  You can believe that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=612.3000000000001s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMOlOA7F3E&t=613.3000000000001s)]
