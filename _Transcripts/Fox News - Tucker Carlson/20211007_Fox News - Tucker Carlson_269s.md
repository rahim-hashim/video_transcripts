# Deep state undermined Trump presidency: Glenn Greenwald
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc)
*  And we are honored to be joined by someone who's been thinking about this for an awful long time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=0.0s)]
*  That would be Glenn Greenwald, who writes for Substack. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=4.08s)]
*  He has been covering the national security state for decades, saying things that in retrospect have [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=6.72s)]
*  proved to be totally true. We're happy to have him join us now. Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=11.28s)]
*  So as just noted, you have been on the trail of the national security state long before most people [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=15.44s)]
*  thought it was anything more than a conspiracy theory, as we now say. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=21.2s)]
*  Who do you think is actually in charge of the government at this point? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=25.12s)]
*  GLENN GREENWALD, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=30.16s)]
*  It's bizarre, Tucker, because the Trump presidency brought so much evidence showing us [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=31.36s)]
*  who was. One of the video clips I always point to is when Chuck Schumer went on to Rachel Maddow's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=38.16s)]
*  show days before Trump was inaugurated, when he had posted something criticizing the CIA for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=42.56s)]
*  getting a rock wrong. And Chuck Schumer said, ethics aside, how can Donald Trump be so stupid [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=48.08s)]
*  as to do that to the CIA? If you challenge the CIA, they have six different ways to Sunday to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=54.16s)]
*  get back at you. And the entire Trump presidency was driven by all sorts of narratives from the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=59.36s)]
*  media about how these heroic independent generals like Mattis and John Kelly and H.R. McMaster were [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=65.68s)]
*  going to save us from the elected president. And there were all kinds of reports about how [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=71.92s)]
*  these security state officials would conceal classified information that they didn't want [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=76.56s)]
*  President Trump to have in order to manipulate his decision-making or even subvert or ignore [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  his decision-making, like when you would tell them to withdraw troops from Syria and they would lie [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=86.24s)]
*  to him and pretend they did when they just moved them instead. And this was celebrated while at the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=89.92s)]
*  same time, they would say, if you say that there's a deep state in the United States, which is nothing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=94.8s)]
*  more than what Dwight Eisenhower warned about, a permanent power faction in Washington that rules [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  the country regardless of the outcome of election, they would tell you that you were crazy, like you [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  were a conspiracy theory, even as they were cheering for the classic definition of the deep state in the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=109.36s)]
*  first place. So you have to be a conspiracy theorist or incredibly gullible not to believe that that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=115.28s)]
*  exists. So here's the evidence that won me over. You know, famously people say if you want to know [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=120.48s)]
*  who's really in charge, who you're not allowed to criticize. What's the one group Republicans and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=126.64s)]
*  Democrats never criticized? The national security state. I mean, Republicans are happy to go after [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=131.2s)]
*  the IRS or the education department. I can't remember the last time a Republican leader [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=134.88s)]
*  meaningfully criticized DOJ or the Pentagon. And of course, Democrats are exactly the same. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=139.2s)]
*  That kind of tells you everything, doesn't it? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=143.84s)]
*  Exactly. And the amazing thing is, I mean, for whatever flaws you want to point to in Donald [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=148.24s)]
*  Trump's comportment and governance, of which I think there are several valid ones, one of the most [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=153.76s)]
*  important things that he did was he deviated from that cage that presidents have been kept in, which [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=160.32s)]
*  is he told the American people there are these security state agents who think that they run the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=165.76s)]
*  government and he stood up to them and challenged their orthodoxies and pieties and showed Americans, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=170.8s)]
*  especially people in the Republican Party on the right, that these institutions are not noble or [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  benevolent, but are highly pernicious. They want to interfere in our domestic politics and they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=181.12s)]
*  ought to be deeply distrusted. I think that was one of the most important things he did. And it was [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=185.84s)]
*  for that reason, his willingness to criticize them, that they hated him and spent four years trying to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  undermine his presidency. And Tucker, the amazing thing is they always talk about the sanctity of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=196.16s)]
*  democracy. How is democracy more threatened than having unelected people who operate in the dark [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=201.52s)]
*  free to undermine and sabotage the person that Americans chose as their president? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you. Exactly. I mean, if you want to wreck democracy, that's how you do it. And I think [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=211.76s)]
*  there's a lot of evidence the last president was really concerned about their power on a personal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=216.16s)]
*  level. He understood how powerful they were. Really quick, do you think at this stage it would be [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=220.8s)]
*  possible for a president to push back and to strip the unelected power centers of some of their power [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=225.2s)]
*  in our government? You would need a big army behind you. I mean, that's why people in Washington [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=231.92s)]
*  were petrified of J. Edgar Hoover. He kept dossiers through the FBI on every politician in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  Washington. They do have a lot of amassed power. You need the population to rise up against them [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=242.48s)]
*  for that to work. Yeah, boy, I hope that happens just because, you know, I think democracy is worth [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=247.12s)]
*  having. I know you feel that way too. Glenn Greenwald, an anti-authoritarian. We're proud to have. Thanks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuceo6OCcc&t=251.92s)]
