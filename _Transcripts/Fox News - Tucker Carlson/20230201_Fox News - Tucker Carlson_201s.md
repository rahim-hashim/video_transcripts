# Mayorkas has willfully imposed his own dangerous policies: GOP lawmaker
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA)
*  In the history of jobs, has anybody had a more misleading job title than Alejandro Mayorkas? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the Homeland Security Secretary. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=5.76s)]
*  He has done nothing to enhance, but instead a lot to destroy our homeland security. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=9.0s)]
*  He's left the border open, and he lied about it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=12.56s)]
*  Millions and millions and millions of foreign nationals, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=14.96s)]
*  who identities we can't confirm, have shown up, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=18.32s)]
*  helped by the drug cartels, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=21.44s)]
*  and come into our country to stay forever and live at public expense. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=23.8s)]
*  That's all real. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=27.16s)]
*  Andy Biggs knows it's real, he represents the state of Arizona in the Congress, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  and he's very frustrated by this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=32.0s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=33.92s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=35.64s)]
*  So you've watched it, it's affected your state and your district, badly hurt both. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=37.12s)]
*  How do you think the Congress should respond? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=41.76s)]
*  Well, Tucker, thanks for having me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=45.4s)]
*  And I think that the appropriate response is to do what the founders said. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=47.0s)]
*  You remove somebody from office, a public official from office, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=51.12s)]
*  who's causing public harm and violating the public trust. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=54.68s)]
*  And that is impeachment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=57.88s)]
*  And I think that is the, quite frankly, the most pressing remedy [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  that we need to avail ourselves of with Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  What he has done is absolutely, in my opinion, it's unconscionable. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=67.80000000000001s)]
*  He's literally attacked the essence of this country [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=71.88000000000001s)]
*  by attacking the geographical integrity. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  And he's changing so much. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=78.56s)]
*  He's put so many people in danger. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=80.56s)]
*  We've got terrorists here that would never have been here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=82.44s)]
*  We've got criminal gang members. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=84.48s)]
*  And we've got well over a million people here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  We have no idea anything about their background, where they went, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  because they just got away into the country because of his policies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you can't impeach a Homeland Security Secretary [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=96.92s)]
*  for destroying the homeland security and allowing an invasion, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=100.12s)]
*  no exaggeration, an invasion to occur on his watch, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  then what can you impeach someone for? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=107.72s)]
*  Well, I think that's exactly right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  And so I've had people say, well, Andy, he didn't commit a real felony. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  And I said, but high crimes means that you're a public official [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=114.88s)]
*  and that you have violated the public trust and you need to be removed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  Look at just the damage he's done. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=122.24s)]
*  He came in and he basically got rid of every policy that was working. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=124.72s)]
*  We had the Yuma sector, Tucker, in the last year of Trump, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=128.96s)]
*  those policies had reduced the encounters to fewer than 9000 [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=132.64s)]
*  for the entire fiscal year. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=136.8s)]
*  Last year, that sector alone had over 360,000 encounters. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=139.0s)]
*  And then you stretch that along the entire southern border [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=144.2s)]
*  and you're pushing 3 million encounters [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=147.44s)]
*  and another million people who got in and got away. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  And those are the people that are bringing drugs, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=152.76s)]
*  they're human trafficking, sex trafficking. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=154.96s)]
*  They've put this country at risk. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  And quite frankly, the first thing that goes when a country is actually devolving [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  is when you lose your geographical integrity. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=164.16s)]
*  And Secretary Mayorskas, that's his main job. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=167.6s)]
*  And he has willfully imposed his own dangerous policies on us. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=171.64s)]
*  It's not negligence, it's not incompetence, it's willful. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=177.48s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a felony. He's ignoring the law. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=181.48s)]
*  The law that Congress passed, he's not elected. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  He's a bureaucrat. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=186.16s)]
*  Congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=187.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyHcfB-0aPA&t=189.84s)]
