# Tucker: Liberalsâ€™ use of Fetterman is the most cynical political move in US history
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=0.0s)]
*  John Fetterman is a trust fund kid. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=2.9s)]
*  He took money from his parents deep into middle age [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=4.86s)]
*  when he decided finally what he would like to do [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=7.08s)]
*  with the rest of his life, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=8.98s)]
*  which is to be the US Senator from Pennsylvania. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=9.86s)]
*  The problem is fate intervened [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=12.8s)]
*  and he can now no longer speak. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=14.42s)]
*  He had a bad stroke and we feel bad about that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=16.06s)]
*  Everyone does. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=18.54s)]
*  But because of that stroke, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=20.1s)]
*  Fetterman now needs electronic assistance [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=21.46s)]
*  in order to communicate with other people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=23.66s)]
*  Can't talk on his own. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=26.5s)]
*  It's not a right-wing conspiracy theory. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=27.62s)]
*  He's stuck queueing on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=28.96s)]
*  It's real. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=30.6s)]
*  In fact, it's so real, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=31.44s)]
*  his campaign concedes that it's real. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=32.260000000000005s)]
*  That it's true. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=34.04s)]
*  Fetterman uses a software program [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=35.1s)]
*  to understand the words of those around him [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=37.08s)]
*  and to formulate his responses to those words. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  In other words, to talk. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Now to be perfectly clear, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=45.2s)]
*  this software is not a hearing aid. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Fetterman doesn't need a hearing aid [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  because he isn't deaf. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=50.0s)]
*  He's not hearing impaired. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=50.84s)]
*  Instead, this program takes words [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=52.2s)]
*  and then rearranges them into language [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=54.68000000000001s)]
*  that John Fetterman can understand [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=56.980000000000004s)]
*  because his brain can no longer do that for him. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=59.220000000000006s)]
*  That's sad for transhumanists though. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  It is thrilling. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=64.54s)]
*  This is an amazing moment. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=65.62s)]
*  This is Neil Armstrong on the moon. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=66.92s)]
*  Here you have one of the most famous politicians [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=68.86s)]
*  in the country merging with a computer. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=71.04s)]
*  This is the future they imagine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  They're thrilled by it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=76.34s)]
*  But for everyone else, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=78.10000000000001s)]
*  for the voters of Pennsylvania, for example, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=79.04s)]
*  it does raise some obvious questions. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=80.54s)]
*  For example, where exactly does the software end [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  and John Fetterman's consciousness begin? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=85.72s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=89.68s)]
*  We can't know. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  But it's obvious that Pennsylvania [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=92.64s)]
*  could very well be sending a computer program [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  to the US Senate where inevitably it will be hacked. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=96.62s)]
*  Yesterday, MSNBC sat down with John Fetterman [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=100.94s)]
*  and his thinking machine to assess where the man ends [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=103.64s)]
*  and the machine begins. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  And the initial impressions were not at all encouraging. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=109.04s)]
*  We had a monitor set up so that he could read my questions [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=113.06s)]
*  because he still has lingering auditory processing issues [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  as a result of the stroke, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  which means he has a hard time understanding [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  what he's hearing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=126.26s)]
*  Now, once he reads the question, he's able to understand. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  You'll hear he also still has some problems, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  some challenges with speech. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=132.86s)]
*  And I'll say, Katie, that just in some of the small talk [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=135.18s)]
*  prior to the interview, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  before the closed captioning was up and running, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  it did seem that he had a hard time understanding [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  our conversations. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, good for her for admitting that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=151.3s)]
*  That's a rival channel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  Don't watch a lot of MSNBC, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=154.12s)]
*  but she should tell viewers that and she did. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=155.44s)]
*  And what she just told you is that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=158.4s)]
*  before the machine was turned on, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  John Fetterman could not understand human language, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  not even small talk. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  But once the machine was plugged in, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=166.82000000000002s)]
*  he sounded or the machine sounded nearly human. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=168.74s)]
*  But don't worry, everything's gonna be fine in the Senate [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=171.82000000000002s)]
*  as long as there's not a power outage. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=174.66000000000003s)]
*  It's not like the electricity ever goes down in this country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=177.02s)]
*  We definitely have enough renewables [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=180.02s)]
*  to keep John Fetterman voting the right way [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=181.5s)]
*  for the next six years. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=183.22000000000003s)]
*  Better build some more wind farms, that's the plan. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=184.82000000000002s)]
*  But once again, to the credit of the MSNBC reporter, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=187.74s)]
*  she did ask a follow-up. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=190.5s)]
*  How do we know your thinking machine [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  isn't gonna break John Fetterman? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=193.74s)]
*  Can we see a doctor's report on this? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=195.82s)]
*  Here's how that exchange went. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=198.92s)]
*  Can voters stress that you will be able [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=200.88s)]
*  to do this job on day one? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=202.84s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=206.76s)]
*  So you say you're on the road to full recovery, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  but right now voters really have to take your word for it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=211.76s)]
*  We've asked for your medical records, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=216.32s)]
*  we've asked to have a conversation with someone [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=218.92s)]
*  from your medical team to interview your physician. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=221.04s)]
*  You've declined those requests, why? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=224.02s)]
*  Well, I feel like we have been very transparent [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=228.54s)]
*  in a lot of different ways. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=231.24s)]
*  When our doctor has already given a letter [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=232.2s)]
*  saying that I'm able to serve and to be running. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=235.16s)]
*  I mean, respectfully, that letter from your physician, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=239.0s)]
*  that was six months ago. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=241.68s)]
*  Don't voters deserve to know your status now? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=243.7s)]
*  Being in front of thousands and thousands of people [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=247.5s)]
*  and having interviews and getting around [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=251.72s)]
*  all across Pennsylvania, that gives everybody [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=254.68s)]
*  and the voters decide if they think [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=256.32s)]
*  that it's really the issue. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=258.44s)]
*  So he's reading that off a screen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=261.66s)]
*  And by the way, we're taking him at his word [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  that there's not a staffer backstage [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  typing out the answers because he himself [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=268.0s)]
*  can't formulate them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=270.26s)]
*  Now again, you can feel deeply sympathetic to John Fetterman, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=272.18s)]
*  that's sad to watch, but this is a guy [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=276.12s)]
*  who wants to run the federal government [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  in a body of 100, the most powerful legislative body [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=281.46s)]
*  in the world, and he wants to be a member of it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=285.73999999999995s)]
*  So over at CBS, reporter Ed O'Keefe [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=289.14s)]
*  asked the obvious question, quote, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=291.26s)]
*  will Pennsylvanians be comfortable [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=292.46s)]
*  with someone representing them [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  who had to conduct a TV interview this way? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=295.06s)]
*  Now that's a mild way to put it, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=298.53999999999996s)]
*  but it's certainly a fair observation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=300.5s)]
*  The guy's reading his answers off a screen [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  with the reporter three feet away. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=306.29999999999995s)]
*  That's the definition of impairment. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=309.46s)]
*  And again, this is a very serious job, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=311.5s)]
*  but others in the media scoffed at the idea [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=314.34s)]
*  that was a problem at all. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=316.74s)]
*  In fact, far from being a problem, it was an asset. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=317.82s)]
*  Because if the equity agenda means anything, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=321.46s)]
*  it means that incompetent people ought to be in charge. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=323.5s)]
*  That's equity. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=325.9s)]
*  As New York City Councilwoman Rita Joseph put it, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=327.58s)]
*  questions about Fetterman's profound brain damage [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=329.41999999999996s)]
*  are, quote, incredibly ableist. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=331.41999999999996s)]
*  Ableist. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=334.82s)]
*  We desperately need more diversity in elected office, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=335.66s)]
*  and that includes people with speech impediments. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=338.66s)]
*  Well, we desperately need that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  That is absolutely right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=343.22s)]
*  But actually, we're not talking about a speech impediment. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  She's telling us he's got a stutter, just like Joe Biden. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=348.82000000000005s)]
*  Remember when they told you that Joe Biden's dementia [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  was just a stutter? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=353.14000000000004s)]
*  But of course, the speech impediment [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=355.82000000000005s)]
*  would not prevent Fetterman or Biden [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  from understanding other people's speech. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  Huh, investigative reporter Hunter Walker, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=362.7s)]
*  who writes for Rolling Stone and the New Yorker, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=366.02s)]
*  answered that question with a question of his own. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=368.29999999999995s)]
*  Hmm, quote. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=370.7s)]
*  Would they treat a deaf person like this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=372.02s)]
*  for needing assistance? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=374.06s)]
*  Oh, so if you have questions about John Fetterman, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  you hate the deaf. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=379.14s)]
*  You're a hearingist, bigot. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=381.0s)]
*  We're gonna close down your bank account at JPMorgan. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=383.62s)]
*  Ableist. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  But again, it's not really relevant [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=388.46s)]
*  to the Senate race in Pennsylvania, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=391.14s)]
*  because once again, John Fetterman [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=392.73999999999995s)]
*  doesn't have hearing problems. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  He's not deaf. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=397.2s)]
*  This isn't deafness. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  This is brain damage. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=400.08s)]
*  So the independents, Eric Michael Garcia, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=402.02s)]
*  tried to tie up that loose end, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=403.97999999999996s)]
*  and he used an analogy to do it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=405.14s)]
*  That's a really smart people talk. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=406.4s)]
*  How is this any different, he wrote, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  from Tammy Duckworth or Madison Cawthorn [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=410.02s)]
*  needing a wheelchair? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=412.46s)]
*  Oh. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=414.9s)]
*  So John Fetterman being unable to talk [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=416.18s)]
*  without reading it off a screen, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=418.94s)]
*  either from the software or from one of his staffers [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=420.52s)]
*  backstage, is exactly the same as being wounded [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=422.26s)]
*  in defense of your own country. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=424.94s)]
*  It's a war injury. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  And then John Fetterman's wife, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=430.18s)]
*  who came into this country as an illegal alien, by the way, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=433.1s)]
*  wondered the same thing, and we're quoting. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=435.86s)]
*  Truly appalling. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=437.9s)]
*  Have these journalists never heard of the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=440.42s)]
*  Americans with Disabilities Act? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=442.62s)]
*  Really curious to learn how they feel [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=445.08s)]
*  about wheelchairs and glasses. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=446.7s)]
*  End quote. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=449.15999999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=450.32s)]
*  So your questions about John Fetterman's mental health, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  the acuity of his brain, his ability to talk [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=456.8s)]
*  and listen and reason, use his higher faculties, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=459.84s)]
*  those questions are banned by the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=463.52s)]
*  Americans with Disabilities Act [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=465.12s)]
*  because he's not just an incompetent guy [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  trying to take over the country. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=468.32s)]
*  No, he's disabled. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=469.34s)]
*  Over at Vox, Ian Milheiser said he knows [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  exactly how Fetterman's bigoted critics [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=474.2s)]
*  view people with eyeglasses. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=476.36s)]
*  Dr. Kimmer Rouge. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=478.44s)]
*  Quote, is it the position of NBC News [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=480.08s)]
*  that a senator with glasses cannot be trusted in office [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=482.64s)]
*  because they use assistive technology [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=485.52s)]
*  to accommodate their disability? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=487.18s)]
*  It's so unbelievable. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  Not only can you not ask questions about the guy [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=493.02s)]
*  you're supposed to vote for and whether he can [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=495.44s)]
*  actually represent you in the United States Senate, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=497.4s)]
*  you're not allowed. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  He's fine, and by the way, the fact he's not fine [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=501.52s)]
*  is the reason to vote for him. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=503.6s)]
*  So they're hitting you for both sides. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  Vote for him because he's so profoundly disabled [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  and we don't have enough of those in the Senate. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=509.44s)]
*  But if you note that he's profoundly disabled, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  you're a bigot. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=512.76s)]

*  Have you heard this before? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=517.28s)]
*  Does it sound kind of familiar? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=518.1s)]
*  Where they take someone with an obvious impairment [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=519.52s)]
*  and then they use him to accrue more power for themselves. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=521.64s)]
*  It's not really about the disabled person, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=526.48s)]
*  it's about them. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=528.08s)]
*  And then if you ask questions about it, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=529.72s)]
*  shut up bigot. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  Does the term Greta Thunberg come to mind? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=534.0s)]
*  That's the girl who's always lecturing you [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=536.76s)]
*  about global warming and how you're evil. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=538.96s)]
*  Greta Thunberg is someone who needed help [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=542.12s)]
*  and concern from adults. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=544.38s)]
*  At the age of 11, she lost 22 pounds [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=547.24s)]

*  she was so depressed about global warming [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=551.28s)]
*  that she couldn't eat. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=553.28s)]
*  And then she was diagnosed with a whole suite [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=554.84s)]
*  of very serious problems, OCD, mutism, Asperger's. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  Very, very sad actually. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=560.96s)]
*  But the people around Greta Thunberg [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=563.36s)]
*  and the people who used Greta Thunberg [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=565.84s)]
*  didn't see this as sad at all. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=568.08s)]
*  They saw it as an advantage for them [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=570.12s)]
*  because Greta Thunberg could be used [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=572.26s)]
*  to accrue more power to them. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=574.44s)]
*  And you weren't allowed to say anything about it [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=576.84s)]
*  because she was disabled, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=579.08s)]

*  Here's Greta Thunberg. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=582.58s)]
*  You all come to us young people for hope. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=584.48s)]

*  and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=602.36s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=606.04s)]
*  So you look at that and on one level you think, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=608.6s)]
*  why is this person lecturing me? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=612.24s)]
*  Someone who's never had a job before [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=614.16s)]

*  That's crazy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=618.6s)]
*  And then the other level, the more deep level, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=620.0s)]
*  the more important level, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=623.3000000000001s)]

*  Here is someone who is profoundly troubled, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  who needs real help and care and empathy and love [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=630.48s)]
*  from the adults in her life, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=634.48s)]

*  Instead, she's being carted out like a sideshow freak [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=638.12s)]
*  for the profit of others. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=642.0400000000001s)]
*  They're using that child in exactly the way [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=643.78s)]
*  they're using Joe Biden and John Fetterman. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=646.56s)]
*  And by the way, Kamala Harris, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=650.2399999999999s)]
*  the dimmest person ever to work in American politics, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=651.7199999999999s)]
*  none of them have any idea what's going on. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  And they're being used by people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=656.3599999999999s)]
*  for the benefit of those people. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  But you can't say anything [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=662.28s)]
*  because you would be against people with disabilities [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=664.52s)]
*  and the ADA prohibits you from doing that, right? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=667.0s)]
*  You're supposed to accommodate Greta Thunberg's disability, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  pretend her words were profound, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=673.1199999999999s)]
*  just like the fake poet at Biden's inauguration. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=675.26s)]

*  Ha ha ha ha. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=679.7s)]

*  oh, yeah, it's so profound. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=683.22s)]
*  In Greta Thunberg's case, of course, the media loved it [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=685.62s)]
*  because they could use her too. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=689.02s)]
*  They could use Greta Thunberg. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=690.72s)]
*  They didn't care anything about, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=691.7s)]
*  she could die and they wouldn't care. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=692.7s)]
*  They'd find someone else to use as a marionette [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=694.06s)]
*  for their own political ambitions. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=696.48s)]
*  Watch them. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=698.8199999999999s)]
*  Perhaps the most impressive and impassioned remarks [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=700.5s)]
*  have come not from a president or a prime minister, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=702.92s)]
*  but 16 year old climate activist Greta Thunberg. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=706.1999999999999s)]
*  She is the teenager on strike for the planet. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  Our house is on fire. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=712.1999999999999s)]
*  Times person of the year. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=713.92s)]
*  Change is coming, whether you like it or not. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=715.8s)]
*  Greta Thunberg is leading a generation of climate kids. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=718.64s)]
*  Greta, first of all, I gotta reassess my life choices, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=721.7199999999999s)]
*  Chris, that is a force to be reckoned with. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=724.04s)]
*  Greta Thunberg, the Swedish girl who inspired so much, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=726.56s)]
*  she said she was in a deep depression [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=728.9399999999999s)]
*  when she understood the warnings of science, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=730.28s)]
*  and she said that she would turn that depression [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=733.28s)]
*  into action, and you see the result here today. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=735.0s)]
*  Greta's passion does reflect what really is happening, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  and we're still arguing whether or not it exists. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=742.08s)]
*  She turned that depression into action. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=747.16s)]
*  Well, no, she didn't actually. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  She's living in hell, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=751.88s)]
*  like most emotionally unbalanced children. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=754.32s)]
*  She's suffering, but she don't care because you can use her. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=757.28s)]
*  You can support her, to love her, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=762.6s)]
*  to cure her serious mental illness. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=764.0400000000001s)]
*  No, you used her to take more power, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=766.94s)]
*  and if anyone says anything about it, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=772.0s)]
*  if you think children shouldn't go on television [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=775.88s)]
*  to talk about climate policy and energy, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  then you're a bigot. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=782.84s)]
*  You hate children. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=783.84s)]

*  And by the way, as you sit and watch the results [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=788.1600000000001s)]
*  of the lunatic policy that she's espousing [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=791.08s)]
*  without even understanding Europe's energy grid collapsing, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=793.6800000000001s)]
*  then you're a bad person. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=798.44s)]
*  As Vox reported, attacks on Greta Thunberg [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=800.34s)]
*  exposed the stigma autistic girls face. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=802.6800000000001s)]
*  No, they exposed the callousness and cynicism [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  of her parents and MSNBC anchors and everybody else [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=808.64s)]
*  who used her suffering to their own benefit. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=812.1600000000001s)]
*  The Washington Post complained, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=816.86s)]
*  autistic young people deserve serious respect and attention, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=817.76s)]
*  not dismissal as the pawns of others. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=820.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=822.68s)]
*  Whose pawn is Greta Thunberg? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=823.92s)]
*  Yours. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=826.04s)]
*  Researchers at the University of Albany [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=827.52s)]
*  even published a study and tell a quote, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=828.8399999999999s)]
*  analysis of ageism, sexism, and ableism [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=830.3199999999999s)]

*  about climate activist Greta Thunberg. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=834.56s)]
*  Oh, so again, you need to listen to her [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=838.16s)]
*  because she's not well, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=842.56s)]
*  but if you note that she's not well, you're a bigot. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  It's the same, exactly the same dynamic [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=847.0s)]
*  you're watching with the President of the United States, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=851.68s)]
*  Joe Biden, who is not well and everybody knows it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=853.4799999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden mourned the death of Congresswoman [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=856.2399999999999s)]
*  Jackie Walerski publicly, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=857.88s)]
*  then a few weeks later he asked, totally befuddled, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=860.56s)]
*  why isn't she here at the event? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=862.5999999999999s)]
*  But if you notice that that happened, you're the ageist. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=864.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, my gosh, come on, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=869.52s)]
*  you can't go after him for, you know, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=871.24s)]
*  not giving aid to Florida [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=873.2199999999999s)]
*  or not tackling the infrastructure [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=874.4799999999999s)]
*  or not giving aid to Ukraine. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=877.36s)]
*  So you can't go after him for that, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=878.1999999999999s)]
*  but you can go after him for forgetting [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=880.04s)]
*  that someone has passed. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=883.04s)]
*  I mean, and she passed last month, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=884.96s)]
*  not like a hundred years ago. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=887.98s)]
*  I think what it really shows [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=889.92s)]
*  is that this country is so ageist. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=891.88s)]
*  This country has a problem with age [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=894.92s)]
*  and I think they need to stop weaponizing his age. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=897.52s)]
*  I hate that about this country. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=901.1999999999999s)]
*  This country has a problem with age. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=903.52s)]
*  So if you don't like the fact that commander in chief, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=908.0s)]
*  the guy who commands our nuclear arsenal [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=910.64s)]
*  is deranged because of age, which he is, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=912.52s)]
*  then you're the bigot. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=916.4s)]
*  But underneath all of this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=918.2s)]
*  is this single most cynical political move [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=921.4s)]
*  in the history of this country. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=926.64s)]
*  And that is elevating Joe Biden [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=929.2s)]
*  precisely because he is fading away, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=931.72s)]
*  because he is demented. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=937.2s)]
*  That's why they chose him. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=939.08s)]
*  They had an option, actually. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=940.14s)]
*  His name was Bernie Sanders. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=941.5600000000001s)]
*  We're hardly endorsing Bernie Sanders' program, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=942.6800000000001s)]
*  but Bernie Sanders could think clearly. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=944.88s)]
*  And the people who run the Democratic party [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=946.8000000000001s)]
*  just hated what he had to say. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=948.2s)]
*  So they picked a guy who had nothing going on upstairs, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=949.98s)]
*  who was flatlining mentally so they could control him. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=952.6s)]
*  That's exactly what they're doing with Fetterman. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02vdZlDJ6U&t=956.44s)]
