# The left is sending a 'very scary' message: Victor David Hanson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4)
*  A couple months ago, Justice Alito's draft opinion that if it became a decision to overturn [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=0.0s)]
*  Roe v. Wade was leaked. And in the wake of that, violent activists have harassed justices at their [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=5.68s)]
*  homes. They've also targeted pro-life groups more than 40 times. There have been dozens of attacks [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=11.28s)]
*  on churches and pro-life pregnancy counseling centers in recent months. Here's just a sampling of them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=16.4s)]
*  If abortions aren't safe, then you aren't either. That's just part of the message outside Wisconsin [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=23.68s)]
*  Family Action here and it continues inside the building. Madison police say it appears someone [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=28.96s)]
*  threw a molotov cocktail inside the building. This building was up in flames this morning when [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=33.52s)]
*  police and firefighters arrived and this is the aftermath. Broken windows, shattered glass, and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=38.64s)]
*  graffiti. CEO Jim Harden says this didn't come as a complete shock. Recently, Compass Care has been [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=44.4s)]
*  receiving threats online and in person. The graffiti on the side of the building says Jane was here [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=51.28s)]
*  and Harden says he thinks the abortion rights group Jane's Revenge is behind the attack. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=57.84s)]
*  Well, Nancy Pelosi, who as she has told us many times is very Catholic, was given a chance to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=65.04s)]
*  condemn these attacks, which would seem to be very easy for any humane person who believes in law and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=70.88000000000001s)]
*  decency. Instead, here's what Nancy Pelosi said. There has been a number of attacks on [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  on churches, on crisis pregnancy centers. Republicans are going after Democrats for not saying anything [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=84.08s)]
*  and they're saying that that's a rhetoric is contributing to these attacks on these crisis [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  pregnancy centers. What are their demands on this? Let me just say this. A woman has a right to choose, to live up to her [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  responsibility. It's up to her, her doctor, her family, her husband, her significant other, and her God. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=101.92s)]
*  I'm a very Catholic person and I believe in every woman's right to make her own decisions. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=111.36s)]
*  So how hard is it to say if you're purportedly a Christian and she claims to be, throws it in your [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=118.64s)]
*  face in fact, told us several years ago that MS-13 were children of God, how hard is it to say, you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=124.0s)]
*  know, whatever you think about abortion, I'm for it, you're against it. Fine, you can't attack churches [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=129.28s)]
*  and you can't attack faithful Christians because they're Christians, but she couldn't say that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=132.96s)]
*  It shows you that she's not a Christian, she's a poser and in a better of violence. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=137.2s)]
*  Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who joins us tonight. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming. Kind of chilling that the Speaker of the House can't [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=146.0s)]
*  just flatly condemn attacks on churches. Yeah, I think there's two messages Tucker. The most [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=149.92s)]
*  immediate is deterrence and I think when you can get away with attacking pro-life groups or you can [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=156.64s)]
*  swarm the houses and that's a felony to do so, Supreme Court justices and intimidate them or you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=163.68s)]
*  can swarm a Catholic diocese and break in during a service and there's no consequences. That sends [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=170.48s)]
*  a message and the message the left wants to send is you better be careful because the government [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=176.24s)]
*  is on our side and not on your side and they're going to selectively prosecute or arrest and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=181.84s)]
*  that's the message and it also empowers their own people, emboldens them. If we get away with putting [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=187.04s)]
*  graffiti on a person's office or burning down, what's the next thing? The second message is, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=192.4s)]
*  I hesitate to say this Tucker, but I don't think we're a society that is ruled by law. We're in a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=199.52s)]
*  revolutionary period right now, something like 18th century France or 1920s Russia where the law [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=205.52s)]
*  is fluid and it's whatever the power to be says it is. So if you're, just to take some examples, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=212.56s)]
*  if you're James O'Keefe or you're Peter Navarro or you're Roger Stone, you're going to have an FBI [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=218.64s)]
*  come down on you like you don't know what. But if you refuse a subpoena like Eric Holder did or if [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=223.92s)]
*  you lie to a federal investigator like Andrew McCabe did or you lie under oath to the U.S. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=232.64s)]
*  Congress like both John Brennan and James Clapper, there's no consequences, very little. And so the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=238.48s)]
*  law is designed that on the premise that the noble ends justifies any means necessary and the left [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=244.4s)]
*  has defined those means as radical equality, fairness, social justice, not the constitutional [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=254.16s)]
*  law. And so I think right now people are really weird, bizarre. They see May 31st, 2020, a mob [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=260.4s)]
*  from Lafayette Square tries to torch down a historic church, tries to swarm on federal property, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=268.24s)]
*  the White House grounds, sends the president into a bunker with his family and there's very little [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=273.44s)]
*  consequences as compared to January 6th. And so I think the law is very fluid. Merrick Garland is [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=279.52s)]
*  much to blame, so is Joe Biden. It's part of the left ideology that's in ascendance right now and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=286.08s)]
*  it's very scary because I think most Americans realize if you are of a particular political [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=291.92s)]
*  persuasion and you break the law or you're accused of breaking the law, you're going to be treated [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=297.12s)]
*  very differently than others. Oh, very differently. Yeah. Stephen Colbert is exulting in that fact [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=301.52s)]
*  tonight. Victor Davis Hanson, great to see you. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pINvQlK51U4&t=306.64s)]
