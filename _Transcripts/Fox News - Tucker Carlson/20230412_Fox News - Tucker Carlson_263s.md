# Donald Trump: America will be a second-tier country if this happens
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0)
*  Well, we're learning tonight from a leak from the Department of Justice to the Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=0.0s)]
*  Post that the special counsel investigating Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=5.08s)]
*  is now looking into whether he committed wire fraud. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=9.8s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  So as his numbers go up, the number of investigations multiply. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  This one appears to be related to Trump's fundraising efforts between the 2020 election [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=18.66s)]
*  and January 6th. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=23.1s)]
*  Of course, this is an effort to sideline the frontrunner in the Republican Party. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=24.64s)]
*  Will they figure out what to do with Joe Biden? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=29.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump is talking in a way that nobody else is about the most serious threat [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=33.64s)]
*  to this country, which is nuclear war, a nuclear war that the Biden administration seems intent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=39.92s)]
*  on sparking through recklessness and truly crazy behavior. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  And then, of course, the second greatest threat to the United States, the other thing you [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=49.7s)]
*  never hear about as we yammer on about trans rights, is the decline of the U.S. dollar. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=51.84s)]
*  We interviewed Donald Trump yesterday in Florida, and that came up. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=56.76s)]
*  Here's part of the conversation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Iran gets together with Saudi Arabia through China. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=62.08s)]
*  And China's taking over. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=67.28s)]
*  And China, you know, I heard a couple of people say, well, the dollar, we'll never lose the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=68.28s)]
*  dollar standard. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=71.9s)]
*  Are they kidding? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=72.9s)]
*  China wants to change the standard, the currency standard. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=75.88s)]
*  And if that happens, that's like losing a world war. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=80.8s)]
*  We'll be a second tier country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  We'll literally be a second tier country if that happens. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=85.36s)]
*  Now, you're losing Brazil. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=88.16s)]
*  You're losing Colombia, South America. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=91.12s)]
*  You're losing Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=93.8s)]
*  You've lost it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=94.8s)]
*  You lost Russia. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=97.32s)]
*  And if you haven't lost them yet, you're going to lose them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=98.32s)]
*  China's on the one. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=102.36s)]
*  So China's gone. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=103.98s)]
*  Then you see France going over and all. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=106.92s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  We're losing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  We lose our currency. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=111.04s)]
*  That's the equivalent of losing a world war. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=112.12s)]
*  Our currency is what makes us powerful and strong. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=116.04s)]
*  And this was unthinkable during the Trump administration. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=119.72s)]
*  And if I saw Macron do that, I would have called him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=123.28s)]
*  I would have said, you know what? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=127.48s)]
*  No more wine into the United States. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=128.9s)]
*  No more champagne into the... [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=131.08s)]
*  And I had that with him. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=132.86s)]
*  You know, I had Steve Mnuchin, a good guy, was unable to make a deal with France. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=133.86s)]
*  France is very difficult, I will tell you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=138.8s)]
*  Yeah, they're all difficult because every country rips us off. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=141.16s)]
*  But France is, in particular, very difficult. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  And you probably heard where they want to charge American companies substantial tax [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=147.84s)]
*  to do business in France. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=151.72s)]
*  So I had Mnuchin working on it and other people working. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=153.2s)]
*  And they were unable to do it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=156.44s)]
*  They called me back. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=157.44s)]
*  This was for a couple of months. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=158.44s)]
*  They could not do it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  I said, let me have Macron get him on the phone. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=162.2s)]
*  I said, listen, I understand you're going to tax American companies for doing business [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  in France. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  But here's the story. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  On Monday morning, if you don't drop this, on Monday morning, it was Friday, I'm going [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=171.84s)]
*  to put a 100 percent tariff on every bottle of champagne and every bottle of wine that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=176.88s)]
*  comes into the United States of America. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=182.08s)]
*  He says, no, no, no, that's not fair. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=184.52s)]
*  I said, of course it's fair. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=188.52s)]
*  You're charging American companies for going to France and doing business in France, a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=189.72s)]
*  very big tax. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=193.84s)]
*  So all of your wine, very good wine, but I think we make wine that's just as good, all [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=196.88s)]
*  of your wine and all of your champagne that comes in, I'm putting a 100 percent tax on. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  So good luck. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  Monday morning at 9 o'clock. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  That was it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=211.56s)]
*  I get a callback 15 minutes later. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=212.56s)]
*  We've decided we're not going to charge American companies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=215.16s)]
*  But you know what happened? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  Once I left, now they're charging them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=220.56s)]
*  So the takeaway from the interview we did with Trump yesterday, lasted over an hour, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=224.16s)]
*  was whatever you think of his answers, the conversation was about real topics. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=228.76s)]
*  It was not about global warming or systemic racism or trans rights. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=233.12s)]
*  It was about nuclear war, the U.S. dollar and its strength against other currencies, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  or trade balance, the things that actually define a country. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  They told you he was crazy for all these years, but why is he the only one talking about these things? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  Fox News' YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=254.04s)]
*  Stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=257.44s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQi0n0E1GF0&t=260.8s)]
