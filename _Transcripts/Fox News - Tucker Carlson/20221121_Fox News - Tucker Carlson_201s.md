# Dave Portnoy unloads on NY Times 'hit piece'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k)
*  When you're hiding something, you don't want that, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=0.0s)]
*  and they are hiding a lot of things. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=2.38s)]
*  They lied about that exchange, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=3.68s)]
*  and Portnoy, unlike most people, can prove it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=5.28s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=7.96s)]
*  Dave Portnoy, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=8.92s)]
*  So you grew up in Boston. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=10.24s)]
*  I think you probably grew up in a family [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=12.3s)]
*  that took the New York Times seriously. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=13.88s)]
*  You've lived in New York. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=15.98s)]
*  You may live there now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=16.96s)]
*  Were you surprised by this? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=18.06s)]
*  No, at this point, I wasn't. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=21.28s)]
*  But what you just said, I talked to my dad, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=23.64s)]
*  who is somebody who, what I say, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=26.26s)]
*  I trust the New York Times. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=28.0s)]
*  And that's the alarming part, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=30.52s)]
*  because in the way you just prefaced it, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=32.88s)]
*  I reached out to her seven months ago. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=35.52s)]
*  Tucker, they've been doing this for nearly a year. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  I knew about this investigation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  When I heard about it, I said, let's sit down, open book. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  I will answer any question you have. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=44.38s)]
*  And the thing about it, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=46.56s)]
*  and I don't care what your politics are, how you sit, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=47.56s)]
*  I am the witness of a story you are working on [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  for basically a year, and I am saying, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=53.94s)]
*  I will sit down with you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=56.16s)]
*  You can ask me anything. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=57.52s)]
*  I'm not saying lawyers in the room, nobody, just me. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  I will answer every single question you have. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=62.6s)]
*  She had no interest in that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=66.12s)]
*  She said, I'm eager to do it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=68.2s)]
*  Two weeks went by, I didn't hear. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  I reached out again, I said, hey, I'm still here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=71.78s)]
*  So she did this, she worked on it for nearly a year, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  and then she went ghost, crickets. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=77.4s)]
*  I didn't hear anything for seven months, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=79.68s)]
*  and I get the text, the list of questions that says, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=81.94s)]
*  hey, we want all these answers to all these allegations [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=84.68s)]
*  in 48 hours. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=88.12s)]
*  It would be the equivalent if this is a court case, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=89.48s)]
*  because that's what the time is doing, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=91.9s)]
*  try to create a case that I'm a scumbag and sway people [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  that you give one lawyer basically a year [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=97.64000000000001s)]
*  to present the entire case why this guy stinks, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  and oh, you have 30 seconds now to defend yourself. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=103.92000000000002s)]
*  Who would ever do that? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  Who would, nobody in their right mind, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=108.2s)]
*  she never had interest in telling the truth. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=109.66000000000001s)]
*  All she wanted to do was build a case against me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=112.68s)]
*  She never talked to any of my friends, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  anybody who would advocate. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  She never wanted to hear how we do responsible gaming, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=118.58000000000001s)]
*  training at our company. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  It was all a hit piece, and she had no interest [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  in hearing my side of the story. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=125.2s)]
*  What's so funny is it's about your personal life, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=127.2s)]
*  and you've got a pretty effervescent personal life, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=129.32s)]
*  but I've been in the media for 31 years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  You hardly have the creepiest personal life [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  of any in the media. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=135.8s)]
*  I mean, ghost the media. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=137.12s)]
*  These are creepy people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  Why are they trying to attack you on this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=139.96s)]
*  Because you're disobedient, right? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=142.72s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think I've become politicized [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  a little bit, but like what you said, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=148.24s)]
*  listen, I don't care if people don't like me, Tucker. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=150.0s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=152.16s)]
*  All I'm saying is give people the full picture. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=153.16s)]
*  That's, I, well, I'm disillusioned. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=155.4s)]
*  I know that's not what the Times does, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=157.8s)]
*  but how can you say, this woman has a Pulitzer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  They should take that back, break it, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=162.36s)]
*  and throw it in the river. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=164.0s)]
*  Like, all I'm saying is let people decide [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  how can you do such a one-sided hit piece [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=168.16s)]
*  and then say you're the New York Times [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=170.56s)]
*  and you actually care about honestly? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=172.0s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=173.4s)]
*  You're a liberal rag that is just like everybody else. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=174.28s)]
*  That's totally true, but you've got this legacy prestige [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=178.28s)]
*  that I really hope you do your best to tarnish [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=181.56s)]
*  because it's not deserved. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  Dave Portnoy, thanks for coming on tonight [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=185.68s)]
*  and for catching them lying yet again. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kZReFgKs-k&t=187.12s)]
