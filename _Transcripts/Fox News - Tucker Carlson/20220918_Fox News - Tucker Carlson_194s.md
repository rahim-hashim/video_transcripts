# Are some GOP candidates being betrayed by establishment Republicans?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE)
*  We noticed something interesting recently, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=0.0s)]
*  try to pay attention. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=1.76s)]
*  There are a number of significant Republican candidates [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=3.04s)]
*  around the country, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=5.24s)]
*  that would include Blake Masters in Arizona, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=6.08s)]
*  Donald Bullduck in New Hampshire, for example, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=7.84s)]
*  who seem to have been defunded [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=10.48s)]
*  by the Republican party in Washington. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=12.6s)]
*  Huh, why is that? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Something's going on here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Ned Ryan might know what is going on here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=17.78s)]
*  He's the CEO of American Majority. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=19.68s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Ned, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=22.0s)]
*  So maybe I'm just being paranoid, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=23.56s)]
*  though I'm not sure you can be too paranoid at this point, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=25.98s)]
*  but it seems like a lot of the candidates [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=27.76s)]
*  who are challenging the most basic orthodoxies [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=29.72s)]
*  of Washington, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=32.04s)]
*  views that are not shared by the majority of Americans, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=33.14s)]
*  people actually wanna make this a representative government, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=35.48s)]
*  are getting shafted by the funders in DC. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=38.0s)]
*  Is this happening? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=40.04s)]
*  It's absolutely happening. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=42.22s)]
*  I mean, Mitch McConnell's Senate Leadership Fund [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  just pulled $8 million worth of ads out of Arizona. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=45.4s)]
*  And Tucker, I remind people that the Emerson poll [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=48.96s)]
*  that just came out recently shows Blake down by two points [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=51.4s)]
*  against Mark Kelly, who's only at 47%. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  It's a winnable race. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=58.64s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons they're doing this, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=61.28s)]
*  Tucker, if we're being honest, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  the GOP establishment is not putting America first. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=64.8s)]
*  They don't want America first. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=69.0s)]
*  It's Washington first and America maybe eventually. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=70.2s)]
*  And you look at this behavior, it's by sociopaths. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=74.2s)]
*  You can only look at this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=78.16s)]
*  Mitch McConnell would much rather lose races [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  than have America first senators in the Senate [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  because he's petty, he's vindictive, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  and he despises the base. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=88.84s)]
*  And that's the only explanation, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=89.86s)]
*  I think it's the real explanation, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=91.34s)]
*  as to why he's pulling funding for Blake Masters and others. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=93.86s)]
*  He would prefer to be in the minority. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=97.34s)]
*  He's playing games. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=99.08s)]
*  Tucker, let's be clear. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=100.44s)]
*  He's playing games with the future of this country [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=101.3s)]
*  because he is petty and vindictive. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=104.12s)]
*  Well, it's also true, at least according to news accounts, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  that Mitch McConnell's family has benefited greatly [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=109.38s)]
*  from its ties to China, communist China. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=111.32s)]
*  So maybe it wouldn't be a good thing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=113.42s)]
*  to have other members of the Senate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  who are openly anti-China [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=117.14s)]
*  who might say something like that out loud [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=118.42s)]
*  because you're not allowed to say that out loud. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=120.02s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's a problem. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=122.66s)]
*  You don't want America first senators [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=123.66s)]
*  inside a Republican caucus, then it becomes unruly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=125.34s)]
*  You might not be able to control it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=128.02s)]
*  I've said this plenty of times, Tucker. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=129.86s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=131.52s)]
*  Mitch McConnell is a small enough individual [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=132.6s)]
*  that when push comes to shove, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=135.72s)]
*  all he really cares about is being the leader [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=136.98s)]
*  of the Republican caucus, even if he's in the minority. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=139.14s)]
*  That's all that Mitch McConnell cares about. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=142.26s)]
*  He doesn't care about being, really being in the majority. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=143.82s)]
*  He doesn't care about the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=146.5s)]
*  He wants to be the leader of the Republican caucus [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=147.86s)]
*  inside of the Senate. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=149.86s)]
*  And if he has America first senators inside of the caucus, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=151.02s)]
*  it becomes problematic for him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=153.94s)]
*  Therefore, I will pull funding, eight million worth, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=155.84s)]
*  from Blake Masters and other funding [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=159.18s)]
*  from other America first types [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=160.92s)]
*  because I'd much rather they lose than win [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=162.9s)]
*  and cause problems for me in Washington, D.C., [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=165.44s)]
*  even if it means I'm in the majority. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=168.1s)]
*  Man, I hope patriotic Americans can make up that deficit [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=170.52s)]
*  and get Blake Masters to the United States Senate [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=173.8s)]
*  where he can help clean the house. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=175.86s)]
*  I really do, I really hope. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=177.02s)]
*  Same here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  Ned Ryan, thank you so much for that analysis. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=179.10000000000002s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHkEkAHNQE&t=182.10000000000002s)]
