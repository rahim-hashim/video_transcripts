# Hawley: TSA is sending a message - if you follow the law, you're a sucker
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI)
*  If you plan to travel by plane anywhere in the United States, you're going to have to provide [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=0.0s)]
*  identification several times. Now, of course, that's racist, but what's interesting is that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=4.08s)]
*  requirement does not apply to illegal aliens. Today, the director of the TSA admitted that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=8.56s)]
*  hundreds of illegal aliens have been allowed to board airplanes just by showing their arrest [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  warrants. He admitted that while being questioned by Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who joins us [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=18.0s)]
*  tonight. Senator, thanks so much for coming on. Thanks for asking that question. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=24.0s)]
*  Can I get on a plane by showing my arrest warrant now? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=27.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, apparently you can, Tucker. I mean, here's the thing. It is utter and total contempt [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=32.64s)]
*  that this administration is showing for the law-abiding citizens of the United States. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=38.16s)]
*  What they're telling us is wait in the longest lines ever, be treated to all kinds of random [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=41.92s)]
*  inspections and invasive procedures and have your stuff confiscated. But if you're an illegal alien [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=46.8s)]
*  and you have committed a crime, oh, and you have an arrest warrant, come right to the front of the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=51.36s)]
*  line and get right on the plane. And as you said, the TSA administrator told me today that maybe a [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=55.92s)]
*  thousand such illegal aliens just this calendar year alone have been able to use their arrest [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=61.68s)]
*  warrants to get on planes. It is unbelievable and fly free at a time of rising fares. So I know [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  you're a lawmaker. This may make you uncomfortable. Why should I obey the law again? Well, I mean, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=72.16s)]
*  that's exactly the message the administration's sending is that if you obey the law, basically [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  you're a sucker. I mean, this is the message to law-abiding citizens that you're scum, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=81.68s)]
*  you do as you're told, you stand there, you wait, but oh no, if you're a criminal, hey, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=86.48s)]
*  we're fine with that because they want to normalize crime, Tucker. They want to normalize [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  illegal immigration. They want to normalize rioting. They want to normalize all of that stuff. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=94.56s)]
*  And here we have it. My favorite part of the hearing, Tucker, was when the TSA administrator [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=98.72s)]
*  said to me, oh, we're only concerned about people who might pose a risk to flight. You know, I said [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=102.48s)]
*  being a confirmed criminal and having an arrest warrant isn't a risk in the air. And he just [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=108.4s)]
*  looked at me blankly. He said, oh, well, that's not our problem. Apparently it's the American [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=113.36s)]
*  people's problem. Why are none of these undocumented migrants being flown to Martha's Vineyard? I [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  checked this morning, 0.03% of people in Martha's Vineyard arrive from another country. There's no [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=123.84s)]
*  diversity there whatsoever. None. So why aren't they going there? Why are they going to central [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=128.56s)]
*  Pennsylvania? You know, I think the answer is Tucker, because liberal leaders are always for [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=132.64s)]
*  their policies for someone else. You know, they don't want you to be able to buy gas, but they [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=138.23999999999998s)]
*  want to be able to fly around in their private planes. They don't want you to be able to, they [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  want you to have to follow the law, but they're not going to follow the law. They don't want to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=149.27999999999997s)]
*  have to accept any illegal immigration or illegal immigrants in their communities. But of course, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=152.48s)]
*  they want to send them to everybody else's. I mean, that's the real truth here. And we're seeing it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  all over the country. It's the latest example. We need a massive airlift to Aspen, and we're [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=160.32s)]
*  going to do a whole show on that soon, because I think it's a really good idea. We need to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=165.2s)]
*  decolonize Aspen. I can't wait. Senator Hawley, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=168.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkB1nK8DiI&t=173.35999999999999s)]
