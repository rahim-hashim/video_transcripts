# Tucker: Who is really in charge?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we're glad you're here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=3.04s)]
*  We had a diplomatic incident last month [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=4.4s)]
*  and a lot of Americans didn't even know what happened. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=7.2s)]
*  The government of France did something they haven't done [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=9.8s)]
*  in hundreds of years. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=12.08s)]
*  They recalled their ambassador to the United States. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  They also accused the United States of behaving [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=16.52s)]
*  in a manner that is quote, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=18.44s)]
*  unacceptable between allies and partners. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=19.44s)]
*  Now it wasn't a cheese embargo that made the French mad. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=22.72s)]
*  They were angry that the Biden administration agreed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=25.44s)]
*  to provide nuclear power submarines to Australia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=28.08s)]
*  France had wanted to sell its own submarines [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=30.959999999999997s)]
*  and the Biden administration effectively killed that deal. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=33.12s)]
*  It hurt France and they were mad about it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=36.0s)]
*  Now we haven't had a problem with France this profound [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=38.28s)]
*  since to be specific, 1798. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=41.16s)]
*  John Adams was president then. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=44.64s)]
*  And the interesting thing is he had no idea [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  that we had a problem with France. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=48.64s)]
*  It took months for words to reach him back in Washington [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  that American and French diplomats [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=53.4s)]
*  were fighting with one another. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=55.08s)]
*  By the time Adams learned about this diplomatic dispute, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=56.76s)]
*  which became known as the XYZ affair, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  it was too late to stop it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  A naval war, mostly fought in the Caribbean, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  broke out between the United States and France. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=66.32s)]
*  So the lesson from that conflict was pretty simple. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=69.16s)]
*  If you're gonna run the United States, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=71.52s)]
*  you have to be pretty aware [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=73.0s)]
*  of what the rest of the world is doing, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  particularly major world powers, particularly your allies. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=75.92s)]
*  So with that in mind, John Kerry, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=80.36s)]
*  the former secretary of state, now our climate czar, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=82.24s)]
*  was asked what happened here? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=84.68s)]
*  And his response was really simple. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  Like John Adams, Joe Biden had no idea [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=89.48s)]
*  that the French were upset. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  Now, unlike John Adams, our current president [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  has the benefit of cell phones and the internet, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=97.4s)]
*  but he still didn't know. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=101.56s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't know because he's in mental decline. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=103.2s)]
*  There are a lot of things he doesn't know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=105.92000000000002s)]
*  including when our allies are furious with us [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  and start withdrawing their ambassadors. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=110.76s)]
*  So Kerry was asked to explain all this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=112.84s)]
*  by a French news channel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=115.52s)]
*  Why did the Biden administration cut France [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  out of a nuclear submarine deal with Australia? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  And his response was amazing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=120.44s)]
*  He said, Joe Biden did this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=122.88s)]
*  because Joe Biden was completely unaware [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=124.36s)]
*  there was a problem in the first place. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=126.32s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  And President Biden asked me about it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=128.84s)]
*  and I told him and expressed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=131.0s)]
*  You told Joe Biden that it was not the right thing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=133.64s)]
*  He asked me, he said, what's the situation? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=135.6s)]
*  And I explained exactly, he had not been aware of that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  He literally had not been aware of what had transpired. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=141.88s)]
*  When was the last time you heard someone [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=148.96s)]
*  from the US government admit [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  that the president was completely clueless? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=152.92s)]
*  Quote, he literally had not been aware [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=154.44s)]
*  of what had transpired. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=156.48s)]
*  Now you're probably not shocked by that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=158.28s)]
*  Joe Biden was visibly confused [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=160.0s)]
*  throughout the entire presidential campaign. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=161.88s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  Hi, Alan. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=164.88s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=165.72s)]
*  Hey, good evening. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=166.56s)]
*  Thanks so much for tuning in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=167.72s)]
*  No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=170.08s)]
*  other than in self-defense and that rarely ever occurs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=175.68s)]
*  And so we have to just change the culture, period, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=179.44s)]
*  and keep punching at it and punching at it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=182.28s)]
*  and punching at it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  Play the radio, make sure the television, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=185.58s)]
*  excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=187.8s)]
*  Four kids are just as bright [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=191.12s)]
*  and just as talented as white kids. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  We choose science over fiction. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  We choose truth over facts. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  And we're not trying to be mean. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  As we've said many times, we feel sorry for Joe Biden. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=201.96s)]
*  All of us hope to live to the age [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=204.44000000000003s)]
*  where we face those kinds of problems. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  And the truth is voters knew what they were getting [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  when they voted for Joe Biden. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=210.0s)]
*  What's interesting is that now that he's in office, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=212.24s)]
*  Biden's handlers are doing everything they can [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=214.4s)]
*  to prevent us from noticing that he's not really in charge. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=216.12s)]
*  Take a look at the latest example. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=219.68s)]
*  These are pictures of a fake White House set [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=220.8s)]
*  that the Biden administration has, for some reason, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  constructed across the street from the actual White House. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=225.84s)]
*  It's in an auditorium [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=228.64s)]
*  at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=229.55999999999997s)]
*  Why go to the trouble? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=231.88s)]
*  They already have a White House. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=232.7s)]
*  Well, Stephen Miller spent the last four years [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=234.6s)]
*  in the White House as an advisor to Trump. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=236.55999999999997s)]
*  And here's his explanation for it, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=238.64s)]
*  because he would know, quote, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  "'The reason Biden uses this bizarre virtual set [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  for televised meetings and not an actual room, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=244.64s)]
*  like the East Room, the Cabinet, the Oval, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  the Roosevelt Sit Room, et cetera, there are a lot of rooms. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=248.56s)]
*  The reason he does this is because it allows him [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=250.88s)]
*  to read a script directly from a face-on monitor [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=253.2s)]
*  and without teleprompter glass that can be seen on camera.'" [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=255.96s)]
*  Oh, now we can't verify that that's true, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=259.72s)]
*  but it certainly sounds right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden can't speak from the Oval Office [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=265.8s)]
*  because he's not sure what to say. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=268.12s)]
*  So he has to read it all here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=269.88s)]
*  So that raises a much deeper question. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=272.12s)]
*  The question is not, is Joe Biden mentally impaired? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  Obviously he is. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=276.52s)]
*  And again, we're not going to gloat over it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=277.36s)]
*  But a much more important question for the rest of us is, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=278.64s)]
*  if he's not running the government, then who is? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=281.24s)]
*  That's a real question. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=285.12s)]
*  Clearly the FBI, the DOJ, and the military [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=287.0s)]
*  are already acting independently [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=289.88s)]
*  of the elected president of the United States. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  As you just saw, they don't even keep him informed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  of international incidents. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=295.0s)]
*  Instead, they are in some cases freelancing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  to crush anyone who opposes their power. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=300.8s)]
*  Mike Flynn, for example, he was briefly [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  the national security advisor in the Trump administration. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=306.56s)]
*  What we learned from the destruction of Mike Flynn, really, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=309.68s)]
*  was that sure, you can elect Donald Trump president, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=313.56s)]
*  but does he really run the executive branch of government? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=316.28s)]
*  No, it turned out Barack Obama was still in charge, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=318.76s)]
*  even though he was no longer president. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=321.08s)]
*  So Obama had his cronies charge Mike Flynn with a crime, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  talking to Russia as the national security advisor, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=327.44s)]
*  which of course is not a crime by any stretch, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=330.84s)]
*  and they wrecked his life for doing that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=333.64s)]
*  It took years for us, this is how slow we are, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=336.76s)]
*  to figure out exactly what had happened there, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=339.12s)]
*  but now it's very obvious. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  We just sat down with a long interview with Mike Flynn, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=341.76s)]
*  it's coming out Monday, and he told us [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=343.88s)]
*  what is really obvious to everyone who watches, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=346.08s)]
*  an unelected group within Washington [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  effectively runs the country without reference to voters. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=351.52s)]
*  Here's his assessment. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=355.56s)]
*  We have two separate governments. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=357.0s)]
*  We have the one that actually gets elected [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=359.36s)]
*  and goes into office, and then you have a government [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=361.08s)]
*  inside of Washington, D.C. that operates under no rules, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=364.4s)]
*  no authorities, other than their own [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=368.36s)]
*  or who's ever in charge of their own. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=370.36s)]
*  It sounds like that government [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=372.6s)]
*  was still controlled by Barack Obama. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=373.44s)]
*  Yeah, and I would say that that, to a degree, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  is what we're operating with today. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=378.16s)]
*  By the way, Mike Flynn is not some internet celebrity [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=382.0s)]
*  or conservative activist, he was a three-star general, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=384.8s)]
*  he was the head of an intelligence agency, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=387.48s)]
*  he was the number two guy for all American intelligence, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=389.12s)]
*  he spent his entire life working in the federal government [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=391.8s)]
*  and succeeding at that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=394.92s)]
*  So he knows what he's talking about. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=396.32s)]
*  He is a reliable guide to how the government actually works. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=397.92s)]
*  Our whole conversation with Mike Flynn, by the way, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=402.48s)]
*  is on Tucker Carlson today, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=404.0s)]
*  it's coming out Monday on Fox Nation. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  But it's not just Mike Flynn who's being destroyed. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  Every ideological opponent of the regime is under attack. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  Parents in school board meetings saying unapproved things. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=414.6s)]
*  Yesterday, Joe Biden's flack refused to rule out [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=417.68s)]
*  using the Patriot Act to hunt down American parents [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  who were upset about what their kids are learning. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=423.8s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=425.4s)]
*  Would the administration be okay [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=426.72s)]
*  with the FBI using the Patriot Act [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=429.24s)]
*  to surveil these parents if that is what they decide? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=431.08s)]
*  I don't speak on behalf [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=433.76s)]
*  of the National School Board Association, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=435.0s)]
*  I speak on behalf of this government. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=436.64s)]
*  The attorney general has put out a letter, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=438.52s)]
*  they will take actions they take [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  and I would point to them for more information. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=443.32s)]
*  Oh, so this is the spokesman for the president [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=446.48s)]
*  of the United States saying of the justice department, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=448.32s)]
*  they're gonna take actions that they're gonna take, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=449.88s)]
*  like we don't really have any control over this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=451.44s)]
*  And she may be onto something there. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=454.52s)]
*  It does increasingly seem [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=456.52s)]
*  like the national security state runs everything. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=457.92s)]
*  You remember the DOJ recently dispatched [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=461.32s)]
*  its anti-terrorism national security division [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=463.04s)]
*  to investigate ordinary parents, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=465.96s)]
*  calling them domestic terrorists. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  The DOJ is also developing training sessions [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=469.64s)]
*  to tell school board members [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=472.12s)]
*  that free speech is actually violence. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=473.44s)]
*  So who's really in charge? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=477.44s)]
*  It's a really interesting question. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=480.4s)]
*  For hottest interviews and most compelling analysis, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=487.92s)]
*  you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzvnWGY5dA&t=490.71999999999997s)]
