# Tucker: This Dr. Fauci footage is truly hilarious
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc)
*  We showed you pretty hilarious footage from a new Tony Fauci documentary last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=0.0s)]
*  It showed that Fauci knew less about science than some random people in the poorest neighborhood [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=4.8s)]
*  in D.C. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  It was truly funny. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  So today we watched more of it, and we were not disappointed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  You really should see this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=14.56s)]
*  The film crew caught Tony Fauci crying during Joe Biden's inauguration. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=16.4s)]
*  Today is a combination of so many different things. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=22.88s)]
*  It's kind of a diffusion of an incredible amount of pent-up tension and holding back [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=27.68s)]
*  of despair. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=35.28s)]
*  He was blind, but now I see. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=38.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=47.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=48.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=49.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=50.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=51.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=52.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=53.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=54.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=55.28s)]
*  Clap. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=56.28s)]
*  I'm just reassuring it is. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=57.28s)]
*  But there were other candid scenes from this documentary. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=58.44s)]
*  We cannot recommend this enough. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=61.08s)]
*  Here's Tony Fauci taking his second out of like 40 COVID shot. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  I got my second vaccine yesterday and I feel like **** today. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=69.92s)]
*  Oh, he had a vaccine reaction. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=76.88s)]
*  He must be a conspiracy theorist. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=80.32s)]
*  Clay Trappist is with Outkick.com. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=84.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=86.08s)]
*  We got to kick that man off Twitter. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=87.88s)]
*  He's claiming he had an adverse reaction to a vaccine. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=89.52s)]
*  I want this man. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=94.8s)]
*  I know everybody's focused on the Donald Trump perp walk, Tucker. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  I want Fauci in handcuffs more than I've ever wanted anyone in handcuffs in my life. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=102.0s)]
*  I never would have believed, Tucker, that after O.J. Simpson got away with double murder, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=108.88s)]
*  80 year old NIH bureaucrat would have risen to the level that Dr. Fauci has. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  But Tucker, you mentioned the guy in D.C. on the porch who questioned Fauci directly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  For two minutes, that guy on the porch questioned Fauci more aggressively on COVID than left-wing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=130.56s)]
*  media did for three years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=138.64s)]
*  One guy on the porch. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=141.72s)]
*  What I love about this documentary too is Fauci thought that he was going to be the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=143.32s)]
*  hero here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=148.32s)]
*  Instead, all it's providing now is a tangible record of all his lies, everything that he [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=149.88s)]
*  has been wrong about, immortalized forever, including some things like masking that he [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=156.82s)]
*  claims he never even said in the first place, I love it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=162.44s)]
*  I'm going to watch. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=165.56s)]
*  I want him in handcuffs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=166.56s)]
*  I think he's already in a sad, lonely hell. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=167.56s)]
*  He treats that guy like a zoo animal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=172.74s)]
*  The guy has a really good point. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=175.5s)]
*  Like, really, you can make a vaccine that fast? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=176.5s)]
*  No, we can, says Fauci. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=178.3s)]
*  And then he goes back in the car and puts on hand sanitizer because he was in that man's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=179.9s)]
*  proximity. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=184.54s)]
*  He was just dirty. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=185.54s)]
*  And how about D.C.'s mayor is there with Fauci and she says, I wouldn't even be standing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=186.54s)]
*  this close to you if I hadn't gotten my shot. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  And then I think she tested positive for COVID shortly thereafter, of course, because I guess [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=195.82s)]
*  it's going to be the seventh or eighth shot that solves it all. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=200.7s)]
*  But Fauci is a fraud. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=203.98s)]
*  Rand Paul's right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=206.22s)]
*  This guy belongs in handcuffs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=207.22s)]
*  Can we get a perp walk on this dude sooner rather than later? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=208.78s)]
*  I'm not sure I want to see any more documentaries like this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  I don't really want to know what these people are like. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=214.22s)]
*  It's always confirming of every suspicion. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  Clay Travis, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=220.3s)]
*  Thank you very much for that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=221.3s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. Appreciate it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=223.5s)]
*  And changing your life. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=231.5s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ70veTWmc&t=232.5s)]
