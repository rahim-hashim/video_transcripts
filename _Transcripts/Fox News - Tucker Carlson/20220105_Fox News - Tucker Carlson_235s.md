# Tucker: Chicago teacher battling cancer has a message as schools go remote
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8)
*  The teachers union in Chicago has voted to stop teaching students in person. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=0.0s)]
*  The union's going on strike and Chicago canceled classes today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  That's the bad news. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  But one teacher, a teacher who's battling cancer, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=10.24s)]
*  has refused to stop teaching students in person. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=12.88s)]
*  That teacher is called Joe Okul. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=16.92s)]
*  And we're honored to have him join us tonight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=18.76s)]
*  Mr. Okul, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=20.44s)]
*  Bless you for this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=24.68s)]
*  Tell us why you've made this decision. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=25.52s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=26.76s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=27.72s)]
*  Well, in the previous strikes, I already made that decision [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=28.96s)]
*  because I joined the Chicago public schools as a teacher, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=33.68s)]
*  first and foremost as a teacher. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=38.52s)]
*  And my role, I believe my role, should be inside the classroom [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=40.68s)]
*  with my students, should not be in the picket line. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  I did not join CPS to be a union member, first and foremost to be a teacher. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=48.6s)]
*  And secondly, I believe that there are ways to fight city hall. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=54.12s)]
*  You don't dangle the plight of the kids in the middle of the fight [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=60.0s)]
*  just to seek your demands. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=64.72s)]
*  There are other ways. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=67.28s)]
*  I believe there are other ways. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=68.48s)]
*  I have nothing against the union, but I have something against people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=70.88s)]
*  using the union as a tool for political gain. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=75.32s)]
*  And that's my stand. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  And that's why I feel that despite my battling cancer, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=82.0s)]
*  I still have a role to play right now and just want to make my life relevant. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Somehow the thought that I can still be of service to my students [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  and I can touch their lives and make a difference in their lives. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=103.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, you're going to make me cry. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=108.96s)]
*  So please stop. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the fact that you literally have cancer right now and you're fighting it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  and you're not afraid or you think that your duty to the students [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=116.28s)]
*  is higher than your own, the risk that you're taking on is just so inspiring, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=120.48s)]
*  I think, to the rest of us. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think it's important if you could just explain to teach them in person [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=128.28s)]
*  rather than over a Zoom app? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=132.0s)]
*  I had done the remote learning for more than a year with the students. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=134.88s)]
*  And I've seen the limitations and the challenges that a teacher faces [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=140.68s)]
*  with remote learning. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's not really effective. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=148.96s)]
*  It's not as effective as doing in-person teaching. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=150.32s)]
*  And I feel that it's not also fair to the parents. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=154.52s)]
*  The parents need to be with the students when they should be earning a living. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=160.92s)]
*  So I think that the union should look at it not in a sweeping way. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=166.28s)]
*  They did a sweeping manner on their demands. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  But there are schools without COVID. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=178.64s)]
*  I have my classroom, I have 82 students, and I'm not aware of anyone having COVID. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=181.68s)]
*  I'm not also aware of a teacher having COVID in my school. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=188.56s)]
*  So I think it's a measure of the administration coming up with ways [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=193.24s)]
*  to really ensure safety measures being observed. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=201.72s)]
*  So I think the union has to look at it on a school-to-school basis. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=206.88s)]
*  It should not be in a sweeping way, because that's not fair to the students. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=212.68s)]
*  That's not fair to the parents. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=216.36s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm so glad that you came on tonight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J77CKzyUX_8&t=222.16000000000003s)]
