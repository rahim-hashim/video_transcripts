# Balenciaga's recent campaign is 'pure evil': Brittany Aldean
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I)
*  Big protests this week across the country against Balenciaga, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=0.0s)]
*  the fashion house for promoting child sexualization [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=3.5s)]
*  in its advertisements, which it certainly did. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=7.3s)]
*  Some of its ads featured kids holding teddy bears [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=9.34s)]
*  in bondage gear. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=11.46s)]
*  It's not an accident, the CEO of Balenciaga's parent company, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=12.94s)]
*  a man called Francois Henri Pinault, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=15.76s)]
*  also owns an auction house that sold art, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=18.12s)]
*  art that sexualizes children. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Now, one of the people who was disgusted by all of this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  is Brittany Aldean. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=24.82s)]
*  She's the wife of the country singer, Jason Aldean, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=25.66s)]
*  and she joins us tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=27.38s)]
*  Brittany, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=28.7s)]
*  Hi, thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=30.580000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=31.66s)]
*  So there are, I'm not sure some of yours even know this, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=32.5s)]
*  there are actual protests against Balenciaga's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=34.54s)]
*  sexualization of children, correct? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=37.06s)]
*  Yes, there are. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  I, for one, love fashion. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=41.46s)]
*  I am super into fashion, but I refuse to represent [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=43.34s)]
*  or wear a brand that has any affiliation, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=47.7s)]
*  any affiliation with sexual exploitation of children [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=50.94s)]
*  or the sexualization of children. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=54.84s)]
*  It's disgusting, and what they showed us recently [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  in their recent campaign is pure evil. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=59.32s)]
*  Well, it is pure evil, I agree with that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=63.0s)]
*  And, you know, fashionable people sneer, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=64.76s)]
*  and oh, you're taking it too seriously, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=66.88s)]
*  and who cares, and no actual child was hurt. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=68.76s)]
*  I think it's worth taking seriously. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=72.12s)]
*  Why do you think that it is? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=73.48s)]
*  It's absolutely worth taking seriously, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  because every single detail of the photo shoot [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  was meticulously thought out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  I've been on photo shoots before, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=83.48s)]
*  I know that there are weeks of preparation, if not months. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=85.22s)]
*  This was meticulously thought out for them to think [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  that it's appropriate to put children in a situation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=91.3s)]
*  that we have seen, much less a campaign for their brand [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=93.98s)]
*  is disgusting. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  Every single prop, every single book, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=100.5s)]
*  every single teddy bear, everything was meticulously [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  thought out, regardless if they say it was a mistake or not, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  it was not a mistake. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=107.08s)]
*  They have shown us who they are, it's disgusting, it's evil. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=108.22s)]
*  And the common denominator here is that we have to stand up, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=110.94s)]
*  we have to fight for our children. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=113.7s)]
*  This is not political, this is not about religion. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=115.28s)]
*  The common denominator here is to protect the children [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=118.2s)]
*  at all costs, everybody should be outraged. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=120.88s)]
*  So nicely put, and thank you for saying that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=123.76s)]
*  about photo shoots, you've been on photo shoots. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=126.34s)]
*  So their claim that, oh, we had no idea, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=128.24s)]
*  I mean, that's totally absurd, correct? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=131.54s)]
*  It's absolutely laughable, yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=134.6s)]
*  Well, thank you for doing this, you're not embarrassed, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=137.66s)]
*  and I think it makes a difference when people are honest. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=140.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=142.74s)]
*  You are, Brady Aldean, great to see you tonight. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=143.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vn9EabcH4I&t=145.34s)]
