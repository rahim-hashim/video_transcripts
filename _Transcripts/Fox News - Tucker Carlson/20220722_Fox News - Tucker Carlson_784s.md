# Tucker Carlson: This is bizarre
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, the hallmark of any authoritarian regime [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=2.52s)]
*  is politicized justice. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=5.36s)]
*  Under that system, your opponents go to jail, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=7.36s)]
*  your supporters can do whatever they want. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=9.72s)]
*  And this reveals that the state exists [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=11.96s)]
*  not to serve the people who live in it, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=13.52s)]
*  but to preserve itself and to crush all dissent. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  I hate to think we've reached a point anywhere near that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=20.0s)]
*  here in the United States [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  because there's nothing worse than that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=23.44s)]
*  or scarier or harder to fix. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=24.92s)]
*  But in fact, we have reached that point. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=27.12s)]
*  That's where we are. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=28.62s)]
*  Yesterday, for example, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=30.12s)]
*  a man leaped on stage at a campaign event [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=31.14s)]
*  and tried to stab Lee Zeldin. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=33.34s)]
*  Zeldin's a sitting member of Congress. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  He's challenging the unelected incumbent, Kathy Hochul, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=36.74s)]
*  in the governor's race in New York. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=39.58s)]
*  So ordinarily, attempting to assassinate [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=42.18s)]
*  a federal office holder would be considered a big deal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=44.18s)]
*  But Lee Zeldin is a Republican, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=47.5s)]
*  so it's not a big deal anymore. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=48.86s)]
*  The man who tried to murder Lee Zeldin [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=50.3s)]
*  was released immediately with no bail. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=51.94s)]
*  Less than 24 hours later, by contrast, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=55.02s)]
*  former Trump advisor, Steve Bannon, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=58.12s)]
*  was convicted of crimes that until recently [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=59.62s)]
*  were not crimes at all, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=61.68s)]
*  for which he now faces a prison term of two years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=63.48s)]
*  Bannon has been declared guilty [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=67.62s)]
*  of something called contempt of Congress. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=69.08s)]
*  That may strike you as an unintentionally hilarious term [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=72.22s)]
*  since most of the time Congress invites our contempt. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=74.56s)]
*  But the point is, this is a crime [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=78.1s)]
*  that Democrats are not convicted of, ever. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Attorney General Eric Holder [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=83.8s)]
*  and IRS executive Lois Lerner [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=85.06s)]
*  were once found to be in contempt of Congress, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  both of them, and for real crimes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  In Holder's case, it was gun running in Mexico. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=91.08s)]
*  In Lerner's case, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=93.3s)]
*  it was targeting conservatives for audits. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=94.14s)]
*  But neither one went to trial. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=97.28s)]
*  Holder claimed executive privilege, which was enough, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=99.0s)]
*  even after a judge ruled that executive privilege [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=101.56s)]
*  did not apply in Eric Holder's case, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  but it didn't matter, he walked. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  Lois Lerner cited the Fifth Amendment. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=107.2s)]
*  It was as simple as that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=109.28s)]
*  Both of them, today, Lerner and Holder [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=110.8s)]
*  are free and richer than ever. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=113.56s)]
*  But these standards do not apply to Steve Bannon. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=115.96s)]
*  Steve Bannon was subpoenaed by the January 6th Committee, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=118.16s)]
*  despite the fact he had literally nothing to do [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=120.44s)]
*  with January 6th. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  And we know that because he left the White House [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  three years before it happened, but it didn't matter. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=126.6s)]
*  He annoyed the wrong people, so he's going to jail. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=129.92s)]
*  Now, this shouldn't surprise you, really, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=133.4s)]
*  because we've been building toward this moment [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=135.2s)]
*  for some time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  You might recall Greg Craig, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=138.28s)]
*  that would be Barack Obama's former White House counsel. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  He was acquitted of violating [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  the Foreign Agents Registration Act, FARA, back in 2019. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=144.92s)]
*  He'd been working for Ukraine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=149.56s)]
*  Now, at almost exactly the same moment, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=151.92s)]
*  Paul Manafort, who hired Greg Craig to work on Ukraine, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  was convicted of violating the same law, FARA, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  on the same account for Ukraine. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=163.12s)]
*  How does that work, exactly? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  It seems like a double standard. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=168.56s)]
*  And indeed, it is a double standard, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  but it's a consistent standard. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  We've seen it again and again and again. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=172.44s)]
*  Former Clinton attorney Michael Sussman [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=174.6s)]
*  was just acquitted by a DC jury [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=176.24s)]
*  of lying to the FBI, that happened in May. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=177.8s)]
*  The theory was that really, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=180.2s)]
*  who knows what Michael Sussman told the FBI [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=181.48s)]
*  about non-existent Russian servers in Trump Tower? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=187.16s)]
*  As long as we're using that theory, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=189.04s)]
*  does it work for everyone? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=190.68s)]
*  Well, it didn't work for George Papadopoulos, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=192.06s)]
*  didn't work for Michael Flynn. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=194.32s)]
*  On the other hand, neither one of those guys [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=195.68s)]
*  had a key card to FBI headquarters, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=197.28s)]
*  like Michael Sussman did. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=199.68s)]
*  And that came in handy, that relationship. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=201.44s)]
*  But Mike Flynn didn't have that relationship. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=203.96s)]
*  His life was destroyed. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=205.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=207.12s)]
*  Because of handwritten notes by Peter Strzok, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=208.0s)]
*  who you can now see on MSNBC, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=210.24s)]
*  about their conversation in the White House [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=212.48s)]
*  about Russian sanctions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=214.52s)]
*  Get him to lie, the head of counterintelligence [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=216.84s)]
*  at the FBI wrote to Strzok, speaking of Flynn. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=219.92s)]
*  So on the basis of that, the setup, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=223.64s)]
*  they hounded Mike Flynn into poverty. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=226.64s)]
*  The same thing happened at George Papadopoulos. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=229.94s)]
*  Papadopoulos' crime, not being as forthcoming as possible [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=232.3s)]
*  about his job status with the Trump campaign, unpaid. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=235.8s)]
*  That's literally what the DOJ told the court in a filing, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=240.22s)]
*  quote, the defendant did not provide substantial assistance. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=242.54s)]
*  Oh, that's the standard. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=247.26s)]
*  So Papadopoulos went to prison. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=249.42s)]
*  So did the 69 year old grandmother recently, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=251.86s)]
*  called Pam Hemphill. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=254.66s)]
*  She's currently serving a two month sentence [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=255.92s)]
*  in federal prison. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=257.42s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=258.26s)]
*  She, quote, paraded in the Capitol on January 6th, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=259.08s)]
*  didn't hurt anyone. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  She's got breast cancer, she's going to prison. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=263.4s)]
*  A judge in Washington had no problem issuing that sentence [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=266.32s)]
*  at exactly the same moment the US attorney for DC [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=269.0s)]
*  dropped all charges against Stephen Colbert's production crew [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=272.24s)]
*  for doing the same thing, but worse. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  So Stephen Colbert's team may have lied [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=279.24s)]
*  to federal authorities when they said [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  they'd stayed in restricted areas, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  but they didn't lie to federal authorities [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=284.02s)]
*  in quite the same way, apparently. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=285.68s)]
*  And of course they had the right politics. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=289.28s)]
*  Unlike Roger Stone, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=291.32s)]
*  Roger Stone got a three year prison sentence. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  He had a SWAT team show up at his house at dawn [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=295.84s)]
*  with a CNN crew in tow, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  tipped off by the justice department [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=300.08s)]
*  for maximum humiliation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  What was his crime? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=303.44s)]
*  No one can remember, cause there wasn't one. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=304.26s)]
*  So if you've been paying any attention at all [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=307.56s)]
*  to our justice system, particularly under Merrick Garland, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=309.84s)]
*  you had some sense of where this was going. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  It was moving toward the authoritarian system we now have, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=316.36s)]
*  where justice is an illusion. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=318.92s)]
*  Offend the people in charge, get punished. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=320.54s)]
*  Support the people in charge, do whatever you want. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  Still, even knowing that, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=325.76s)]
*  today's conviction of Steve Bannon is an escalation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=327.44s)]
*  There was not even a pretense in his trial [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=330.88s)]
*  that the prosecution of Steve Bannon was lawful. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  So the constitution requires equal protection. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=336.36s)]
*  Heard that phrase? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=338.22s)]
*  That means that selective prosecution is not allowed. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=339.48s)]
*  It's unconstitutional. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  If you don't try one person for a crime, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  you don't get to charge another person for the same crime [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=346.24s)]
*  cause that's selective, it's political. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=349.88s)]
*  But under Merrick Garland, that's the new rule. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=352.74s)]
*  Offend us, go to jail. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=355.58s)]
*  At his trial, Steve Bannon was not permitted to say [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=358.2s)]
*  that his attorneys had counseled him [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=360.24s)]
*  against bending the knee of the January 6th committee. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  He couldn't even say that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=363.64s)]
*  Nor was he allowed to argue [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=365.02s)]
*  that his subpoena was legally invalid. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=366.3s)]
*  Why couldn't he argue that? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  All Steve Bannon was allowed to do was shut up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=370.28s)]
*  He had to remain silent and await his conviction. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=372.94s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=375.16s)]
*  Outside of federal court today, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  Steve Bannon pointed out that he subpoenaed members [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  of the January 6th committee to testify at his trial. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=380.76000000000005s)]
*  Why can't you face your accusers? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=385.3s)]
*  Isn't that guaranteed under our system? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Not in this case. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=389.44000000000005s)]
*  Because having the January 6th committee members show up [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=391.24s)]
*  would expose them to the one thing they cannot tolerate, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=395.24s)]
*  which is cross-examination. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  So they refused, watch. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  I want to thank the jury for what the effort they did. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=402.7s)]
*  The judge, particularly the court administration here, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=405.18s)]
*  everybody, I only have one disappointment. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=407.46s)]
*  And that is the gutless members of that show trial committee. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=409.86s)]
*  The J-6 committee didn't have the guts [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=413.97999999999996s)]
*  to come down here and testify and open court. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=416.78s)]
*  Did you expect Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger to show up? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=420.74s)]
*  They don't have to testify. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  They don't have to do anything they don't want to do. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  They can just send their enemies to jail. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=431.54s)]
*  So their behavior is really not that surprising [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=433.5s)]
*  because the January 6th committee itself [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=436.20000000000005s)]
*  does not allow cross-examination during its hearings. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=438.86s)]
*  You may have noticed this. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=442.3s)]
*  It doesn't even allow the identification of many witnesses. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  They do it anonymously. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=446.02000000000004s)]
*  How do you define show trial? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  That's how you define show trial. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=448.98s)]
*  So these are not hearings in any recognizable sense. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=451.32000000000005s)]
*  This is a show trial. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=457.54s)]
*  That is exactly what it is. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=458.90000000000003s)]
*  That's not overstatement. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=461.06s)]
*  The committee did not allow the cross-examination [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=462.82s)]
*  of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, for example. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=464.86s)]
*  Even after she made claims that were insane, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=467.74s)]
*  they made no sense. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=470.22s)]
*  She claimed that Donald Trump tried to carjack [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=471.22s)]
*  his own presidential limo and drive it to the Capitol. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=473.16s)]
*  So if she'd been cross-examined, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  which in any hearing, hearing is permitted [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=478.78s)]
*  under the Western system of justice, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=482.02s)]
*  not the woke system of justice [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=484.66s)]
*  that Liz Cheney has brought us, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=486.94s)]
*  but the conventional system that all of us grew up with, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=488.52s)]
*  you would have a cross-examination [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=491.53999999999996s)]
*  and someone might've pointed out [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=493.08s)]
*  that the Secret Service agents in that limo [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=494.29999999999995s)]
*  denied her account. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=496.4s)]
*  But if you were watching on MSNBC or CNN, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=498.68s)]
*  which have taken this propaganda live [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=501.24s)]
*  and then bragged about it, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=503.28s)]
*  we're doing the bidding of the state. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=505.26s)]
*  We're so proud. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=506.52s)]
*  We're calling it journalism. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  We've refused to do that because we have dignity [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=509.32s)]
*  and we're not liars unlike them. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=511.56s)]
*  But if you're watching this on those channels, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  you would have no idea [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=515.46s)]
*  that the Secret Service denied this account. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=517.6s)]
*  The Secret Service was never contacted [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  by Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger before the testimony. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's bizarre. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=525.6s)]
*  Because if the committee wanted to get to the truth [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=527.64s)]
*  of the Trump grabbed the wheel of the limo allegation, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=529.78s)]
*  they would have talked to people who were there, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=532.26s)]
*  but they didn't. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=533.4s)]
*  Republicans, if they'd been allowed to cross-examine, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=535.6s)]
*  if they demanded to cross-examine, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=538.36s)]
*  we're not defending Republicans. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=540.2s)]
*  They've fallen down on the job. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=541.44s)]
*  That's an understatement. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=542.44s)]
*  But if someone had been allowed to ask adult questions [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  of the witness, we might have learned [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=548.8399999999999s)]
*  what CNN viewers will never know. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=551.6s)]
*  And that's that Hutchinson reportedly tried to get a job [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=553.28s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago afterward. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=555.56s)]
*  But none of that was allowed. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=558.12s)]
*  Because it's pure propaganda. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  This has been going on for months now. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=562.8s)]
*  Last night, the January 6th committee put on testimony [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=564.12s)]
*  from an anonymous official. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=566.4s)]
*  Can you imagine an anonymous official [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  claiming that Secret Service agents assigned to Mike Pence [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=571.1s)]
*  were using their radios to tell their families goodbye, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=573.92s)]
*  like they were on the deck of the Titanic? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=576.16s)]
*  Because they assumed they would die in the Capitol [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  because some guy in Viking horns on mushrooms [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=579.8s)]
*  was spinning in rounded circles and talking about peace. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=582.76s)]
*  They were so afraid. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=586.92s)]
*  Watch this nonsense. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=588.92s)]
*  The members of the VP detail at this time [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=591.12s)]
*  were starting to fear for their own lives. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=593.04s)]
*  There were a lot of, there was a lot of yelling, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=596.0s)]
*  a lot of, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=598.88s)]
*  a lot of very personal calls over the radio. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=600.12s)]
*  So, it was disturbing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=603.84s)]
*  I don't like talking about it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=607.84s)]
*  But there were calls to say goodbye to family members, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=609.1600000000001s)]
*  so on and so forth. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  It was getting, for whatever reason was on the ground, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=615.0s)]
*  the VP detail thought that this was about to get very ugly. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  It's just absolutely shameful, absolutely shameful [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=621.1600000000001s)]
*  that the other channels played this nonsense. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=625.2s)]
*  That the other channels played this crap [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=628.24s)]
*  without pushing back in even the mildest way. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=631.6s)]
*  Oh, it's news. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=635.2s)]
*  It's not news. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=636.12s)]
*  And your job in journalism [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=637.24s)]
*  is to hold the powerful accountable. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=638.88s)]
*  It's not to do their bidding [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=641.6s)]
*  or put their lies on TV unedited in prime time, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=642.88s)]
*  which is what every other channel has done, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=646.48s)]
*  except Fox News, and we are proud of that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=648.36s)]
*  Well, you should be ashamed. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=650.64s)]
*  Yeah, you should be ashamed. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=651.76s)]
*  But there was no cross-examination allowed in any of this [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=654.28s)]
*  because this committee would not allow it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=656.96s)]
*  No rebuttal of any kind. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=658.6800000000001s)]
*  So of course there was no inquiry [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=661.1600000000001s)]
*  as to why a Capitol Hill police officer [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=662.64s)]
*  with a documented history [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=665.12s)]
*  of recklessly mishandling firearms [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=666.52s)]
*  shot an unarmed woman in the neck, an Air Force veteran. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=668.6s)]
*  He shot her in the neck. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=674.32s)]
*  You're not allowed to ask. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  What happened to those thousands of hours [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=677.52s)]
*  of surveillance footage? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  Why can't we see those? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=681.12s)]
*  Nah, you're not allowed even to ask [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=682.36s)]
*  why we're not allowed to see them. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=684.12s)]
*  We can't know why police are on video [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=687.2s)]
*  letting people into the Capitol complex on January 6th. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=689.64s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=694.9200000000001s)]
*  Not allowed to ask. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=696.6s)]
*  And this is gonna continue. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=699.1600000000001s)]
*  As Adam Kinzinger said, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=700.4000000000001s)]
*  this charade, which really does corrode the heart [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=701.96s)]
*  of our system, this will continue [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  all the way till the midterms [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=712.4000000000001s)]
*  because as Kinzinger, who's dumb enough [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=713.6s)]
*  to say the quiet part out loud, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=715.28s)]
*  admitted this is a political exercise. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=716.9599999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  This investigation is not winding down. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=720.24s)]
*  We may be towards the end of this tranche of hearings. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  We may have more hearings in the future [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=725.68s)]
*  and the investigation is still ongoing. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=727.8s)]
*  So we're getting to the bottom of what we need to know. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=730.28s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=734.4399999999999s)]
*  We're getting to the bottom. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=735.28s)]
*  Actually, you're preventing legitimate, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=736.16s)]
*  obvious questions from being asked. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=738.92s)]
*  And just in point of fact, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=741.24s)]
*  no matter how long these hearings go on, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  they could go on forever [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  and Adam Kinzinger will still be a sad, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=746.5999999999999s)]
*  tormented tiny man with a miserable personal life. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=749.24s)]
*  So, you know, that's some comfort. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=751.9599999999999s)]
*  But the prosecutors here working for Kinzinger [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=754.98s)]
*  and Cheney and the rest of this committee, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  just like the school boards [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=759.68s)]
*  and the teachers unions last year, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=760.64s)]
*  worked in tandem with the Justice Department [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=762.16s)]
*  to punish the enemies of the Democratic Party. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=764.9599999999999s)]
*  What is that? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=768.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's the single greatest threat to the rule of law [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  in the history of the United States. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApfU152awvw&t=771.1999999999999s)]
