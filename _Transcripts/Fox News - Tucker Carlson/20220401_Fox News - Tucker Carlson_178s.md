# Disney employee running for Congress speaks out on parental rights bill
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk)
*  State of Florida has just banned teachers from talking to kindergartners about their genitals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=0.0s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of Americans support this because talking to kindergartners about their genitals, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=6.0s)]
*  if you're not their parents, is a sex crime. You are a sex criminal if you do that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=11.0s)]
*  But executives at the Walt Disney Corporation are panicked by this. They're so upset they've decided to ban the words [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=16.0s)]
*  boy and girl from theme parks. But those executives do not speak for all Disney employees, we are happy to tell you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=22.0s)]
*  Jose Castillo, for example, is a current employee at Disney. He's running for Congress in Florida's 9th Congressional District, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=29.0s)]
*  which includes Orlando, and we're happy to have him join us tonight. Mr. Castillo, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=35.0s)]
*  So you work at Disney now, you're brave to do the show, I have to say. What is your view of Disney's support of talking to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=40.0s)]
*  kindergartners about their genitals? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=47.0s)]
*  Well, first, thank you, Ketaka, for having me on the show. I'll say this first, you know, I don't speak for the Walt Disney Company, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=49.0s)]
*  but it's very evident that the Walt Disney Company does not speak for me or for the silent majority of Disney customers who support this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=55.0s)]
*  So, as a matter of fact, we're lucky to have someone like Governor DeSantis in Tallahassee that is speaking for us, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=61.0s)]
*  and that's what I'm hoping to do, to go speak for the silent majority of Disney customers. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=66.0s)]
*  You know, my phone's been off the hook. I've been getting emails, messages on social media from Disney customers from all walks of life, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=70.0s)]
*  all lines of business telling me thank you for standing up. We feel like we don't have a voice, and we're glad you're doing this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=77.0s)]
*  So, thank you, Ketaka, for the opportunity. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=84.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, people trust Disney with their children, and a lot of people who work at Disney are good people like you, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=86.0s)]
*  and I'm sure most of your coworkers. So to sexualize children is really a betrayal of the trust that people have in Disney, and it's scary. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=92.0s)]
*  What's your sense as you campaign in the congressional district around Orlando of how voters feel about this? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=101.0s)]
*  Well, firstly, I think there's a huge misconception that everyone here in central Florida and Disney are raging liberals, and we're not. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=109.0s)]
*  The problem is that we're a silent majority, the small minority that's very vocal. There's this saying, squeaky wheel gets the grease, and that's what's happening. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=116.0s)]
*  You know, this is a company, they're basically, they're capitalists, right? So they're listening, but they're listening to the people that are more vocal, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=124.0s)]
*  and the silent majority, us, we need to be more vocal, we need to stand up, and that's why I'm here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=130.0s)]
*  That's why I hope to go to do in Washington, stand up for the people, for conservative values. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=134.0s)]
*  Boy, I sure hope you make it, because what you're saying is totally sensible, it's in line with what most people think. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=139.0s)]
*  So that would be a victory for democracy. Jose Castillo, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=145.0s)]
*  Tucker, you said that I was courageous for being here. A lot of people said that, you know, I'm afraid of losing my job. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=149.0s)]
*  I'm not afraid of losing my job. I'm afraid of losing my country. So, you know, that's why I'm here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=155.0s)]
*  I'm running to be the next United States representative for the people of Central Florida. Thank you for the opportunity, Tucker. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=159.0s)]
*  Amen. I hope I see your swearing in. Thank you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JyoqJFMGk&t=164.0s)]
