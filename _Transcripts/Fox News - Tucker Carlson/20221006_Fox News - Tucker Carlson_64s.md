**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w)
*  It's amazing what the stakes are when a very famous person decides to speak his mind. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=0.0s)]
*  Very famous people can't have free speech. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=4.64s)]
*  That's not allowed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=7.08s)]
*  And West discovered that when he initially decided he kind of liked Donald Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=8.68s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=12.88s)]
*  I never actually told people that I liked Trump when he was running because I was bullied [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  by Hollywood. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=23.44s)]
*  Because I stayed in Hollywood and people like think about your kids and I'm trying to hold [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=25.84s)]
*  on to the marriage. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=30.38s)]
*  So I'm just biting my tongue. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=31.88s)]
*  Like there's so many fathers and mothers that go to work every day and they're in a situation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  where they're biting their tongue because they think it would be better for their children. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=40.16s)]
*  So even me in my position, I was biting my tongue on my political opinion because I thought [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  it would be better for my children. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xM_42CG13w&t=51.72s)]
