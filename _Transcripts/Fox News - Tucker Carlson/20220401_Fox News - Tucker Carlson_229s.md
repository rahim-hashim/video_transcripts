# We just can't stop beating the drum of racism: Carolla
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY)
*  Well, the NFL has just decreed that ahead of the 2022 season, all teams in the league must hire an offensive coach who is, quote, a female or a member of a racial or ethnic minority. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=0.0s)]
*  NFL did not define the word female or even define the term racial minority, since the majority of players in the NFL are black. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=10.0s)]
*  But they're the only big player in American entertainment that has a new set of quotas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=17.96s)]
*  The Oscars says it will disqualify any film that doesn't have enough, quote, black, gay or disabled actors by 2024. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=23.12s)]
*  By the way, if that policy had been in effect last year, it would have disqualified the Best Picture winner this year. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=29.56s)]
*  Adam Carolla is a comedian and author and lifelong resident of the state of California, where a lot of these decisions are made. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  And he joins us in studio. Adam, it's great to see you. I can't come to L.A. without seeing you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=41.4s)]
*  What put this together? What are we what are we looking at here? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=45.48s)]
*  Well, it's a constant obsession in 2022 of a problem that has essentially been solved years ago. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=49.12s)]
*  And it's hurting the country, obviously, to keep talking about this thing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=58.92s)]
*  It's like when Jaws came out. Remember when Jaws came out? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=64.24s)]
*  No one wanted to go in the ocean because they thought they were going to. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=67.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=71.28s)]
*  Except for statistically, it doesn't exist. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=71.6s)]
*  That's essentially what we're doing with racism. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=74.28s)]
*  We just keep beating it and beating it and beating the drum. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=76.64s)]
*  And we used to be bring us the best and the brightest. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  And now it's bring us the least whitest. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=83.56s)]
*  So, I mean, it seems like the NFL would be maybe one of the last places you'd want to bring this up since it's over 65 percent black. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=87.12s)]
*  I don't know anyone who has a problem with that. We assume it's a meritocracy. I think it is. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=96.2s)]
*  It's why people love sports. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the Rams, my Rams won the Super Bowl. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=102.08s)]
*  I think, you know, 10 out of 11 guys on the defensive side of the ball were black. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=105.16s)]
*  And I assume that's because of the best players the Rams can put on the field. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=110.32s)]
*  I assume that too. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=114.64s)]
*  Anyway, I like it. And I cheer. It's hard for everybody because I'm cheering for the Rams like I'm cheering for this country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=115.68s)]
*  Well, kind of a weird industry to introduce quotas like this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=122.28s)]
*  And it's also super unfair to the people because whether it's a student on the campus of Harvard or the first bi, gay, lesbian, black, you know, female assistant coach, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  Everyone is looking at her. She may be incredibly qualified, but people are going to think she's only there because of this quota system. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=140.8s)]
*  So at what point? I mean, my theory in recent weeks has been this is too nuts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  Too few people are benefiting from it is going to end. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  Like, when does this revolution burn itself out? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  I think we're hitting some sort of saturation critical mass point, although I say that every four months and then they go crazier. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=158.96s)]
*  But it's also really insidious. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  Like, you know, when the politicians get up there and they go, we need a fire captain that represents the community that he or she is like, no, you don't. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=170.0s)]
*  You need a good fire captain. Right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  It's racist to think that he would only help people who look like him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, when they get up there and they do that, scared of people who look different than you, that's insidious that you couldn't get along in this country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=186.92s)]
*  If that was your mindset. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=194.83999999999997s)]
*  Do you know anyone who feels that way? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you've lived in this country for over 50 years. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=197.88s)]
*  Bill Mollusian is the only guy I know. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  What a good man, Bill Mollusian. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=202.92s)]
*  But he's got the best hair on TV. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=204.68s)]
*  So I got to bring him down a peg. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=206.56s)]
*  The makeup artist says it's entirely real. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=208.92s)]
*  Adam Kroll, it's great to see you still in California. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=211.96s)]
*  If you ever leave, we'll do an hour long special on your departure. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIhrDDpyDY&t=214.56s)]
