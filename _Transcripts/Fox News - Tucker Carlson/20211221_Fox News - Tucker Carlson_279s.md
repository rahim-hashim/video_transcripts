# 'Naughty Nancy' at it again: Masters
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs)
*  Nancy Pelosi's been in politics longer than a lot of people watching this show right now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=0.0s)]
*  have been alive and somehow she will end up super rich. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=4.14s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=7.18s)]
*  She's now one of the wealthiest members of Congress. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=8.18s)]
*  And just last year, apparently, Pelosi's personal wealth grew by almost $17 million. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=10.36s)]
*  Did yours? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=15.14s)]
*  Actually, millions of Americans were forced into poverty by the corona lockdown she supported. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=16.14s)]
*  So why are members of Congress allowed to trade in markets that they effectively regulate? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=21.16s)]
*  We don't know, but we know for a fact that Nancy Pelosi wants to continue doing it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=27.1s)]
*  She's defending it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Madam Speaker, Insider just completed a five-month investigation finding that 49 members of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Congress and 182 senior congressional staffers have violated the stock act, the Insider Dream [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=40.46s)]
*  Law. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=45.82s)]
*  I'm wondering if you have any reaction to that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=46.82s)]
*  And secondly, should members of Congress and their spouses be banned from trading individual [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=48.44s)]
*  stocks while serving in Congress? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=53.3s)]
*  No, I don't know to the second one. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=55.06s)]
*  We have a responsibility to report on the stock, but I'm not familiar with that five-month [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=59.18000000000001s)]
*  review. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=66.10000000000001s)]
*  But if people aren't reporting, they should be. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=67.44s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  Because this is a free market and people, we have a free market economy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=71.86s)]
*  They should be able to participate in that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=78.22s)]
*  We don't have a free market economy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=80.30000000000001s)]
*  This is not a free market. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=83.26s)]
*  He's Insider Trading. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=84.5s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=85.5s)]
*  Blake Master cares. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=86.5s)]
*  He's running for Senate in the state of Arizona. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=87.5s)]
*  He's come out against this, promises to end it if elected. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=89.86s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=92.18s)]
*  Blake Masters, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=93.18s)]
*  How can this continue? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=95.5s)]
*  Well, Tucker, it can't. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  I mean, naughty Nancy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=99.86s)]
*  My goodness. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=101.62s)]
*  She's at it again. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=102.7s)]
*  Trading stocks, breaking laws. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=103.7s)]
*  Tucker, I think Nancy Pelosi is the poster child for the rot and corruption in our politics. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=105.62s)]
*  She uses her high office to enrich herself, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=111.98s)]
*  Her husband, they make tens of millions of dollars every year trading stocks. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=115.5s)]
*  Look at her record. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=120.3s)]
*  She's outperforming Warren Buffett. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=121.3s)]
*  She's the best investor in the world. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=123.14s)]
*  And how does that happen? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=125.22s)]
*  Could it be because she has non-public information about these companies? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=126.22s)]
*  I mean, this is disgusting. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=131.18s)]
*  And I don't think we can trust these people to regulate themselves. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=132.96s)]
*  We can't trust them to police themselves. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=135.7s)]
*  And so we just have to ban it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=137.82s)]
*  We need to ban individual Congress members from owning and trading stocks. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=139.38s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=144.46s)]
*  Well, it kind of is that simple. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=145.46s)]
*  And if you're Nancy Pelosi and you're already one of the richest people in the country and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=147.78s)]
*  you're Speaker of the House at the age of 81, what's kind of the point? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=151.66s)]
*  I mean, why wouldn't she just stop doing this voluntarily? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=155.5s)]
*  What does that tell us about her? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=158.1s)]
*  Well, it tells us that she's really corrupt. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=159.82s)]
*  And unfortunately, the problem goes so far deeper, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=162.92s)]
*  It's not just Pelosi. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=166.38s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=167.38s)]
*  They're corrupt and they're hypocritical, so much so that there are terms for this, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=169.38s)]
*  right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=173.18s)]
*  Champagne socialist, limousine liberal. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=174.18s)]
*  Look at Elizabeth Warren, who's in the news this week for attacking our country's richest [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=176.06s)]
*  African-American entrepreneur, a successful businessman who's on track to pay $12 billion [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=181.42s)]
*  in taxes this year. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=188.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=189.3s)]
*  I'm talking about Elon Musk, of course. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=190.3s)]
*  And Elon has done more this week for America than Elizabeth Warren will do in her lifetime. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=192.16s)]
*  And she has the nerve to criticize him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=198.26s)]
*  So I'm just sick and tired of this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=200.18s)]
*  And if you're sick and tired of it, you're watching at home, you're sick and tired of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=201.66s)]
*  the corruption in DC, help send me into the U.S. Senate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=204.66s)]
*  Go to blakemasters.com, donate as much as you can to my campaign. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  I promise you, I will put an end to this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=211.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=214.18s)]
*  I mean, really quick, I mean, if she's getting better returns than Warren Buffett is, is [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=215.18s)]
*  there some way for the rest of us to benefit from her stock picking prowess? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=219.5s)]
*  I mean, she's a savant, obviously. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=223.06s)]
*  She seems like she's got dementia. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=225.26s)]
*  But no, how can we get, how can she become our CNBC anchor? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=227.74s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=232.06s)]
*  Well, we do need to retire her from her job. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=234.06s)]
*  I mean, she's been in office forever. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=237.62s)]
*  We need term limits. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=239.74s)]
*  We need a new changing of the guard. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=240.74s)]
*  These people are just so corrupt. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=242.5s)]
*  And Tucker, I'm just so sick of it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=244.46s)]
*  Merry Christmas to everybody watching, except you, Noddy Nancy, a lump of coal for you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=245.82s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=251.06s)]
*  She's our Jim Cramer. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=252.54s)]
*  Blake Masters running for the United States Senate in the state of Arizona. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  A lot of people didn't think it was in within reach of Republicans. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=257.82s)]
*  The polling is suggesting it is. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=260.94s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=262.94s)]
*  We're rooting for you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxpnWrywKs&t=263.94s)]
