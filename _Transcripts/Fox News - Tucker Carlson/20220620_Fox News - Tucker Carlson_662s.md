# Tucker Carlson: We are scarred by what we saw
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, happy Monday, if you could call it that, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=2.58s)]
*  but you can't, like most Americans, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=5.4s)]
*  you're probably still trying to digest [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=6.98s)]
*  what has happened over these past four days. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=8.86s)]
*  Profound national trauma is like that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=11.14s)]
*  Once you face something unimaginably horrible, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=13.26s)]
*  nothing is ever the same. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=16.98s)]
*  Nothing will ever be the same. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=18.04s)]
*  Like prison, it changes a man. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=19.28s)]
*  This is not an easy time for any of us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  We get it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=23.1s)]
*  We're literally, literally still shaking [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=24.18s)]
*  as we think about how close this country came [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=28.0s)]
*  to losing our democracy last Thursday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=29.82s)]
*  Last Thursday was June 16th, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=32.62s)]
*  a day forever branded in our memory, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=35.26s)]
*  a day that has joined the pantheon [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=37.42s)]
*  of tragic turning points in human history. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=39.3s)]
*  Where were you on 616? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=41.54s)]
*  You'll never forget, and neither will we. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=43.06s)]
*  At the time, we were preparing a show on Tony Fauci [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  and his push for a new Corona shot for kids. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=48.46s)]
*  It seemed important then. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=51.04s)]
*  It seems so trivial now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  As we were speaking on there, at that very moment, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=54.06s)]
*  a team of seven saboteurs had entered the Capitol grounds [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=56.62s)]
*  and then proceeded, as saboteurs do, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=60.82s)]
*  to breach the Capitol itself. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=62.94s)]
*  Inside those hallowed grounds, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=65.28s)]
*  within the very womb of democracy, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=66.7s)]
*  these wreckers began their hunt [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=69.62s)]
*  for sitting members of Congress. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=71.42s)]
*  That happened, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=73.08s)]
*  and if it sounds shocking to you, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=74.86s)]
*  it gets more harrowing from there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=76.58s)]
*  This was not some spontaneous outbreak of insurrection. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=78.46s)]
*  No, this was a meticulously planned coup from afar. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=81.9s)]
*  The group in the Capitol was under the direct control [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=88.98s)]
*  of an extremist called Stephen Colbert, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=92.02s)]
*  who was a white man, is by definition a white extremist. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=94.74s)]
*  This white extremist, Stephen Colbert, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  had a fifth column within the Capitol [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=100.58s)]
*  to help him pull off his diabolical plan. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=102.9s)]
*  He had members of Congress in his employ, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=105.66s)]
*  members of Congress who, believe it or not, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=108.62s)]
*  helped the insurrectionists enter the Capitol. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=110.78s)]
*  Just open the doors and let them walk in. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=113.62s)]
*  Yes, that can happen. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=116.9s)]
*  And that fifth column included Adam Schiff of California, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=118.74s)]
*  Stephanie Murphy of Florida, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=121.54s)]
*  and a new member called Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=123.76s)]
*  besmirching his family name. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=127.5s)]
*  Those three members of Congress allowed the wreckers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=129.7s)]
*  inside the Longworth House Office Building, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  while inside the insurrectionists tried to gain access [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=135.74s)]
*  to a restricted area. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=138.5s)]
*  But they were thwarted by brave law enforcement who arrived, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=141.54s)]
*  risking their very lives to remove the insurrectionists [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=144.7s)]
*  from the premises. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=147.7s)]
*  But it wasn't enough, because hours later, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=149.26s)]
*  an aide to Congressman Auchincloss [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  secretly permitted the insurrectionists [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=154.34s)]
*  to reenter the Capitol complex. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=156.26s)]
*  And then around 8.30 PM, they caused some kind [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=158.5s)]
*  of disturbance that the details are murky as of tonight. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  But according to one report, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  they were banging on windows inside the Capitol, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=164.7s)]
*  trashing the place, committing violence against our democracy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=167.54s)]
*  And for that, apparently, we are hearing tonight, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=173.1s)]
*  they were put in jail, but within hours they were out again. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=177.38s)]
*  Now, the man who controlled this attempted to coup, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=182.04s)]
*  Stephen Colbert, knew exactly what he was doing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=185.42s)]
*  He knew the stakes, he knew the crimes he was committing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=187.98s)]
*  And we know that because just last year, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=191.54s)]
*  this white extremist, Stephen Colbert, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=194.04s)]
*  explained that grown men who unlawfully entered the Capitol [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=197.34s)]
*  to harass sitting members of Congress are not pranksters, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=201.18s)]
*  they're not protesters, they're domestic terrorists. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=205.5s)]
*  Lord have mercy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=209.82s)]
*  There are some dark subjects that we talk about [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=212.04s)]
*  on the show occasionally, but I've rarely been as upset [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=215.62s)]
*  as I am tonight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=220.06s)]
*  This is the most shocking, most tragic, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=221.62s)]
*  least surprising thing I've ever seen. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=224.3s)]
*  And his followers did what he told them to do, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=227.1s)]
*  behave in a way that's, what's the word, deplorable. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=230.18s)]
*  One of these domestic terrorists [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=234.54s)]
*  even broke into Speaker Pelosi's office [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=236.5s)]
*  and put his feet up on her desk. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=238.84s)]
*  They now live in an alternate universe [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  that is now collapsing in on itself. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=243.1s)]
*  It's like a black hole of whiteness. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=245.18s)]
*  And this was never some sort of peaceful protest, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=248.7s)]
*  this was Charlottesville come home to roost. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=250.86s)]
*  Oh, it's shocking. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=255.08s)]
*  These are domestic terrorists. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=258.36s)]
*  Stephen Colbert, in what the literary community refers to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=261.68s)]
*  as foreshadowing, described his own coup. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=266.12s)]
*  And yet Stephen Colbert somehow still has access [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=271.2s)]
*  to the airwaves and to digital media, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=274.92s)]
*  spreading his hate unfettered, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=277.56s)]
*  convincing future generations of insurrections [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  to do what his team of saboteurs did last week. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=283.16s)]
*  That must stop. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  People who plan coups must be silenced. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  There's recent precedent for that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=291.32000000000005s)]
*  And anyone who disagrees should be disconnected [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=293.24s)]
*  from Amazon Web Services immediately. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  No spreading hate. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=298.92s)]
*  But stopping white extremist Stephen Colbert [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=301.88s)]
*  from passing on his message of insurrection to the country [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  won't solve what the rest of us are living with. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's trauma. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=312.02s)]
*  And like all trauma, journalists are affected most profoundly. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=313.9s)]
*  We're scarred by what we saw. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=319.5s)]
*  We're all Casey Hunt tonight. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=321.02s)]
*  It'll be a long time before we can revisit [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  the Capitol building, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  before we can forget where we were when democracy shook [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=325.84s)]
*  on its very foundations. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=329.0s)]
*  It's gonna take therapy, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=330.74s)]
*  it's gonna take a lot of support from our fellow survivors [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  before we can recapture the carefree innocence [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  that Stephen Colbert stole from us, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=337.24s)]
*  before we can feel safe again. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=338.88s)]
*  We're not alone in our despair tonight. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=340.92s)]
*  Lies that would bring thousands of angry people [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=343.36s)]
*  to the Capitol for one of America's darkest days. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=345.2s)]
*  Became one of the darkest days [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=347.36s)]

*  But we do, we do feel. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=380.5s)]
*  You see something like that, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=382.96s)]
*  you see an insurrection take place before your very eyes, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=384.97999999999996s)]

*  See, I just interviewed a Rolling Stone journalist [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=396.5s)]
*  who after a year and a half, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=398.74s)]

*  Watch. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=404.22s)]
*  Grace, you wrote for Poynter in January, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=405.62s)]
*  the last year you said, sometimes I'm fine. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=407.7s)]
*  Sometimes I wanna sob for hours. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=410.04s)]
*  Sometimes I just wanna sleep. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=412.18s)]
*  So that sounds to me like trauma. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=414.06s)]
*  That sounds like PTSD. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=415.92s)]

*  I do think so, to a certain extent. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=421.58s)]
*  This morning when I got on the train [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  to come down here and see you, Brian, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  I was looking at the Capitol Dome. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=427.52s)]
*  And my parents recently came down to visit me [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=429.24s)]
*  and we were near it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  And I remember thinking to myself, man, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=433.32s)]
*  I can't wait until I can look at this and not feel sad. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=435.76s)]
*  Now you look at something like that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=440.44s)]
*  and you're tempted to dismiss it out of hand. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=441.79999999999995s)]
*  Oh, you're having trouble sleeping, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=444.12s)]
*  you sob for no reason, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=446.02s)]
*  well, that's because you have a barren personal life. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=447.28s)]
*  You're celibate, your only meaningful human contact [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=450.2s)]
*  comes from the Uber Eats guy. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=452.76s)]
*  You live out your emotional life on Netflix. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=454.35999999999996s)]
*  That's your core problem. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=456.64s)]
*  It couldn't really be an insurrection that made you cry. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=457.64s)]
*  Sorry, excuse me, sorry, stop. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=461.0s)]
*  Or disrupted your sleep, but it can. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=464.08s)]
*  For a journalist, this stuff hurts. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=468.52s)]
*  But if you think it's bad for us in the news media, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=471.82s)]
*  what do you think it was like for the lawmakers [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  who were trapped inside Thursday night? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=477.68s)]
*  In the last insurrection, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=480.86s)]
*  even though she was nowhere near the Capitol, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=482.06s)]
*  she was probably getting her nails done, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=484.56s)]
*  but it didn't matter, Sandy Cortez nearly died. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=485.44s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=489.44s)]
*  has given a harrowing account of her experience [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=492.0s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=494.44s)]
*  A harrowing, an emotional account of what happened to her [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  during the Capitol riot. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  It's one of the most harrowing accounts so far. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=499.23999999999995s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=502.79999999999995s)]
*  tell that harrowing story. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=504.84s)]
*  The harrowing story of how she hid from attackers [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=506.28s)]
*  during the Capitol riot. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=508.84s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=510.28s)]
*  Disclosing new harrowing details. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=513.08s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=517.12s)]
*  That's what an insurrection looks like. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  But there's no charade-like miming [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=523.5200000000001s)]
*  that can ever fully express the pain inside. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=528.6s)]
*  We're gonna deal with that in our quiet alone time, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  possibly wearing an upscale turtleneck. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=536.6s)]
*  We'll let you know. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=539.9000000000001s)]
*  But the question is, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=541.32s)]
*  once we've had an act of war like this, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  how does the country respond? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=545.6s)]
*  How do we all respond? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=546.72s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom, as Sandy would say. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=548.72s)]
*  Well, obviously we need a commission, of course, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=550.86s)]
*  and a criminal investigation, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=553.48s)]
*  there's probably one underway by the way, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=555.12s)]
*  and then a day of remembrance [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=556.5200000000001s)]
*  because you can't let the memory die. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  So who's gonna lead this? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=560.24s)]
*  Well, the obvious candidates, Liz Cheney, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=561.1600000000001s)]
*  Adam Schiff, and speaking of crying, Adam Kinsinger. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=563.96s)]
*  They're the naturals. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=567.94s)]
*  We called them today to see what they're planning, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=569.4000000000001s)]
*  how are we gonna commemorate this latest insurrection. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=572.24s)]
*  They haven't gotten back to us yet, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=573.64s)]
*  probably sleeping or weeping. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=575.12s)]
*  But we can assume from past experience [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=577.8s)]
*  that Adam Kinsinger feels this really deeply, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  really deeply, watch. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=583.1999999999999s)]
*  Talk about the impact of that day. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=584.56s)]
*  But you guys won. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=588.16s)]
*  You guys held. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=591.4s)]
*  Democracies are not defined by our bad days. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Adam Kinsinger's right. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=600.76s)]
*  And we've made fun of him in the past, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=603.6s)]
*  like a grown dude crying on TV. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=605.12s)]
*  We mock that, we apologize, Adam Kinsinger. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=607.36s)]
*  We can recover. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=610.5200000000001s)]
*  But there's only only one path toward recovery. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=612.2800000000001s)]
*  And if you talk to any recovery expert, they will tell you, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=614.44s)]
*  the way to recover is to viciously punish [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=616.84s)]
*  the people who hurt your feelings. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=620.44s)]
*  Step one, it's always step one. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  So we're going to have to meet out [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=625.76s)]
*  some pretty serious punishments. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  Stephen Colbert's team of insurrectionists [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=629.56s)]
*  have been jailed for one night. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=631.56s)]
*  That's not a lot. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=632.96s)]
*  The penalty for insurrection is death. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=634.28s)]
*  We're not calling for that here. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=637.0799999999999s)]
*  This is a moderate show. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=638.8s)]
*  These are our fellow Americans. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  We owe them a second chance. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=641.48s)]
*  Thankfully, there's recent precedent to help guide [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=643.24s)]
*  inappropriate punishment. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=645.88s)]
*  What is the right punishment for insurrection? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=647.68s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGgXz7g57A&t=651.4s)]
