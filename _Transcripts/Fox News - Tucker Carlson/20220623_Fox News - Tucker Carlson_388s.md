# January 6 hearing target Jeffrey Clark recounts FBI raid
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY)
*  You sit in your seat, read Joe Biden's staff prepared card today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=0.0s)]
*  You sit in your seat. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=6.4s)]
*  Apparently Ron Klain was worried Biden was going to sit in someone else's seats. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=7.84s)]
*  They put it all caps. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=11.48s)]
*  You sit in your seat. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=12.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=13.48s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=14.48s)]
*  Well, the January 6th committee is investigating an insurrection in Washington. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=16.2s)]
*  The insurrection. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=20.8s)]
*  But what's interesting is there's been no investigation of any kind into an actual insurrection [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=22.16s)]
*  that happened two years ago in May of 2020. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=28.8s)]
*  A mob set fire to a historic Episcopal church right outside the White House, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=33.92s)]
*  and they injured more than 60 Secret Service officers as they tried to storm the White House grounds. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=38.24s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump was inside, so the media applauded it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=43.92s)]
*  And so the siege of the White House continued all month. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=48.16s)]
*  On June 22nd of 2020, that was two years ago this week, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=51.08s)]
*  the mob tried to tear down the Andrew Jackson statue in Lafayette Square right in front of the White House. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=54.64s)]
*  Do you remember this? No one else seems to. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=59.56s)]
*  Here's the footage. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=61.28s)]
*  What do we want? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=62.28s)]
*  Justice! [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=63.28s)]
*  What do we want? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=64.28s)]
*  Now! [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=65.28s)]
*  What do we want? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=66.28s)]
*  Justice! [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=67.28s)]
*  What do we want? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=68.28s)]
*  Now! [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=69.28s)]
*  Raise a lot of questions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=70.28s)]
*  Where were the police? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  They had ropes around the statue right in front of the White House and no one was doing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  anything about it? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=95.68s)]
*  There's a lot of blame to go around for that, by the way. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=97.56s)]
*  A lot. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=99.64s)]
*  But that's not an insurrection? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=101.28s)]
*  Well, not if no one remembers it even happened. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=103.36s)]
*  And that's why that footage has been memory-holed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=105.92s)]
*  You probably haven't seen it in the last two years. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=107.88s)]
*  That's because what's happening in Congress right now is not about an insurrection. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=111.16s)]
*  It's about using the mechanics of the federal government, which you pay for, especially [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=114.64s)]
*  the Intel and law enforcement agencies, to crush and silence anyone who opposes the Democratic [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  Party and Joe Biden. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=126.0s)]
*  That's not an overstatement. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=128.64s)]
*  One of the political opponents of the January 6th committee is targeting is a man called [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=129.64s)]
*  Jeff Clark. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=133.64s)]
*  He was Assistant Attorney General during the previous administration. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=134.64s)]
*  Before dawn on Wednesday, which is, say, yesterday, a large group of armed federal agents wearing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=137.64s)]
*  body armor with weapons raided Jeff Clark's home. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=144.16s)]
*  They dragged him into the street in his pajamas. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=149.12s)]
*  Now, what did Jeff Clark do wrong? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Was he selling fentanyl? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=153.2s)]
*  Was he human trafficking on the Mexican border? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=155.22s)]
*  No. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=158.1s)]
*  Jeff Clark did not commit any crime. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=159.1s)]
*  What he did wrong was calling for an investigation into voter fraud. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=161.38s)]
*  We are happy to have Jeff Clark join us now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=165.02s)]
*  He's a senior fellow with the Center for Renewing America. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=168.3s)]
*  Jeff, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=170.54s)]
*  This is a Soviet account, really. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=172.86s)]
*  So tell us what happened and why. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=177.5s)]
*  It is, and good to be here, Tucker. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=180.46s)]
*  So yesterday at about just before 7 a.m., there was loud banging at my door, insistent [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=183.17999999999998s)]
*  banging. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=189.14s)]
*  So I just rushed down as fast as I could. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=190.14s)]
*  I quickly figured out that there were agents there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=192.33999999999997s)]
*  I opened the door and asked for the courtesy to be able to put some pants on and was told, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=196.5s)]
*  no, you got to come outside. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=201.14s)]
*  So I came outside. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=202.5s)]
*  They swept the house. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  Eventually, they let me go back inside and put the pants on. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  Then by my count, at one point, 12 agents and two Fairfax County police officers went [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=209.5s)]
*  into my house, searched it for three and a half hours. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=217.94s)]
*  They even brought along something, Tucker, I've never seen before or heard of, an electronic [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  sniffing dog. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=226.26s)]
*  They took all of the electronics from my house. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=228.34s)]
*  I don't blame the agents. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=232.98s)]
*  I think what you're talking about in terms of weaponization is really about who's pointing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=234.62s)]
*  the agents and telling them what to do, Tucker. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=239.9s)]
*  So Peter Strzok, who worked at the FBI, is effectively a criminal, in my view, never [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=243.34s)]
*  really punished, sent out a tweet today mocking you and gloating over the fact that the Biden [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  administration stole your cell phone and will now be reading all of your private messages. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=253.34s)]
*  At what point can we say the Department of Justice where you once served is a political [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=259.14s)]
*  instrument? It's completely out of control. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=264.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is highly politicized. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=265.14s)]
*  And it's also part, Tucker, if you didn't know it, of a nationwide effort yesterday. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=269.62s)]
*  There were multiple states where multiple people were roughly simultaneously raided [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  for their electronic devices. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=281.62s)]
*  And that obviously requires a high level of coordination. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  And look, with the hearing that was pointed at me and targeting me today with the special [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=287.86s)]
*  audience member of Sean Penn, so you know this is Hollywood, the very next day, it looks [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=295.7s)]
*  highly coincidental. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=303.26s)]
*  And, Tucker, I just don't believe in coincidences. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=304.26s)]
*  So you know Chris Ray, of course, who runs FBI. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=308.42s)]
*  You probably know Merrick Garland. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=312.1s)]
*  He's been around Washington a long time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=313.5s)]
*  Both of them have decided to pervert and corrupt our most basic institutions on behalf of Joe [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=316.58000000000004s)]
*  Biden. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=323.3s)]
*  Did you think they were capable of doing that when you worked there? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=324.3s)]
*  I argued in front of Merrick Garland. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=328.94s)]
*  I got a very respectful hearing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=331.58000000000004s)]
*  I think I was going to win that case, but we wound up actually settling it in the shadow [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=333.98s)]
*  of what everyone assumed was going to be a victory. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  Sometimes that happens in financial cases. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  Chris Ray was with me in the Justice Department. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=345.06s)]
*  He was just in the Criminal Division back in Bush 43. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=347.26s)]
*  So I do know both of them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=350.58s)]
*  And I just think we're living in an era that I don't recognize. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=353.42s)]
*  And increasingly, Tucker, I don't recognize the country anymore with these kinds of Stasi-like [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  things happening. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=363.98s)]
*  Yeah, this is Stalinist. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=366.98s)]
*  At some point somebody's going to fight back and it's going to get super ugly. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=368.62s)]
*  I pray that doesn't happen, but I think it probably will. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=371.62s)]
*  The whole thing is so sad. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=375.22s)]
*  And I'm sorry that you were caught up in it, in your pajamas. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=376.22s)]
*  They could have just called you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=379.3s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=380.54s)]
*  Jeff Clark, I appreciate you coming on. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=381.54s)]
*  I hope you'll come back and tell us where this winds up. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=383.38s)]
*  It's creeps. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=385.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=386.7s)]
*  Will do. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQaPLkKgYZY&t=387.7s)]
