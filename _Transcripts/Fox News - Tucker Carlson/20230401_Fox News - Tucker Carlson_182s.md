# Taking away guns is a ‘horrible’ idea: Ryan Cleckner
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w)
*  Ryan Klechner is an attorney and former Army Ranger. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us to assess all of this. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=2.5s)]
*  Ryan, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=4.24s)]
*  So when you take these people seriously, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=5.84s)]
*  and I think we probably should, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=8.36s)]
*  since they have more power than most of us do, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=9.84s)]
*  what they're suggesting is disarming a country [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=12.88s)]
*  that owns billions of rounds of ammunition, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=16.56s)]
*  400 million firearms. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=18.68s)]
*  What they're calling for [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=20.62s)]
*  is a totalitarian state and civil war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=22.32s)]
*  You're absolutely right, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=27.12s)]
*  because who's gonna be going to try to collect these? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=27.96s)]
*  Who's gonna be actually effectuating these policies? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=30.32s)]
*  I mean, I say that when a politician tells you [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=32.72s)]
*  you don't need a gun, it's time to get a gun. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=35.88s)]
*  And these comparisons we're making to these other countries [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  that are largely homogenous, mostly isolated countries [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=41.8s)]
*  that don't have porous borders like we do, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=46.16s)]
*  where drugs and crime are just flowing across freely, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=48.8s)]
*  are able to effectuate some sort of gun control, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=52.52s)]
*  but it still doesn't help. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  Gun violence might go down, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  but I'm not a believer [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=59.46s)]
*  that gun violence is the only bad thing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=60.300000000000004s)]
*  I think all violent crime is bad. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=62.18s)]
*  And I actually have an article [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=64.22s)]
*  on Sean Davis's The Federalist website [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=65.42s)]
*  about how violent crime in Australia [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=67.78s)]
*  has actually increased [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=69.94s)]
*  ever since they took away people's ability [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=71.38s)]
*  to defend themselves. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=73.18s)]
*  Well, crime by the government has increased dramatically. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=74.58s)]
*  I mean, the Australian government, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=77.1s)]
*  the authoritarian Australian government, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=78.54s)]
*  put people in concentration camps [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=80.14s)]
*  for violating their non-scientific COVID rules. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, civilians are not the only people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=85.02s)]
*  who commit crimes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  The biggest crimes are always committed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=88.74s)]
*  by the government, always. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=90.06s)]
*  Yes, and every bad government that we look at in history, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=93.3s)]
*  what's one of the things they did first? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  They take away the guns. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  See, the problem too is I am tired of being painted, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  even by family members or people that I know [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  as someone that doesn't think [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=105.66s)]
*  these mass shootings are horrible. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=106.58s)]
*  I think they are so horrible that I think my ideas, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=108.06s)]
*  and ideas that show that we shouldn't have disarmed schools, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=111.58s)]
*  we should actually protect our children, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=114.34s)]
*  are so much better at saving these lives. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=116.66s)]
*  That's why it's so important to me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=119.42s)]
*  Rushing to try and get rid of guns, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=121.14s)]
*  to keep someone from doing something horrible like this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=123.26s)]
*  It's the same as a little banning fentanyl. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=125.5s)]
*  We have 100% ban on fentanyl in this country. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  Is it doing a whole lot of good? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=131.26s)]
*  No, it's everywhere. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=132.66s)]
*  And matter of fact, think of the people [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=134.5s)]
*  that are in control of these drugs, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=136.58s)]
*  that are 100% banned, zero tolerance, 100% banned. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=138.5s)]
*  Those people that disregard the laws, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=141.46s)]
*  we call them criminals, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=143.62s)]
*  they're the ones that would have the guns. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=145.22s)]
*  This is a horrible idea. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  It's not gonna make anyone safer. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  It's bad all around. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, if we wanna stop murders [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=152.78s)]
*  to find out why murderers commit murder, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=153.86s)]
*  and we should take a look at this manifesto, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=156.06s)]
*  and if the murderer from Monday says, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=157.74s)]
*  I'm committing this mass shooting [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=159.62s)]
*  because Tennessee has lax gun laws, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=161.06s)]
*  then let's have that conversation, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=163.5s)]
*  but I suspect that's not what it says. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=164.62s)]
*  Ryan Klechner, great to see you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=166.74s)]
*  No, one AR-15 was used for evil, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=167.58s)]
*  one was used for good, thanks. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=169.26s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP41j1yR44w&t=170.66s)]
