# Everything Buttigieg touched with transportation 'was a miserable failure': Hendrickson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg)
*  For generations we imagined that the real problem with our infrastructure in this country was that the roads had potholes and the bridges were falling apart [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=0.0s)]
*  It was Pete Buddha judge of McKinsey & Co one of the first to know [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=7.92s)]
*  The real problem with our roads and our bridges in this country is they're racist [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Here he was in November [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=18.04s)]
*  I'm still surprised that some people were surprised when I pointed to the fact that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  If a highway was built for the purpose of dividing a white in the black neighborhood [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=23.56s)]
*  Or if an underpass was constructed such that a bus carrying mostly black and Puerto Rican kids [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=29.4s)]
*  To a beach or there would have been in New York was designed too low for it to pass by but that obviously [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=35.92s)]
*  Reflects racism that went into those design choices [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=42.12s)]
*  Racist bridges now we wanted to hear more from Pete Buddha judge. He's the transportation secretary now [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=45.8s)]
*  He's breastfeeding today, so he couldn't join us [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=50.22s)]
*  But we did want to know what his record on infrastructure was while mayor of South Bend, Indiana [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, there's a website called real news, Michiana [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=58.06s)]
*  And it turns out according to their reporting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  But a judge does not have a very good track record when it comes to fixing roads his so-called Keystone traffic [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=63.22s)]
*  Initiative that he put into place as mayor of South Bend [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=69.34s)]
*  Reportedly led to the death of an 11 year old boy that initiative [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=72.06s)]
*  Deactivated a non-essential traffic light and the boy was struck by a truck [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=76.18s)]
*  Casey Hendrickson is the host of the burning truth in South Bend, Indiana [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=80.5s)]
*  We're happy to have him join us tonight Casey [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming on and I wish we talked to you earlier before Joe Biden made this guy in charge of all of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=86.18s)]
*  Our infrastructure, but what kind of a job did he do running the infrastructure of South Bend? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=91.62s)]
*  Well, first of all, I would like to say that we're not going to apologize for him because I tried to warn everybody about this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=96.7s)]
*  When he was being considered for ambassador to China that made sense Tucker [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  But when he was made the transportation secretary [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=107.22s)]
*  I think we laughed collectively in my studio for about an hour because he has zero success in infrastructure planning in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=110.10000000000001s)]
*  South Bend at all everything he touched that dealt with transportation was a miserable failure [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=117.18s)]
*  Including smart streets which got Tristan killed and he was warned about that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  He was told that there was serious issues with there being no lights and people going to that bus depot at 7 in the morning [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=127.06s)]
*  It doesn't get light until around 8 o'clock in South Bend in the wintertime [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=133.78s)]
*  So you can't see children crossing the street and people have been hit at these roundabouts [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=137.1s)]
*  Especially in front of the hospital for a long time and this is supposed to be the pedestrian friendly revamping of downtown South Bend [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=141.82s)]
*  So look, this is a new show. So we want both sides. We want to be fair [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=149.7s)]
*  So I just have to ask you the question. Did he make the roads less racist though? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=152.88s)]
*  He obviously made them more dangerous, but did they become more equity oriented as mayor? I [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=158.3s)]
*  Suppose that's a great question [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=163.54s)]
*  He's increased people's commute by about 13 minutes or so and I would say he had probably made it more racist considering the demographics [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  Surrounding downtown South Bend Tucker because what he did is he effectively increased response time from first responders? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=172.98s)]
*  And there's some high crime areas around there that would primarily affect minorities in South Bend and he's actually made it a lot worse for them [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=179.82s)]
*  To get aid from first responders than before [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=186.22s)]
*  Wait, you're telling me that a guy from McKinsey spends all his time yammering about how much he loves black people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=189.26s)]
*  But then actually hurts them when he has a chance [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=194.42s)]
*  Go figure who knew [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  It's weird. Here's the thing he [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=200.26s)]
*  Tucker Pete Buttigieg and his his party have been talking about how South Bend has been [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=203.1s)]
*  Systemically racist for as long as I've been here [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=207.42s)]
*  There hasn't been a Republican mayor since before I was born the South Bend Common Council is dominated by Democrats [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  If South Bend is a systemically racist city it is because the Democratic Party made it that way [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=216.14s)]
*  You know, they used to say that about Montgomery, Alabama, too, and they were right. I sure appreciate your coming on Casey [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. And again, my apologies for not talking to you earlier. It would have been helpful. Thank you [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=229.1s)]
*  I appreciate the time. Thank you so much. Thanks. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniqLZqb4xg&t=233.45999999999998s)]
