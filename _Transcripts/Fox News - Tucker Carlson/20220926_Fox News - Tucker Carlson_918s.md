# Tucker Carlson: People are upset about this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Monday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=2.52s)]
*  Not a lot of Americans pay attention to European politics [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=3.36s)]
*  unless they're very bored or work at some think tank. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=6.0s)]
*  And that's understandable, but it's a shame really, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=8.88s)]
*  because if you look closely what's happening in Europe, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=10.8s)]
*  you can learn a lot about what's happening here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  Despite the castles and the funny accents [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=15.68s)]
*  and the smelly cheese, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=17.48s)]
*  Europe is not actually that different [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=18.64s)]
*  from the United States, at least in this way. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=20.28s)]
*  European leaders run their countries [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=22.86s)]
*  pretty much the same way our leaders run our country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=24.72s)]
*  They yammer on endlessly about democracy, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=27.8s)]
*  but then at the same time they do their best [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=30.64s)]
*  to avoid democracy's most basic requirements [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=32.36s)]
*  like free speech and representative government. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=34.88s)]
*  A few years ago, the prime minister of Italy at the time, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=38.46s)]
*  Paolo Gentiloni, bragged to the World Economic Forum [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=41.800000000000004s)]
*  about his plans to quote, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=45.56s)]
*  bring more social justice to the country, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  by which he meant importing many more thousands [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=49.3s)]
*  of poorly educated economic migrants [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  from the third world into Italy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=53.24s)]
*  We are very open on migration, he said. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  We are saving lives at sea. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  Ooh, saving lives, huh? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Congratulations, you're such a good person. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=61.72s)]
*  But the question is, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  and it's a relevant question in a democracy, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=65.36s)]
*  what are the people who live in Italy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=67.72s)]
*  that would be your constituents think of that idea? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=69.2s)]
*  Well, as the prime minister explained, he didn't care. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=72.6s)]
*  Quote, a demand for more democracy not only is wrong, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=75.44s)]
*  it's even dangerous. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  You following this? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=81.8s)]
*  You run a country in the name of the people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=82.92s)]
*  You're not a king, you're a democratically elected leader. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=85.64s)]
*  You run it in the name of the people who live there, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=88.26s)]
*  but at the same time, it's quote, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=90.56s)]
*  dangerous to allow the opinions of those people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=91.8s)]
*  to influence your decisions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=94.1s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=96.54s)]
*  Oh, it does, because it's exactly the kind of democracy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=97.92s)]
*  that we live in, which is to say a fake one. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  In fact, there is no majority in any country [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=104.6s)]
*  on planet earth that thinks open borders are a good idea [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=107.12s)]
*  or that considers global warming the single biggest problem [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  or that thinks it's wise to quarantine the entire population [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=114.0s)]
*  because of a flu virus. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=116.94000000000001s)]
*  No large group of people anywhere wants these things. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  But in the West, everybody gets them anyway [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=123.58000000000001s)]
*  because politicians don't care what you think. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Your opinion is dangerous. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=127.94000000000001s)]
*  Shut up, racist! [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  So it goes without saying, this can't last. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=131.96s)]
*  A system like this cannot endure forever [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=133.60000000000002s)]
*  because it's inherently unstable. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=135.52s)]
*  You can't tell people they're in charge [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  of their own government. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=139.96s)]
*  It's a democracy, we promise, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=140.8s)]
*  and then ignore over decades [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=142.6s)]
*  their most strongly held opinions on things that matter. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=144.52s)]
*  That doesn't work long-term. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  They will rebel, guaranteed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=149.44s)]
*  And the best you can hope for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=152.0s)]
*  is that they will do it peacefully. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=153.72s)]
*  In Italy, they seem to be doing just that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=156.16s)]
*  This summer, a conservative populist called Georgia Maloney [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  started showing up with strong support in the polls. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=162.0s)]
*  Maloney was no radical. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  Reviews would have seemed perfectly ordinary [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=166.36s)]
*  just a decade ago. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=167.96s)]
*  But because she resolutely refused to bow to the twin gods [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=169.44s)]
*  of climate and mass migration, people panicked. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=173.52s)]
*  The president of the European Commission, in fact, on camera, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=177.16s)]
*  commanded Italians not to vote for her. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=179.84s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=184.18s)]
*  If things go in a difficult direction, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=186.46s)]
*  I've spoken about Hungary and Poland. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=189.28s)]
*  We have tools if things go in the right direction. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  And people as a body that is always, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=195.28s)]
*  where always governments have to be accountable to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=201.0s)]
*  play an important role. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  Oh, if things go in the wrong directions, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  in other words, if voters disobey, quote, we have tools. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=207.84s)]
*  Oh, you do, do you? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=212.72s)]
*  Well, that sounds like a threat [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=214.12s)]
*  because of course it is a threat. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=215.36s)]
*  But it turns out Italians are so desperate, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  they no longer care. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=219.62s)]
*  They're not afraid. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=220.78s)]
*  And they're not afraid because neoliberalism, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  which that lady is just espousing, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  has destroyed their country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=225.52s)]
*  Energy prices in some places in Italy are now up more than [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=227.24s)]
*  400% over last year. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=229.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, a pointless war in Ukraine [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=233.4s)]
*  and self-destructive climate policy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=234.84s)]
*  It's not an accident and everyone knows it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, parts of Italy are becoming flat out dangerous. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=239.44s)]
*  That hasn't happened before outside of Sicily, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=241.88s)]
*  but it's happening now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=244.44s)]
*  Why? Everyone knows why. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=245.52s)]
*  And government statistics show why. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=247.28s)]
*  It's migrants who are driving much of the crime, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=249.12s)]
*  a huge amount of the crime. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=251.12s)]
*  So these aren't mysteries, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=253.45999999999998s)]
*  but you're not allowed to acknowledge them in public. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=254.62s)]
*  Period. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=258.14s)]
*  In some places it's illegal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=258.98s)]
*  But Maloney is one of the very few politicians [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=261.3s)]
*  who doesn't care and has been willing to say the obvious, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=264.08s)]
*  the truth out loud. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=266.3s)]
*  And as a result of that, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=268.98s)]
*  because she's been willing to say [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=270.08s)]
*  what everybody actually knows, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=271.14s)]
*  last night her party called Brothers of Italy [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=272.64s)]
*  won an overwhelming victory in Italy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=275.44s)]
*  They took both majorities in the Houses of Parliament. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=278.5s)]
*  So by Italian standards, in fact, by American standards, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  this is a revolution. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=285.5s)]
*  But unlike most revolutions, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=287.46s)]
*  the person at the front of it [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=288.97999999999996s)]
*  can actually explain what she's about. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  She can articulate it in a way people understand. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  She's smart. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=296.06s)]
*  This is part of the speech she gave earlier this year [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=298.17999999999995s)]
*  that led to last night's results. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=301.38s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  Everything we stand for is under attack. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=304.41999999999996s)]
*  Our individual freedom is under attack. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  Our rights are under attack. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=311.3s)]
*  The sovereignty of our nation is under attack. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=313.22s)]
*  The prosperity and well-being of our family is under attack. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  The education of our children is under attack. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=318.98s)]
*  In front of this, people understand that in this age, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=321.62s)]
*  the only way of being rebels is to preserve what we are. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=326.22s)]
*  The only way of being rebels is to be conservatives. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=331.24s)]
*  They will try to take everything away from us, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=335.9s)]
*  but they can't take away who we are. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  Cherishing who we are, knowing what we stand for, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=345.94s)]
*  is all we need to face this challenge. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  She's not kidding. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=356.29999999999995s)]
*  She's as serious as the moment [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=357.82s)]
*  we are currently living through. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=359.85999999999996s)]
*  Our rights are under attack, she said. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=362.34s)]
*  The sovereignty of our nation is under attack. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=363.94s)]
*  And critically, quote, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=366.78s)]
*  the prosperity and well-being of our families is under attack. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=368.14s)]
*  And that's true. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=372.5s)]
*  That's why it's resonant, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=373.34s)]
*  because it's real and not just in Italy, it's true here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=374.3s)]
*  American families are facing the very same onslaught [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=377.3s)]
*  from the very same poisonous ideologies. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=380.3s)]
*  The difference is that in this country, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=383.14s)]
*  it's rarely acknowledged, except on the fringes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=385.42s)]
*  Melania is not on the fringes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=387.42s)]
*  She's the new prime minister of Italy, she will be, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=388.7s)]
*  and she's saying it out loud. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=391.14s)]
*  Contrast that to what's happening in the United States. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=392.74s)]
*  House Republicans just spelled out what they're running on. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=395.02s)]
*  It's a document called The Commitment to America. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=397.18s)]
*  It's fine, probably not much in it, you disagree with it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=399.66s)]
*  Have you heard of it? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=402.58s)]
*  No, you probably haven't. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=404.1s)]
*  You probably haven't read it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  Nobody really cares. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=407.46000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=408.54s)]
*  Because there's nothing real in it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=409.36s)]
*  There's not a single word in that document [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=411.38s)]
*  about the attacks on the American family [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=413.98s)]
*  that you see every day. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=415.62s)]
*  That's at the center of most people's concerns. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=417.92s)]
*  How are my kids? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  Will they have a life that resembles mine? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=421.46s)]
*  That was called the American dream. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=424.62s)]
*  Does it still exist? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=425.7s)]
*  Will they be able to afford to live the way they grew up? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=426.9s)]
*  Will they have the opportunities that we had? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=429.85999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=432.65999999999997s)]
*  People are upset about that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=434.26s)]
*  Why wouldn't they be? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=435.34s)]
*  But nobody says it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=437.74s)]
*  And that's odd because we know, and now it's been proven, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=439.74s)]
*  that when politicians are brave enough to tell the truth [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=442.52s)]
*  about what's actually happening, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=444.94s)]
*  they tend to be rewarded for it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=446.85999999999996s)]
*  Once again, here's the incoming Prime Minister of Italy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=450.22s)]
*  And as you watch this, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=453.5s)]
*  ask yourself if you would vote for a candidate like this [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=454.66s)]
*  if you had the chance in our country. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=457.94000000000005s)]
*  In Monte, there's what we're doing today. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=460.70000000000005s)]
*  Why is the family an enemy? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=462.06s)]
*  Why is the family so afraid? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=463.82000000000005s)]
*  There's a unique answer to all these questions. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=466.1s)]
*  Why does it define us? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=469.24s)]
*  Why is it our identity? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  Why is everything that defines us in this time an enemy? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=472.26000000000005s)]
*  For those who would like us not to have an identity anymore [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=476.3s)]
*  and for those who are just slaves, perfect consumers. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=479.7s)]
*  Chesterton, more than a century ago, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=483.98s)]
*  let's see if I can find it, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=487.86s)]
*  fires will be lit to show that two plus two equals four. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=491.1s)]
*  Swords will be cut down to show that the leaves [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=495.82s)]
*  are green in summer. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=499.34s)]
*  That time has come, gentlemen. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=501.02s)]
*  We're ready. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=502.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=503.7s)]
*  So that's the person who's being described [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=504.54s)]
*  all over American television, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=505.78000000000003s)]
*  including on channels that should know better, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=506.94s)]
*  as quote, far right. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=508.78000000000003s)]
*  That's far right, really? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=510.34000000000003s)]
*  Because she acknowledges [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=511.38s)]
*  that American families are under attack. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=513.1s)]
*  Of course they are. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=515.22s)]
*  You think it's accidental? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=516.9s)]
*  And she explains why. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=517.74s)]
*  And it's simple. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=518.58s)]
*  If you want to establish totalitarian control [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=519.4200000000001s)]
*  over a country, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=522.38s)]
*  of course you have to destroy the family first. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=523.7s)]
*  Because nobody with deep family loyalty, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=526.14s)]
*  the one thing every person should have, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=528.82s)]
*  no one who has a deep family loyalty, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=530.94s)]
*  every person should have. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=532.7s)]
*  No one who has that will ever pledge absolute obedience [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=534.1s)]
*  to a politician. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=537.6600000000001s)]
*  Why would you? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=538.5s)]
*  So if you want absolute obedience, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=539.86s)]
*  you have to sever family ties. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=541.6600000000001s)]
*  And that's why state schools brainwash your children [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  with values that you despise, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=546.5400000000001s)]
*  and then instruct your children to turn you in [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=548.46s)]
*  as a thought criminal if you object. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=551.34s)]
*  That's happening. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=553.86s)]
*  It's not your imagination. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=554.9000000000001s)]
*  And it's happening for a reason. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=556.1800000000001s)]
*  Wokedness is not just a political ideology. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=557.98s)]
*  It's not just something annoying [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=560.1s)]
*  that emerged on college campuses that we can ignore. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=561.38s)]
*  It's a state religion that supplants actual religion, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=564.86s)]
*  which is also being destroyed. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=569.98s)]
*  There's a reason the strip bars and the liquor stores [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=571.58s)]
*  and the weed dispensary stayed open under COVID, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=574.78s)]
*  but the churches didn't. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=577.42s)]
*  If you can't draw the connection between those dots, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=579.3s)]
*  you're missing it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=582.78s)]
*  But Bologna didn't miss it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=583.62s)]
*  She understands it perfectly. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=585.1s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=586.62s)]
*  Only a few months ago, European Union bureaucrats [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=588.06s)]
*  wrote a document hundreds of pages long, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=592.9799999999999s)]
*  telling us that in order to be inclusive, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=596.9799999999999s)]
*  we had to exclude all references to Christmas. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=601.3399999999999s)]
*  Jesus, Mary, and all Christian names [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=606.5799999999999s)]
*  were to be removed from all official communication. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=611.6199999999999s)]
*  Will we surrender in front of this? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=616.62s)]
*  No, we will not. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=619.98s)]
*  We will fight it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=622.54s)]
*  We will fight it standing tall. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=624.54s)]
*  So they hate your family, they hate your religion, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=630.34s)]
*  and you don't actually have to put up with it [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=633.42s)]
*  because it's a democracy [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=635.1s)]
*  and you're supposed to be in charge, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=636.14s)]
*  you being the population. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=637.26s)]
*  That's a radical message. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=639.14s)]
*  God, family, country. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=640.34s)]
*  That's not radical. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=641.9s)]
*  It's hard to imagine a more wholesome message, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=643.22s)]
*  a more pro-human platform. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=645.14s)]
*  Fascists don't believe in God [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=648.42s)]
*  because God is a rival to their power, of course. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=649.78s)]
*  This is a person publicly professing faith in God. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=653.02s)]
*  That's so scary, but it is so scary. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=656.46s)]
*  It's so scary to the people running [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=659.26s)]
*  and benefiting from our current system. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=662.1s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=665.02s)]
*  She's not the first person to say this. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=666.54s)]
*  People have said it before, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  but she's just been rewarded for saying it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=670.3s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=673.5s)]
*  The population likes it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=674.6999999999999s)]
*  This is what they actually want. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=676.3399999999999s)]
*  They're not that worried about global warming. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=678.42s)]
*  They don't want open borders. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=679.98s)]
*  They think the woke stuff is absurd. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=681.5799999999999s)]
*  They want to see what they think. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=683.02s)]
*  And now it's obvious because she just won. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=686.4599999999999s)]
*  And so even in this country, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=690.18s)]
*  the people running and benefiting [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=691.5799999999999s)]
*  from a deeply corrupt and doomed system are hysterical. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=693.3s)]
*  Watch the reaction to that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=696.9s)]
*  I want to start today [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=699.3s)]
*  by talking about a politician on the right [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=700.14s)]
*  who we should all be worried about, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=702.02s)]
*  who's on the rise today, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=703.5799999999999s)]
*  a politician who has brushed off accusations of fascism. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=705.06s)]
*  What separates us from, let's say, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=707.9399999999999s)]
*  Italy, who elected a fascist? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=711.5s)]
*  She is from fascist roots. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=714.74s)]
*  A far-right political party whose roots go back [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=716.62s)]
*  to post-World War II neo-fascist. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=719.18s)]
*  A party that has its roots in Italian fascism. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=721.9399999999999s)]
*  Its roots in Italian fascism. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=726.5799999999999s)]
*  Define that for us, if you would, Joe Scarborough. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=729.0999999999999s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=731.0999999999999s)]
*  You're an idiot, you can't. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=732.1s)]
*  But the point is, fascist means unacceptable. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=733.7s)]
*  Whatever this chick is saying, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=736.82s)]
*  you're not allowed to agree with. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=738.0600000000001s)]
*  They're very worried [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=740.14s)]
*  that that many Italians do agree with it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=741.86s)]
*  So she has to be completely unacceptable. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=744.74s)]
*  Don't read further. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=746.98s)]
*  She's a fascist. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=748.38s)]
*  And in case you missed the theme, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=749.5400000000001s)]
*  a recent New York Times piece on Mlony [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=751.1s)]
*  mentioned fascism or fascist 29 times. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=752.7s)]
*  Not a subtle newspaper. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=756.5400000000001s)]
*  Apparently she's on the verge of invading Poland. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=757.94s)]
*  We should be worried. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=760.38s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=762.14s)]
*  They said it could never happen again. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=763.58s)]
*  100 years ago, Mussolini marching on Rome, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=766.4200000000001s)]
*  plunging the country into two decades of dictatorship, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=769.9s)]
*  an alliance with Hitler and a second World War. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=773.38s)]
*  Today, the fascist party is gone, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=776.62s)]
*  but many say these are their political heirs, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=778.66s)]
*  the brothers of Italy. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=781.5400000000001s)]
*  Once on the fringes, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=783.3000000000001s)]
*  they've ballooned into the biggest party in the country. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=784.5400000000001s)]
*  Now their leader, Giorgia Maloney, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  is poised to head the most hard right government [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=790.18s)]
*  since Il Duce. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=792.62s)]
*  The 45 year old firebrand insists she's no fascist, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=794.06s)]
*  just a proud conservative and nationalist, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=797.7399999999999s)]
*  comfortable nevertheless, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=800.3399999999999s)]
*  with some of the hallmarks of Italian fascism, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=801.8599999999999s)]
*  like this motto. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=804.26s)]
*  We will defend God, Fatherland and Family. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=805.26s)]
*  God, Family, Country. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=811.3s)]
*  Well, that's pretty scary. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=812.66s)]
*  Not a word about climate or equity. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=814.3399999999999s)]
*  But again, it's their hysteria [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=817.62s)]
*  and their total unwillingness to ask obvious questions [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=820.7s)]
*  that lets you in on the secret, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=823.94s)]
*  which is they're panicked [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=826.0200000000001s)]
*  because they know the current system is doomed. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=827.46s)]
*  And in fact, what happened last night in Italy [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=830.1400000000001s)]
*  is the best case scenario for them [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=832.46s)]
*  because it was a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=834.5s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=837.82s)]
*  That's what you want. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=839.1400000000001s)]
*  In a democracy, people should be allowed [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=840.7s)]
*  to have some influence on the priorities of the government [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=842.86s)]
*  that claims to represent them. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=846.3000000000001s)]
*  And when they speak in an election, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=848.62s)]
*  the people who've been repudiated [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=851.0600000000001s)]
*  have a moral obligation to pause just for one second [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=852.74s)]
*  and ask, why didn't they like what I was offering them? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=855.46s)]
*  They have a right to an opinion. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=859.14s)]
*  In fact, their opinion is at the center of our system, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=860.38s)]
*  this democracy. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=863.1s)]
*  But they never asked themselves that. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=865.5s)]
*  They never take any blame whatsoever. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=867.22s)]
*  They didn't in 2016, when Trump got elected, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=869.02s)]
*  they immediately blamed Putin or Macedonian bot farms. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=871.38s)]
*  They never blamed themselves. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=876.44s)]
*  And so they never learned a single thing from what happened. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=877.98s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=882.4200000000001s)]
*  not simply in American television, but also in Italy [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=883.58s)]
*  and also in the European Union. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=886.34s)]

*  peacefully at the ballot box [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=892.74s)]
*  are completely unwilling to learn from that vote. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=895.34s)]
*  They'll just keep ramming their unpopular garbage [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=898.34s)]
*  down the throats of a deeply ungrateful nation [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=900.7s)]
*  until there's an actual rebellion. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VzT4n27AC8&t=903.14s)]
