# Tucker Carlson: America will 'never be the same' if President Biden's border policies continue
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk)
*  So Ukraine is now demanding a lot more money from the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=0.0s)]
*  In fact, more money than its entire pre-war budget consisted of. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=3.48s)]
*  Obviously, members of both parties in Congress will grant that request [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=6.92s)]
*  because securing Ukraine's border is their top priority, says Mitch McConnell. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=9.72s)]
*  George W. Bush agrees. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=13.8s)]
*  Nothing's more important than Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=14.76s)]
*  Showing that our southern border, which remains completely open. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=16.92s)]
*  Congressman Andy Biggs, who represents the state of Arizona, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=19.32s)]
*  was at the border in Yuma a few days ago. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=21.48s)]
*  Here's some of what he saw. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=23.72s)]
*  After they've crossed the reservation, they walk down this dirt road [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=25.96s)]
*  and they come up here, CBP tells them all to sit down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=29.2s)]
*  They're going to wait now hours for buses to come and process these individuals [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=33.72s)]
*  and take them through Yuma processing center. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  What we would say military age young men, single men over there in that area. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=40.96s)]
*  So there's lots, lots going on here in the Yuma border. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=45.96s)]
*  So why is this happening? Super simple. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=53.28s)]
*  Joe Biden opened the border and hasn't closed it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Why is he doing that? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=57.04s)]
*  Probably a lot of reasons, all of them sinister, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=58.0s)]
*  anti-democratic and in fact evil. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=60.08s)]
*  This is a crime. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=61.64s)]
*  The United Nations just declared that the US-Mexico border [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=63.52s)]
*  is the deadliest in the world. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=65.84s)]
*  In the world, in the United States. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Welcome to Third World America. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=69.24s)]
*  Multiple Texas counties declared today [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=70.4s)]
*  that what's happening at the border constitutes an invasion because it does. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=72.84s)]
*  Andy Biggs, as we told you, represents Arizona in the United States Congress. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=77.6s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=80.4s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=81.2s)]
*  So members of Congress from Texas call this an invasion. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that's fair? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=86.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's fair. It's accurate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  Arizona's attorney general has said the same. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=91.4s)]
*  And what you're seeing from the videos when I was down there, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=94.08s)]
*  Tucker, that is a regular routine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=97.92s)]
*  And we met people from Georgia, all kinds of Latin American countries, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=101.16s)]
*  African nations, China, India. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=107.12s)]
*  That happens every morning. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=109.76s)]
*  I mean, that was about 4 to 4.30 in the morning that day. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  And it's non-stoppable because we've basically said, come in. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=116.56s)]
*  And you ask them, why are you here? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  And they'll say, Biden told us to come in. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=123.04s)]
*  That is an invasion. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=124.56s)]
*  That is an invasion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=126.12s)]
*  So this will completely change America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=127.4s)]
*  In a democracy, the citizens get to decide what kind of country they want to live in. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=130.0s)]
*  Now, the Biden administration is, it'll never be the same country, ever. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=135.12s)]
*  Millions of new people, all illegal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=139.0s)]
*  So, like, why is this not a crime that's being prosecuted? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=141.32s)]
*  Why isn't the president being impeached, the president being impeached for this? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think he should be. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=148.44s)]
*  I think because they've deliberately, when I say they, I mean, President Biden, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=149.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Secretary Mayorkas, they have deliberately stopped enforcement under [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=153.56s)]
*  Title 8, which is the Immigration and Nationalization Act. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=159.04s)]
*  And then you also have Title 42 that they're hedging on. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=162.76s)]
*  They're not enforcing the law. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=168.4s)]
*  They're not allowing ICE to actually remove people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=169.72s)]
*  And they're actually surreptitiously providing a de facto amnesty program to a lot of people [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=173.32s)]
*  that they're catching and releasing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=178.92s)]
*  To me, that's a violation of the law. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=180.24s)]
*  And it's dangerous to this country because, I mean, we could talk about terrorist crime. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=182.72s)]
*  We could talk about the drugs that are coming in. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=187.96s)]
*  We could talk about the danger to the people that are coming in illegally. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=190.2s)]
*  But the guy in Viking horns is a threat to democracy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=194.36s)]
*  You know, Biden and Mayorkas are a threat to democracy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=196.64s)]
*  A real threat, I would say. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=198.72s)]
*  Congressman Andy Biggs, I appreciate it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  From Arizona, good to see you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlhyVMxVMk&t=201.52s)]
