# Woman reportedly fired for following ‘transphobic’ Twitter accounts speaks out
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg)
*  It was tough to believe we live in a country where you could be fired from your job for having the wrong thoughts or reading unapproved political materials. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=0.0s)]
*  But unfortunately, that is the country we're becoming. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  It happened to Carolyn. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=9.92s)]
*  She used to work for a small games company called Limited Run Games. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=11.0s)]
*  Then the mob found out that she followed certain forbidden Twitter accounts, including Libs of TikTok. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=14.48s)]
*  Now, this mob, and this is usually the case, was led by a single activist on Twitter, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=21.16s)]
*  along with a small message board called Reset Era. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=27.28s)]
*  As a result of this mob action, Carolyn was fired. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=31.12s)]
*  We want to understand exactly why and what happened. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=35.2s)]
*  Carolyn joins us tonight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=38.56s)]
*  Kara, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=39.84s)]
*  Do we oversimplify that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  So you followed the wrong people on Twitter and lost your job for it? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=43.84s)]
*  Um, to me, I think that's kind of what sums it up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=48.84s)]
*  The funny thing about it is it's accounts that I follow accounts of every political affiliation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=54.96s)]
*  And I'm the type of person who likes to see from every direction. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=64.28s)]
*  And so I follow a variety of accounts. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=69.64s)]
*  So when they called you in to fire you, did they say, we believe you've been reading the wrong things? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=75.12s)]
*  Like, how did they phrase it? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=82.64s)]
*  No, no, no, it was more of the public, the publicity that was getting it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=85.36s)]
*  That was the main thing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=94.36s)]
*  They had no qualms with who I followed or anything like that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=95.76s)]
*  But you lost your job as a result of it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=102.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=105.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't I mean, that's not supposed to happen in a free country with a First Amendment, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=107.84s)]
*  I would hope not. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=116.32s)]
*  Yeah, but it did. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=118.84s)]
*  You're you're so good humored about it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=121.08s)]
*  I'm like outraged on your behalf. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=123.52s)]
*  I hope that the lesson you take is you go follow even more forbidden Twitter accounts and that you make more money and an even better job. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=125.28s)]
*  We are rooting for you, Carolyn. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=132.36s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=133.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo0jJTq-Cg&t=135.51999999999998s)]
