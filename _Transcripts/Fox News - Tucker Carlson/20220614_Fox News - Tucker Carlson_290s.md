# My Jan. 6 arrest was not a coincidence: Ryan Kelley
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA)
*  Somehow, in the last presidential election, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Biden got 12 million more votes than Barack Obama, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=2.0s)]
*  who was the second coming of Christ, as you remember. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=6.36s)]
*  12 million more votes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=8.24s)]
*  How'd that happen, exactly? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=9.32s)]
*  Well, today, at the latest January 6th hearing, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=11.28s)]
*  Liz Cheney of Wyoming explained, shut up. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=13.64s)]
*  Say a word about mail-in balloting, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=16.72s)]
*  and you're immoral. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=18.68s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=19.56s)]
*  The president understood, even before the election, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=21.04s)]
*  that many more Biden voters had voted by mail [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  because President Trump ignored the advice [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=27.4s)]
*  of his campaign experts [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  and told his supporters only to vote in person. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  Former President Trump's plan to overturn the election [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=35.76s)]
*  relied on a sustained effort to deceive millions of Americans. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=38.6s)]
*  But he betrayed the trust of the American people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=43.68s)]
*  He ignored the will of the voters. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=47.08s)]
*  He lied to his supporters and the country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=49.42s)]
*  And as a result of his loss, decided to wage an attack [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=53.36s)]
*  on our democracy, an attack on the American people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=57.84s)]
*  by trying to rob you of your voice in our democracy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=61.92s)]
*  Trump is bad. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=66.8s)]
*  Thanks, Mom. New message from the Democratic Party. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=68.36s)]
*  But what's the answer? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=71.16s)]
*  Reassure us that the last election was on the level. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=72.8s)]
*  No. This show trial is not reassuring anyone. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=76.0s)]
*  This whole effort, of course, is an attempt to punish anybody [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=78.6s)]
*  who challenges the reigning orthodoxy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=82.16s)]
*  Ryan Kelly learned that the hard way. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=84.8s)]
*  Ryan Kelly is running for governor in Michigan. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=86.84s)]
*  At least one poll had him leading the Republicans [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  running for governor in Michigan. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=91.28s)]
*  He was just arrested last week [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=92.52s)]
*  because he was at the Capitol protests on January 6th. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=94.16s)]
*  We've been wanting to talk to him. Tonight we can't. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Kelly, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=99.64s)]
*  So just to get the factual stuff right out, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=102.16s)]
*  did you commit a crime on January 6th? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  There was no crime committed, Tucker, no. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  Never entered the Capitol building, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  exercising my First Amendment. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=112.92s)]
*  Those of us that have questions about the 2020 election results, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  they want to intimidate us and they want to threaten us, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=119.04s)]
*  not just me and my family, but my supporters as well, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  all of us that love America. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  So the government doesn't typically arrest [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=127.0s)]
*  leading candidates in gubernatorial races [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=129.12s)]
*  unless they have you on video accepting cash [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=131.36s)]
*  and putting it in your freezer or something, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=133.8s)]
*  which is not the case here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=135.12s)]
*  Were you surprised that federal agents showed up at your home? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  It was definitely a surprise. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=142.12s)]
*  I think that it's a narrative [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=144.84s)]
*  that the Democrats have been pushing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=146.8s)]
*  because of their failed policies in regard to energy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=148.56s)]
*  and regard to all of the things that matter to Americans. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=151.76s)]
*  And we see this continued left-wing agenda being pushed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=155.88s)]
*  And this January 6th committee, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=160.12s)]
*  I think a lot of Americans see right through this, Tucker. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=162.4s)]
*  They understand what the Democrats are up to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=165.08s)]
*  and it's not a big deal to them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=167.4s)]
*  They want to know what the government is going to do [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=170.48s)]
*  to actually do the things that are affecting [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=173.36s)]
*  their day-to-day life to bring solutions [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=175.84s)]
*  to our state and to our country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=178.16s)]
*  And so we see just this continuation of the left [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=179.88s)]
*  pushing further left in common sense, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=183.24s)]
*  reasonable people like myself stepping up [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=185.44s)]
*  to make sure we save our state and our country [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=187.88s)]
*  and bring relief to American families. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=190.0s)]
*  But I mean, arresting people seems, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=192.24s)]
*  I mean, that's a brand new frontier in American politics. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=194.44s)]
*  From what I can tell, you aren't doing anything different. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=197.92s)]
*  In fact, you're doing things that seem much less criminal [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  than say Ray Epps, who has not been arrested. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  And there are many others who are on video [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=205.2s)]
*  standing where you're standing were not arrested. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=206.76s)]
*  Do you think there was a political motive here [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  in arresting you as a candidate? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely a political motive. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=214.6s)]
*  Just 12 hours before I was arrested, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden was on Jimmy Kimmel saying [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=218.56s)]
*  that he's going to arrest his political opponents. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  There's no coincidence in the timing of this, Tucker. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  It's right in alignment with all of this political theater [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=226.12s)]
*  that the Democrats are pushing with their J-6 committee. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=228.96s)]
*  And there's no coincidence here. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=232.08s)]
*  And like you said, some of the polls [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=234.0s)]
*  are showing that I'm winning. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  The support has been tremendous. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=237.52s)]
*  We see new polls now where my lead has grown substantially. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=239.08s)]
*  And I take that as a sign of gratitude to my supporters [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  for all of the things that they've stepped up [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=247.0s)]
*  and helped with and just a reason for me [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=249.72000000000003s)]
*  to work twice as hard, get my message out there [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=251.72000000000003s)]
*  so I can serve the great people of Michigan [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=253.88000000000002s)]
*  as our next governor. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=256.76s)]
*  So you're running. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=257.8s)]
*  Bold. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=259.24s)]
*  Godspeed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=260.08s)]
*  I'm running, yes sir. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  Amen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  Ryan Kelly, thank you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=262.76s)]
*  We're moving forward. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  We intend to win on January, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=264.44s)]
*  and, oh, we still there? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=266.08s)]
*  Yep, I appreciate it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=270.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=271.36s)]
*  We intend to win on the second of August [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=272.2s)]
*  and again in November. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  May Congregation Whitmer a one-term governor. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=275.88s)]
*  We'll be watching. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=278.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  Changing the world and changing your life [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=285.92s)]
*  from Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ0Nm5aC6dA&t=288.24s)]
