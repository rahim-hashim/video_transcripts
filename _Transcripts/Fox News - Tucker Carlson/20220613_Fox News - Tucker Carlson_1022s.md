# Tucker Carlson: This is a total lie
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, Joe Biden's publicist just announced with a straight face he plans to run again [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=2.2s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  We'll address that at some length tomorrow, but first, another crisis in the news. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  So after the killings in Buffalo and Uvalde a few weeks ago, you begin to hear people [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=13.64s)]
*  on television talk about something called red flag laws. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=17.76s)]
*  The government, they informed us, could actually end mass shootings tomorrow simply by taking [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=21.28s)]
*  the guns away from mass shooters before they commit mass shootings. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=29.72s)]
*  In fact, it's such an obvious solution that you had to wonder why we weren't already [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=30.72s)]
*  doing that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  Who does want to prevent mass shootings? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=36.4s)]
*  Well, only the gun lobby. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=38.0s)]
*  Everybody else cares about children. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=39.64s)]
*  So a lot of Americans, not surprisingly now, say they want red flag laws. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=41.84s)]
*  And why wouldn't they? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=46.66s)]
*  Like supporting Black Lives Matter or fighting climate change or getting the COVID shot or [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=48.0s)]
*  standing with the brave people of Ukraine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=52.08s)]
*  Red flag laws seem like one of those ideas that no decent person could possibly oppose. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=54.66s)]
*  You want crazy people to have guns? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=60.24s)]
*  Of course you don't. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=62.32s)]
*  Who would? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=63.56s)]
*  So naturally you're for red flag laws. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=64.68s)]
*  And in fact, we may soon get red flag laws across the country. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=66.84s)]
*  So what would that mean if we do? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=71.88s)]
*  Well, two things you should know. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  First, red flag laws will not end mass shootings, but red flag laws will end due process. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=74.92s)]
*  Due process is a simple concept, but it's the key to everything that is good about America. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=83.32s)]
*  In our system of justice, citizens cannot be punished without first being charged with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=87.78s)]
*  a crime. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=92.34s)]
*  Politicians cannot just decide to hurt you, throw you in handcuffs, lock you in jail, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=94.38s)]
*  seize your property, simply because they don't like how you think or how you vote. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=98.42s)]
*  No. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  Before they punish you, they have to go through a formal process in which they describe which [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  specific law you broke and exactly how you broke it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=108.3s)]
*  They have to prove it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=112.18s)]
*  For serious crimes with big penalties, the government has to convince a group of your [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=113.94s)]
*  fellow citizens first. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=117.32s)]
*  It's called a grand jury. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=118.6s)]
*  And this government must convince them that you deserve to be punished or they cannot [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=120.24s)]
*  proceed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  None of this is new. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=125.08s)]
*  This is the way we've done things in America for more than 200 years. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=126.08s)]
*  And it's exactly why we have and have always had the fairest justice system in the world. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  People move to this country from all over the globe to benefit from it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=134.82s)]
*  But red flag laws will end this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=138.6s)]
*  Under red flag laws, the government doesn't have to prove you did anything wrong in order [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=141.68s)]
*  you of your most basic rights. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  All that's required to punish you is a complaint, possibly even an anonymous complaint in which [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  somebody says you seem dangerous. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  Now that complaint doesn't come from a grand jury. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=156.88s)]
*  It can come from anyone, including someone who hates you or someone who simply doesn't [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  like your politics. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't matter because no jury will ever see it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  On the basis of that unproven complaint, you lose your freedom and your ability to defend [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  yourself and your family. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  Now how could that possibly happen in this country? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=173.64s)]
*  Well, the Supreme Court has said unequivocally that it can't happen here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=175.88s)]
*  A year ago, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Caniglia versus Strong. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=180.32s)]
*  Police in Rhode Island had seized the personal firearms of a 68 year old man whose wife had [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  called in a complaint against him after they had an argument. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  That man had committed no crime. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  He'd never been convicted of the crime and he was judged by doctors to be sane. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=194.32s)]
*  And yet the authorities took away his guns anyway. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=198.64s)]
*  He sued under the Fourth Amendment and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=201.4s)]
*  The result was not even close. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=204.84s)]
*  The Supreme Court sided with the gun owner in that case in a rare 9-0 decision. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  That means that every justice, liberal and conservative, agreed that authorities cannot [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=212.0s)]
*  just seize your property or throw you in jail because they don't like the way you look or [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=216.70000000000002s)]
*  because someone is mad at you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=220.28s)]
*  So red flag laws are unconstitutional. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=222.6s)]
*  Period. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=225.84s)]
*  We don't need to guess about that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=227.44s)]
*  And yet the Biden administration is pushing them anyway. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=229.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=231.92s)]
*  Because they don't care. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=232.92s)]
*  How is Joe Biden able to ignore a Supreme Court decision from last year? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=234.28s)]
*  Simple. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=239.44s)]
*  He declares an emergency and does what he wants. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=240.64s)]
*  He's done it before. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  The White House did the same thing with the eviction moratorium and vaccine mandates last [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  year. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  It's an emergency. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  We don't have time for due process. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  So you can see why Democrats love emergencies. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  Nothing gives them more power more quickly. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=254.48s)]
*  They've declared the atrocities in Uvalde and Buffalo an emergency, unlike the daily [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  mass shootings in Baltimore and Chicago, cities they run and whose killings they therefore [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=261.16s)]
*  assiduously ignore. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=265.66s)]
*  And on the basis of that emergency, they can move forward with gun confiscation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=266.66s)]
*  So the White House now wants Congress to pass a law paying the states to enact red flag [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  laws. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  And here's the amazing part. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=277.24s)]
*  At least 10 Republican senators are backing this effort from the Biden White House. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  That means this is virtually guaranteed to pass. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  What's their reasoning? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, here's one of those senators, John Cornyn of Texas. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  You have colleagues in the other chamber who are already coming out against this before [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  you even put out a proposal. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=296.32s)]
*  I'm not surprised. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=298.2s)]
*  Some people will not want to touch this with a 10-foot pole because they're concerned about [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  the politics of it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=306.28s)]
*  Yet I think this is a time where hopefully we can transcend that personal political interest [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=307.88s)]
*  and do what we think will save lives. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=314.52s)]
*  To me, that's the ultimate goal. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  We can do something sensible that does not undermine the rights of law-abiding citizens [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=318.88s)]
*  under the Constitution to keep and bear arms. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=324.32s)]
*  So there are two things to notice about that soundbite, which is so revealing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=328.0s)]
*  The first is the use of the term sensible. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=331.4s)]
*  Now that is a Democratic talking point approved by the DNC. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=333.96s)]
*  It's sensible gun safety regulation. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=337.6s)]
*  So here you have John Cornyn taking Nancy Pelosi's language. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=340.76000000000005s)]
*  He's doing it on purpose. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  And then you hear him describe anyone who disagrees with him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=346.48s)]
*  Why would you disagree with John Cornyn? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=349.48s)]
*  Well, according to John Cornyn, anyone who disagrees with him is, quote, concerned about [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=350.48s)]
*  the politics of red flag laws, not the wisdom of red flag laws, not whether or not red flag [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=353.8s)]
*  laws are constitutional, but the grubby politics. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=360.16s)]
*  In other words, says John Cornyn, anyone who disagrees with me is low and unethical. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=364.72s)]
*  Now if you're not used to hearing liberal demagoguery like that from Republicans, you [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  should know that John Cornyn is not the only one engaging in it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=375.04s)]
*  He is joined in this effort by Tom Tillis of North Carolina, Roy Blunt of Missouri, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=378.0s)]
*  Rob Portman of Ohio, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Mitt Romney, of course, of Utah, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, needless to say, Lindsey Graham of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  South Carolina, always on board for any bad idea, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=390.96s)]
*  It's particularly interesting to see Lindsey Graham on board, the person who encouraged [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=395.12s)]
*  Capitol Hill police to shoot more Trump voters, who has no problem with violence, whose life [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=399.52s)]
*  is organized around worshiping it, telling you that you can't have a gun. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=404.0s)]
*  Now all the senators whose names we just read, many of whom are retiring, so they're beyond [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=407.76s)]
*  the reach of voters, have the backing of the top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=411.32s)]
*  So what exactly are they backing when they back red flag laws? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=417.06s)]
*  Well, we can take Florida's experience as an example. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=420.82s)]
*  In Florida, the police can seize guns from people who pose a quote, significant danger [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=423.54s)]
*  based on quote, any relevant evidence. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=428.62s)]
*  Huh. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=433.5s)]
*  Any relevant evidence. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=434.5s)]
*  The law raises some obvious questions. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=435.54s)]
*  And the most obvious is, if you can seize people's guns without proving that they committed [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=437.38s)]
*  Why can't you imprison them without proving they committed a crime? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=444.16s)]
*  If you can take their guns, why can't you take their homes? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=448.52000000000004s)]
*  Why can't you empty their bank accounts? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=451.24s)]
*  Ooh, sound paranoid, Alex Jones stuff. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=452.76000000000005s)]
*  That just happened in Canada. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=454.92s)]
*  So what stops it from happening here? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  We already know the authorities are abusing the red flag laws already on the books. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=459.04s)]
*  Kendra Parris is a lawyer based in Florida who specializes in them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=463.12s)]
*  In a recent interview, she said, clients are able to hire lawyers have quote, vastly higher [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=466.5s)]
*  odds of getting their firearms back from the government. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=470.98s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  Laws like this always penalize the weakest. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  She said courts are taking a quote, better safe than sorry approach to avoid political [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=478.3s)]
*  blowback and the police are taking advantage of that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=481.94s)]
*  So court records show that cops in Florida often show up to the homes of citizens to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=484.70000000000005s)]
*  present them with quote, stipulations. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=487.70000000000005s)]
*  If you agree in writing to surrender your firearms, you have a chance of getting them [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=490.1s)]
*  back after a year. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=494.14000000000004s)]
*  Now as it happens, that's a pretty tempting offer when you have armed people in your living [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=497.14s)]
*  room. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=501.41999999999996s)]
*  But it is and it remains and again, we don't need to guess about it because the Supreme [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=502.41999999999996s)]
*  Court just ruled on this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=505.7s)]
*  It's unconstitutional and it is for several reasons. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=507.41999999999996s)]
*  It's a clear violation of the search and seizure prohibition in the Fourth Amendment, but it's [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=510.18s)]
*  also applied unfairly. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=514.54s)]
*  And even the people who wrote our current red flag laws admit that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=516.58s)]
*  In New York, for example, Assembly member Joanne Simon co-sponsored the state's red [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=519.9399999999999s)]
*  flag law. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=523.9s)]
*  Basically, it's all over the place, Simon admitted. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=525.1s)]
*  You have places where you have one filed and other places where it's 38 filed. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=527.34s)]
*  So how will these laws be applied? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=531.78s)]
*  Well, of course, they will be applied along political lines, just like everything else [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=533.5s)]
*  currently is in this highly politicized country. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  So if you don't like someone, if you don't like what someone believes, that person will [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=542.34s)]
*  be a target for unconstitutional search and seizure. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=545.54s)]
*  Armed authorities showing up in somebody's home and taking their personal property at [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=549.26s)]
*  gunpoint. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=553.0s)]
*  And if you doubt that that will happen, look at this. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=554.66s)]
*  This is the guy, the very same member of Congress who had sex with a Chinese spy demanding that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=558.4399999999999s)]
*  cops disarm Ben Shapiro because Ben Shapiro says things the Chinese government disagrees [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=563.98s)]
*  with. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=569.5799999999999s)]
*  This is from Eric Swalwell. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=570.5799999999999s)]
*  Quote, please tell me this lunatic does not own a gun. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=571.5799999999999s)]
*  Reason number 1578 that America needs red flag laws. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=574.5799999999999s)]
*  Eric Swalwell wrote that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=579.26s)]
*  Now what would qualify as a trigger for gun seizure in the view of Eric Swalwell under [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=580.94s)]
*  the red flag laws that he supports and now Republicans in the Senate support? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=587.0200000000001s)]
*  Well, here's the video that Ben Shapiro made that Swalwell thinks qualifies him for a red [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  flag law. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=597.24s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=598.24s)]
*  If you come to tell me that you're going to indoctrinate my kids in particular policy [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=599.24s)]
*  and that I can't pull my kid out of the school and send my kids to a school I want to send [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=602.5400000000001s)]
*  them to, that I can't go to the church or synagogue that I want to go to. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=605.58s)]
*  And if you make that national policy, not just California policy where I can move, but [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=610.14s)]
*  national policy, people are not going to stand for that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=613.8199999999999s)]
*  I now have two choices. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=616.86s)]
*  One is to leave the country utterly. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=617.86s)]
*  Two is to pick up a gun. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=619.58s)]
*  Those are the only choices that you have left me. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  And now people are like, oh, this is how could you say stuff like that? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=622.62s)]
*  How could you be so extreme? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=625.58s)]
*  It's not extreme to defend the fundamental rights the Constitution was created in order [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=627.46s)]
*  to protect these rights pre-exist government. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=631.5s)]
*  These re rights pre-exist government. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=635.74s)]
*  Well, actually our founding documents make that point, which he is merely repeating. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=637.8199999999999s)]
*  But on the basis of effectively quoting the founding documents of the country we live [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=642.3399999999999s)]
*  in, Eric Swalwell says the police should show up at Ben Shapiro's house and take his firearms [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=647.78s)]
*  away. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=653.4599999999999s)]
*  Does anybody, even Eric Swalwell, who is deranged, sincerely believe that Ben Shapiro is a violent [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=654.4599999999999s)]
*  threat to anyone? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=660.38s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=661.38s)]
*  Ben Shapiro is an ideological threat. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=662.38s)]
*  And an ideological threat is the only kind of threat people like Eric Swalwell actually [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=664.26s)]
*  care about. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=668.26s)]
*  And you know that when you look at the laws that they're pushing and that Republicans [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=669.7s)]
*  are backing. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=673.66s)]
*  If these laws were actually designed to fight gun crime, they would, among other things, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=674.66s)]
*  force prosecutors to enforce existing gun laws against people who are committing all [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=679.18s)]
*  the murders. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=683.26s)]
*  And it's not Ben Shapiro. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=684.26s)]
*  In Los Angeles and many other cities, that's not happening. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=686.06s)]
*  And that's why those criminals openly support the Soros-backed prosecutor George Gescombe. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=689.24s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=693.74s)]
*  I told you last time that he wanted to hire up and try to get something did before. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=694.74s)]
*  They re-elect somebody else besides Gescombe and bring back that little m****** life without [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=698.94s)]
*  parole and the death penalty. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=705.7s)]
*  If we could get the manslaughter, they'd be f******. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=708.3s)]
*  The manslaughter only carries 6, 9, and 12. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=711.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=714.9s)]
*  So, that's just one tape we could play you video, as we often do, of what's happening [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=715.9s)]
*  in our cities. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=720.58s)]
*  The only thing we're looking at is anarcho-tyranny. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=721.58s)]
*  So people who are favored by the regime can do whatever they want. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=724.1800000000001s)]
*  You vote the right way, commit whatever crimes you want. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=727.58s)]
*  In jail for 10 minutes, you're out. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=730.1800000000001s)]
*  Go do it again. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=731.58s)]
*  No problem. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=732.58s)]
*  Baltimore can happen. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=733.58s)]
*  Mass killing is on an ongoing basis for decades and no one will say a word. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=734.9000000000001s)]
*  But if you're disfavored by the regime, no punishment is too strong, no infraction too [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=739.0200000000001s)]
*  small. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=745.6600000000001s)]
*  None of the gun legislation that John Cornyn and these other pompous buffoons who were [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=748.98s)]
*  siding with Nancy Pelosi support. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=752.22s)]
*  None of that legislation would do anything about the core problem, which is DAs like [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=755.34s)]
*  George Gascon, who are failing to enforce existing gun laws. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=759.54s)]
*  Gun laws that, by the way, George Gascon himself, to name one example, is breaking. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=764.78s)]
*  A whistleblower in Gascon's office says he was fired for complaining about Gascon's [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=768.62s)]
*  habit of illegally carrying firearms aboard airplanes. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=771.9s)]
*  So why haven't the cops red flagged George Gascon and disarmed him? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=776.54s)]
*  Was anyone going to red flag Hunter Biden, who lied on a federal drug form? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=781.64s)]
*  Was a drug addict carrying an illegally obtained weapon? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=786.8199999999999s)]
*  No, of course not, because red flag laws aren't designed to punish the politically loyal. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=789.9s)]
*  And that's why you get scenes like this in New Orleans, which the police do nothing about. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=796.66s)]
*  Watch. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=800.98s)]
*  So, hey, John Cornyn, will your legislation do anything about that? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=806.54s)]
*  Because anybody who's okay with that or what's happening in downtown Chicago or downtown [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=823.4599999999999s)]
*  Baltimore, Gary, Indiana or Detroit, just pick a city. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=827.9399999999999s)]
*  Fix those things and get back to me about the AR in my closet. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=832.34s)]
*  By the way, New Orleans, the Soros-backed DA there, Jason Williams, isn't worried about [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=836.46s)]
*  what you just saw. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=841.38s)]
*  Last year, his office dismissed more than 60% of violent felony cases that came to his [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=842.38s)]
*  office, most of them involving firearms. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=846.3000000000001s)]
*  They just dismissed them. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=847.74s)]
*  These are the people worried about gun crime. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=848.74s)]
*  For perspective, the previous administration dismissed only 16% of those cases. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=852.4200000000001s)]
*  Another Soros-backed DA in Philadelphia has a similar record. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=856.86s)]
*  In the first half of last year, Larry Krasner's office withdrew or dismissed 65% of all gun [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=859.46s)]
*  charges. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=866.22s)]
*  Does that seem high? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=867.22s)]
*  Well, it is, because in 2015, that figure was just 17%. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=868.22s)]
*  New ideology, new outcome. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=872.3000000000001s)]
*  And of course, the outcome is more dead people. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=875.46s)]
*  But this law does nothing about that. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=878.12s)]
*  It ignores it completely in favor of redefining you as a violent threat and giving the authorities, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=880.14s)]
*  controlled by the Biden administration, the right to march into your house with guns [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=887.78s)]
*  drawn and disarm you. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=891.26s)]
*  So what are they ignoring? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=894.9s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=896.06s)]
*  Last year in Philadelphia, we saw a record set for homicides. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=897.3s)]
*  Already this year, more than 200 people have been shot to death in the city of Philadelphia, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=902.18s)]
*  which is not a huge city, and it's getting smaller. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=905.54s)]
*  On Friday, for example, a 14-year-old boy was killed in a drive-by. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=907.18s)]
*  On Saturday, a man was shot five times in West Philadelphia. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=910.06s)]
*  Did you see that in the news? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=912.5s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=913.5s)]
*  And on Sunday night, a man taking care of his mother in North Philadelphia was shot [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=915.5s)]
*  in the back of the head. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=917.62s)]
*  So if you're actually worried about gun crimes, gun atrocities, and for the record, we are, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=919.9s)]
*  because unlike Lindsey Graham, we actually hate violence, you would do something about [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=925.42s)]
*  this and punish the people who are committing gun crimes. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=928.42s)]
*  But no, they want to prevent you from defending your family from buying or holding guns. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=932.34s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=937.42s)]
*  Well, we don't need to guess because they're telling us. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=939.1s)]
*  Watch what the Attorney General of the United States, and just to restate, this guy actually [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=943.0200000000001s)]
*  is the Attorney General. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=946.0600000000001s)]
*  He's more than a craven political hack. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=947.5s)]
*  He runs the DOJ. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=949.7s)]
*  Watch him describe, Mr. Merrick Garland, the biggest threat facing this country today. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=951.1800000000001s)]
*  In the FBI's view, the top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=955.82s)]
*  motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocated for the superiority of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=963.1400000000001s)]
*  the white race. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=968.7800000000001s)]
*  That's just a total lie, actually. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=969.7800000000001s)]
*  And we have numbers to prove it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=972.38s)]
*  But you know it's a lie. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=974.1800000000001s)]
*  There's no justification rationally for what Merrick Garland just said. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=975.1800000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=979.34s)]
*  It's an obvious untruth, and anyone living in a major city knows that. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=980.34s)]
*  So why do they keep telling you that? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=984.62s)]
*  Well, because nothing the Biden administration is doing, and nothing that is happening in [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=987.7800000000001s)]
*  Congress right now, will actually address gun violence. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=991.5s)]
*  That's not the point, John Cornyn. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=996.1s)]
*  The point is to allow the Democratic Party to become even more powerful, and if it feels [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=998.74s)]
*  like it, to send its armed agents to raid the homes of Ben Shapiro and other disobedient [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLW40seir8w&t=1003.58s)]
