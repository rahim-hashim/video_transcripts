# If Biden doesn't run, who will Democrats turn to?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg)
*  The Democratic Party is terrified of the idea [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=0.0s)]
*  of Joe Biden running for president again [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=2.6s)]
*  because they think he will lose. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=4.48s)]
*  So they're undermining him, obviously. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=7.18s)]
*  But if it's not Biden, who would it be? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=9.24s)]
*  Who are the other potential candidates? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=11.68s)]
*  Well, Dana Perino is one of the best people [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=13.16s)]
*  in the world at thinking this stuff through. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=14.72s)]
*  She's co-anchor of America's Newsroom, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=16.5s)]
*  co-host of The Five, a friend of ours, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=17.92s)]
*  probably a lot of other things too, a dog owner. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=20.28s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=22.18s)]
*  Dana, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=23.32s)]
*  So- [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  I'm honored to be here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  Let's just stipulate that there are a lot of Democrats [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  who don't want Biden to run again. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=28.48s)]
*  Nothing personal, but his approval rating [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=29.84s)]
*  suggests he shouldn't run again. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=31.8s)]
*  So if it's not Biden, who would it be, do you think? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=33.18s)]
*  Well, do you remember a few months ago, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=36.96s)]
*  I came on your program and I suggested to everybody [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=38.34s)]
*  to keep a watch on Hillary Rodham Clinton [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=41.24s)]
*  because she was making noise [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=43.8s)]
*  about how the election was taken from her, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=45.52s)]
*  that she would be somebody who could save the party, really. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, there's three people who are saying this on the record. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=53.0s)]
*  One is Hillary Clinton, the other is Bernie Sanders, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=55.36s)]
*  and now your friend, Liz Warren. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=57.88s)]
*  So they all three are on the record of basically saying, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  look, if Biden chooses not to run again, I will run, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  although Hillary has not said that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=65.72s)]
*  She's basically intimated it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=66.8s)]
*  Then there's all of these people that are on background [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  and all of the mainstream media. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=71.12s)]
*  Have you noticed this, Tucker? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=72.44s)]
*  It's like, Joe Biden is leading us to a terrible place. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=73.4s)]
*  And so then the question becomes, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=77.6s)]
*  well, would it be Kamala Harris? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=78.72s)]
*  Immediately, if Joe Biden decided not to run, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  and I predict that if he were to make that decision, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  it would be the Wednesday before Thanksgiving [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=84.84s)]
*  or the Monday after Thanksgiving. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=86.7s)]
*  I just wanna be on record saying that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=88.38000000000001s)]
*  Immediately, the question is, will you endorse Kamala Harris? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=90.5s)]
*  And I think that is really in question and unlikely. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=95.58s)]
*  I think he sees a lot of his son, Bo, in Mayor Pete. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=98.94s)]
*  I also think that Stacey Abrams, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=103.62s)]
*  if she were to somehow win the governorship in Georgia, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=105.38s)]
*  she's an automatic entry into this race. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  Jared Polis is the governor of Colorado. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=112.62s)]
*  People are kind of interested in him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  He would be a way out of the box choice, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=116.3s)]
*  but a governor would be probably a better bet [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=118.3s)]
*  for the Democrats, though. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  I think that they are in for not only a bad 2022, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  but to me, it looks really hard for me to understand [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=124.86s)]
*  how they would turn it around by 2024. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=126.94s)]
*  It sure feels that way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=129.34s)]
*  Then there's Barack Obama, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=131.34s)]
*  who's already served his two terms, of course, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=133.5s)]
*  but he's emerged to weigh in on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=135.22s)]
*  some of the biggest policy issues of the moment, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=137.62s)]
*  which foreign presidents don't typically do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=139.46s)]
*  Do you see any significance in that? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=141.5s)]
*  Well, I think part of the things that we're dealing with now [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=144.34s)]
*  as a country is that we've never had [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=146.78s)]
*  so many former presidents still living, you know, this long. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=148.42s)]
*  I think Jimmy Carter hasn't been president since 1980, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=151.73999999999998s)]
*  and he is still with us, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=155.1s)]
*  and although he doesn't comment on foreign policy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  as much as he used to, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  he still likes to weigh in once in a while. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=159.78s)]
*  President Obama's a young man. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=161.62s)]
*  He's got this Netflix deal. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=163.14s)]
*  He's got a Spotify deal. He's out there and about. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=165.78s)]
*  And also, I think that he takes umbrage at the idea [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  that Joe Biden says that he's the most progressive president. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  Because Barack Obama wants that title. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  I also think that President Obama truly believes [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=176.38s)]
*  that in 2016, had he been able to be the one [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=179.18s)]
*  running against Donald Trump, that he would have run. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=182.22s)]
*  And so in some ways, he's like thinking [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=184.9s)]
*  that he is still the kingmaker [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=186.66s)]
*  and that Joe Biden in 2024 [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=188.82s)]
*  is not going to be in that position. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=190.66s)]
*  That position, I think, is still held by Barack Obama. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=192.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're exactly right about that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=196.18s)]
*  Dana Preno, thanks so much. Great to see you tonight. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf39HmLLyqg&t=198.5s)]
