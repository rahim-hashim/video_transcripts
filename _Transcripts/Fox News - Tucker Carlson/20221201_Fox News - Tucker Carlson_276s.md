# Retired NHL star Theo Fleury speaks out on the politicization of sports
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w)
*  So of all professional sports, the NHL hockey probably is the most conservative fan base. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=0.0s)]
*  And owners, more than 75% of National Hockey League owners donate to Republicans. Phil Anschutz, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  for example, who's legitimately conservative, owns the LA Kings. He's a mega donor to the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=14.48s)]
*  Republican Party. So it's a little weird, well, maybe it's not weird at all, that the NHL has [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=19.12s)]
*  decided to push woke propaganda on its fans. And boy is it. Gary Bettman, the commissioner of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  the NHL and league vice president, Kim Davis, now said they want fewer white people playing hockey. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=29.92s)]
*  Looking at the hockey landscape in five years, what was progress look like to both of you? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=36.56s)]
*  Commissioner Bettman. To me, to me, progress looks like that we become more reflective of the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=42.0s)]
*  communities in which our teams play, that there are more black players of both sexes, players of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=50.96s)]
*  color of both sexes, and that we are more diverse than we've been. Five years from now, I want hockey [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=60.08s)]
*  to be on the lips of boys and girls of color, just the way, you know, soccer and basketball [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=68.32s)]
*  and baseball is on their lips, something that they see as accessible. So attacking white people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=76.4s)]
*  Okay, I guess it's kind of common. You don't really notice it. It's totally immoral, by the way, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=85.04s)]
*  but it happens a lot. And then they're getting even more esoteric. This is an actual tweet from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  the league, the NHL, quote, trans women are women, trans men are men, non-binary identity is real. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  None of which is true, all of which is insane, but they just stated it like fact. So Theo Flurry is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  a hockey legend in Canada and the United States. He played in the league for a very long time, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=105.6s)]
*  most of his life. He joins us tonight. Theo, thanks so much for coming on. What do you make [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  of this? I mean, were race politics a big part of hockey when you were playing? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=116.24s)]
*  No, God, no. You know, I think the reason why we all gravitated towards hockey was, first and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  foremost, it was fun. And then secondly, you know, there was no politics involved. You know, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=130.0s)]
*  we played this sport because we absolutely loved it. For me personally, it was an escape from what [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=136.24s)]
*  was going on in my home life at that time. And, you know, I fell head over heels in love with the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=144.08s)]
*  sport. And, you know, I was really good at it, obviously, and pursued, you know, a career [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=150.64s)]
*  in this amazing game that we play. So clearly, you know, political forces hijack professional [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=159.44s)]
*  sports as a way to brainwash the young men who watch professional sports. That's, of course, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=167.44s)]
*  the entire point of it, strategic. But why does nobody push back? Like, no, you're not allowed to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=171.92s)]
*  do this in professional hockey. It's about hockey. Back off. Why does nobody say that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=176.24s)]
*  Well, I think it's a really, because we're so divided, Tucker, and deep down hockey players [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  are, you know, guys who are compassionate and empathetic. And, you know, it's just something [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=192.96s)]
*  that we don't want to get involved in. And it's an argument that we can't win, you know? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=199.52s)]
*  And so the reason why, you know, it doesn't matter to us who plays the sport, whether you're [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=206.0s)]
*  transgender, gay, or whatever. The reason why we play the game and the reason why the game is so [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=215.44s)]
*  amazing and so great is it's for everybody. Right. And the reason why we play the game [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=222.72s)]
*  is it's an escape from, you know, what's going on in our lives. And, you know, unfortunately, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=229.36s)]
*  politics has no place in any sport, whether that's football, basketball, hockey, baseball, politics [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  should never be a part of any kind of sport whatsoever. Of course not. And by the way, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  if they were calling for affirmative action in the NBA, I would be totally opposed to that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=253.52s)]
*  But they never will. Theo Flurry, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=258.8s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAtOxQn_4w&t=263.76s)]
