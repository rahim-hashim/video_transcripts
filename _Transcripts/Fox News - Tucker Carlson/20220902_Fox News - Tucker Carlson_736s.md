# Tucker Carlson: How could this be happening?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk)
*  Well, good evening and welcome to a special edition, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=0.0s)]
*  an analytical edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=2.5s)]
*  So everybody's focused on this fall's midterms [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=5.98s)]
*  for good reason, but maybe bigger elections [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=8.14s)]
*  have already happened, more meaningful elections. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=11.14s)]
*  These were local races that you probably haven't heard about [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=13.32s)]
*  because nobody pays attention. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  Here's what they were. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=16.82s)]
*  Last week, the Republican party flipped five [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=17.88s)]
*  majority left school districts in big counties in Florida. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=20.72s)]
*  That would be Miami-Dade, Sarasota, Duval, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=24.1s)]
*  Martin, Clay counties. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=26.34s)]
*  Miami-Dade alone is one of the biggest school districts [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=28.16s)]
*  in the entire country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=30.5s)]
*  It's got more than 300,000 students in it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=31.340000000000003s)]
*  So this change has major implications for the education [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=34.46s)]
*  and the future of millions of young people. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=37.68s)]
*  And it's not just happening in Florida. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=40.28s)]
*  A Texas school board that flipped the Republican party [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  earlier this year is already working to change things. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  They just voted to ban race hatred [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=47.24s)]
*  and gender cult ideology in schools. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=49.28s)]
*  So there may be a lesson here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  Let's say you're a Republican running for Congress [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=54.32s)]
*  in November, you might be wondering [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=56.2s)]
*  how did these Republicans win at the local level? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't just because it's a red wave year [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  because actually it's not really a red wave year so far, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  despite what you may have heard. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=66.72s)]
*  In other races so far, special elections, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=67.84s)]
*  Republicans have been underperforming amazingly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=71.16s)]
*  For example, in a special election last week [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=74.06s)]
*  in New York's 19th congressional district, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=75.68s)]
*  Democrat Pat Ryan beat Republican Mark Moral-Narrow. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=77.94s)]
*  Now in a red wave year, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  you would have thought the opposite would happen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=83.68s)]
*  This was a very tight district. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=85.6s)]
*  This district went for Joe Biden [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=87.02s)]
*  by only a point and a half in the last election. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  That's not exactly a huge margin for the Democrats, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=91.16s)]
*  but Democrats won anyway, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  despite the fact Joe Biden's approval numbers [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=95.16s)]
*  have dropped dramatically since then. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=97.24s)]
*  And it's not just in that district. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=99.88s)]
*  Democratic candidates across the country [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=100.96s)]
*  have been outperforming Joe Biden's 2020 numbers [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  in at least three other House special elections. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=105.52s)]
*  Elections in Nebraska, Minnesota, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=108.66s)]
*  and in the 23rd district of New York. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=110.8s)]
*  So why is the question? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  How could this be happening? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, the Democratic party is a really simple explanation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  Abortion, everything's about abortion. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  Democratic voters are really mad about Roe v. Wade [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=121.5s)]
*  being repealed in their voting in bigger numbers. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=123.63999999999999s)]
*  But there isn't actually any evidence at all [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  to support that that's true. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Instead, there is evidence [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=130.72s)]
*  that the Republican party may be at fault [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=132.44s)]
*  by alienating its own voters [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=135.12s)]
*  and not getting them to the polls. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=137.48s)]
*  Ryan Gerdusky has done a lot of work on this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=139.56s)]
*  He runs the 1776 Project PAC. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=141.5s)]
*  He supported those Florida school board candidates [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  who won last week. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=145.6s)]
*  Gerdusky recently wrote on his sub stack [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=146.82s)]
*  that Republicans are underperforming this year [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=148.72s)]
*  because turnout in rural counties is only about 30%, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=151.56s)]
*  30% of what it was in 2018, the midterm that year. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=155.22s)]
*  Cities and suburbs, meanwhile, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=159.88s)]
*  those are Democratic strongholds, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=161.26s)]
*  had double that level of turnout. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=162.78s)]
*  So why are Republicans winning [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=165.72s)]
*  in school board races in Florida, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=167.66s)]
*  but losing in big races in rural areas [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=169.1s)]
*  that they should be winning? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, the answer might lie with the candidates [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=172.94s)]
*  and what they're talking about in those districts. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=174.74s)]
*  For example, in February, Mark Molinaro, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  the guy who just lost in the race he should have won [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  in New York, told the county office building [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=182.68s)]
*  to illuminate the building in red and blue. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  No, those are not the county colors. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=188.36s)]
*  They're Ukraine's colors. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=190.24s)]
*  Right, as if his voters care. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  That's the message that Molinaro, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  as executive director of Dutchess County, New York, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=196.88s)]
*  sent to voters. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=199.44s)]
*  Poughkeepsie stands with Ukraine! [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=200.52s)]
*  Right, everyone's sympathetic to Ukraine, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=203.48s)]
*  but is that really the main issue? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=205.54s)]
*  No, it's a joke. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=207.38s)]
*  The same candidate also sent fundraising emails [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  to voters throughout upstate New York, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=212.0s)]
*  calling for aggression against Russia. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=213.66s)]
*  Biden is weak on Putin, Molinaro wrote. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=216.26s)]
*  Right, so does sounding like Lindsey Graham actually work? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=219.5s)]
*  Our borders are racist, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=224.94s)]
*  but Ukraine's borders are sacrosanct. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't work, here's what he said. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=228.62s)]
*  The question is, can we do more? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=231.24s)]
*  And should we do more? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=234.08s)]
*  The answer is yes to both. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=236.16s)]
*  As to my friends in the Pentagon, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=238.16s)]
*  you told all of us that this war would last [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=241.44s)]
*  three or four days, that Kiev would fall, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=244.06s)]
*  that the country would be overwhelmed [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=247.3s)]
*  by the Russian military. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=250.28s)]
*  They're wrong. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=252.7s)]
*  So, quite frankly, I trust President Zelensky's judgment [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=254.42s)]
*  about what would help him in real time [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=258.68s)]
*  more than anybody else on the planet right now. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=262.12s)]
*  Okay, so just to be clear to Republican candidates, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=266.36s)]
*  that was Lindsey Graham. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=268.38000000000005s)]
*  Your job is to make fun of Lindsey Graham [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=270.16s)]
*  and to disavow Lindsey Graham. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=272.92s)]
*  Your job is not to emulate Lindsey Graham [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  and steal his talking points. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=278.0s)]
*  And if you do emulate Lindsey Graham [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=280.04s)]
*  and steal his talking points, you will lose. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=282.1s)]
*  And the losing candidates did just that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  So compare what they were saying [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=287.82s)]
*  to what, for example, Joe Kent was saying [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=290.58s)]
*  in Washington state when he won his primary there [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=293.3s)]
*  as a challenger, watch this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=296.14s)]
*  If any of these representatives feel so passionately [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=298.54s)]
*  about how we have to go and save the Ukrainians [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=300.74s)]
*  and provide them with lethal aid [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=302.98s)]
*  and continue to push this escalation, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=304.14s)]
*  they need to go back to their districts [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=306.58000000000004s)]
*  and tell the American people, tell their constituents [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=308.1s)]
*  what they're asking them to do [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=310.68s)]
*  and what the ramifications potentially could be. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=312.22s)]
*  Why do foreign nations always come first? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=315.06s)]
*  Why do we secure their borders and not our own? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=317.34s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=321.34s)]
*  It's nothing against the Ukrainians. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=322.34s)]
*  Again, everyone feels sorry for the Ukrainians, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=323.74s)]
*  but Americans have a right to feel sad [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=325.78s)]
*  about what's happening in their country [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=327.56s)]
*  and to expect their politicians to work on fixing it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=329.06s)]
*  So if more Republicans in November [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=333.32s)]
*  say what you just heard Joe Kent say, they will win. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  If they talk about issues that people actually care about [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=339.14s)]
*  in this country, issues that are relevant to their lives, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=341.26s)]
*  they will win. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=343.42s)]
*  That's how they won those school board seats in Florida. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=344.26s)]
*  They weren't talking about Ukraine, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=346.48s)]
*  they were talking about the issues [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=348.22s)]
*  that matter to the voters in Florida. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=349.14000000000004s)]
*  Family, safety, happiness, the right of parents [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=350.62s)]
*  to decide what their kids learn in school. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  That message wins. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=356.54s)]
*  Obviously that's why Glen Youngkin [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=357.8s)]
*  became governor of Virginia. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=359.42s)]
*  We're gonna embrace our parents, not ignore them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=362.86s)]
*  We're gonna press forward with a curriculum [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=366.82s)]
*  that includes listening to parents' input, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=369.98s)]
*  a curriculum that allows our children [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=373.86s)]
*  to run as fast as they can, teaching them how to think, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=376.64s)]
*  enabling their dreams to soar. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=381.76s)]
*  Friends, we are going to reestablish excellence [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=384.76s)]
*  in our schools. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=388.32s)]
*  So that was Glen Youngkin's message. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=392.32s)]
*  You're a parent, schools exist for your children [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  and they're your children. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=397.8s)]
*  They don't belong to the teachers union [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=399.0s)]
*  and we're gonna listen to you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  Now Terry McAuliffe was running against Glen Youngkin. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=403.06s)]
*  He had the advantage of a lot of money. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=405.26000000000005s)]
*  He'd been governor of the state before. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=406.74s)]
*  Here was his message and we're quoting. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=408.66s)]
*  I don't think parents should be telling schools [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=410.54s)]
*  what they can teach. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=412.58000000000004s)]
*  Ooh, turns out most people disagree and he was destroyed. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=414.06s)]
*  His political career hit the brick wall [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  it had long deserved. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=419.62s)]
*  So it turns out the Republicans who focus [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  on the things that matter, families, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  protecting families will win. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=425.58000000000004s)]
*  Along with the 1776 project, Ron DeSantis [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=428.06s)]
*  was one of the biggest supporters [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=430.42s)]
*  of those school board candidates last week. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  This year DeSantis signed a law banning [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=433.96s)]
*  teachers unions members from talking about sex [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=436.52s)]
*  with your kindergartners, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=439.56s)]
*  cause it's creepy and should be illegal. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  DeSantis also fired a prosecutor [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=442.64s)]
*  who refused to enforce the law. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=444.64s)]
*  The prosecutor state attorney for this judicial circuit, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=447.56s)]
*  Andrew Warren has put himself publicly above the law. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=451.4s)]
*  In June of 2021, he signed a letter saying [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=456.64s)]
*  that he would not enforce any prohibitions [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  on sex change operations for minors. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=462.65999999999997s)]
*  And then most recently after the Dobbs decision [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  was rendered by the US Supreme Court, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=467.73999999999995s)]
*  he signed a letter saying he would not enforce any laws [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=470.12s)]
*  relating to protecting the right to life [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=475.41999999999996s)]
*  in the state of Florida. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=477.85999999999996s)]
*  And mind you, we have had prohibition [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=478.74s)]
*  on third trimester abortions for a long time. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=481.09999999999997s)]
*  When you make yourself above the law, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=484.5s)]
*  you have violated your duty, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=487.66s)]
*  you have neglected your duty [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=490.24s)]
*  and you are displaying a lack of competence [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=491.88000000000005s)]
*  to be able to reform those duties. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  And so today we are suspending state attorney, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=496.44s)]
*  Andrew Warren, effective immediately. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  So enforce the law. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=504.64000000000004s)]
*  That's a winning message too. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=507.66s)]
*  It's not just about one corrupt prosecutor [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=508.92s)]
*  in the state of Florida. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=510.84000000000003s)]
*  It's about ending the lawlessness [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=512.2s)]
*  that makes it impossible for Americans [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=514.4s)]
*  to live in their own cities. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=516.48s)]
*  Blake Masters caught on to that message. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=519.4s)]
*  That's how he won his primary in Florida, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=521.32s)]
*  or rather Arizona. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=523.08s)]
*  We can never amnesty any illegal alien, period. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=525.8000000000001s)]
*  If your first interaction with our country [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=529.72s)]
*  is to break its immigration laws, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=532.16s)]
*  you will never get amnesty. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  You will never become a United States citizen. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=535.5s)]
*  That is a line in the sand. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=537.72s)]
*  We will never cross it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=539.1800000000001s)]
*  We have to stop incentivizing illegal immigration. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=540.78s)]
*  If you're not deporting people, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=543.28s)]
*  you don't have border security. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=544.84s)]
*  Well, that's not hard. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  What's the point of having a country [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=548.72s)]
*  if your own government ignores the laws [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=550.32s)]
*  that your representatives passed? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=553.0s)]
*  How's that democracy? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=554.36s)]
*  No, it's chaos and lawlessness. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  And ultimately it's autocracy. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=557.76s)]
*  So national Republicans are not that dumb. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=560.0400000000001s)]
*  They could have figured that out, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=562.08s)]
*  but they're saying just the opposite. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=563.0s)]
*  It's almost like they wanna lose. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=565.44s)]
*  They're calling for gun confiscation, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=567.32s)]
*  gun confiscation, guns from law abiding citizens, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=570.08s)]
*  which would make you as reliant as possible [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=573.82s)]
*  on police forces that are underfunded. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=576.48s)]
*  How underfunded? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=580.12s)]
*  Have you checked the response times in your city recently? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=580.96s)]
*  In the city of New Orleans, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=584.0600000000001s)]
*  according to researcher Jeff Asher, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=585.1800000000001s)]
*  the police response time is now over two hours, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=586.46s)]
*  long enough for you to get killed. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=589.3000000000001s)]
*  The city is talking about canceling Mardi Gras [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=591.32s)]
*  because they have no cops. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=593.0200000000001s)]
*  In Seattle, the city council just reported, quote, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=595.2s)]
*  average and median response times [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=597.38s)]
*  up in nearly every precinct [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=599.1s)]
*  when compared with the last four years of data. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=600.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  In Austin, Texas, the police chief recently admitted [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=604.78s)]
*  that response times in the city's most serious emergencies [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=607.02s)]
*  are, quote, dramatically slower. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=609.66s)]
*  So that's a huge problem. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=613.24s)]
*  And it puts the onus of self-protection [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=614.4799999999999s)]
*  on the individual, on the family. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=616.02s)]
*  You have to protect your own family. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=617.88s)]
*  You don't have a choice at this point. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=619.18s)]
*  It's always been your right. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=620.78s)]
*  Now it's your obligation. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=621.92s)]
*  Are Republicans recognizing this? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, here's John Cornyn who represents Texas [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=625.14s)]
*  calling for gun confiscation [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=628.9399999999999s)]
*  so that you can't protect yourself [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=631.0799999999999s)]
*  when the cops don't show up. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=633.0s)]
*  I don't want us to pass a bill [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=635.76s)]
*  for the purpose of checking a box. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=637.12s)]
*  I want to make sure we actually do something useful, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=640.56s)]
*  something that is capable of becoming a law, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=643.96s)]
*  something that will have the potential to save lives. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=648.4s)]
*  I'm happy to report as a result of the hard work [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=653.6s)]
*  of a number of senators in this chamber [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=656.82s)]
*  that we've made some serious progress. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=660.12s)]
*  So soon, very soon, not soon enough for me, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=662.6s)]
*  but very soon we will see the text of bipartisan legislation [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  that will help keep our children and our communities safe. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=674.02s)]
*  It won't save a single child if he knows that. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=680.1600000000001s)]
*  What it will do is take firearms away from the law abiding [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=682.6s)]
*  while they remain in the hands of the law breaking. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=685.88s)]

*  That's a Republican United States Senator, an incumbent, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=691.48s)]
*  who unfortunately is not up for election this year, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=693.84s)]
*  but God willing will be punished for what he did. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=695.36s)]
*  But the point is the Republican Party in Washington [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=698.16s)]
*  seems to have missed all of this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=701.16s)]
*  Look at the elections taking place already this year, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=703.6s)]
*  and that's the clearest possible sign [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=706.08s)]
*  to the people who run the Republican Party, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=708.04s)]
*  stop talking about Ukraine, stop taking people's guns away, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=710.4200000000001s)]
*  start talking about things that they care about, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=713.84s)]
*  the economy, education, family, safety, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=716.0s)]
*  justice following the law, our border. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=718.52s)]
*  Those are the things that matter. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=721.88s)]
*  And if you don't acknowledge that, you're going to lose. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFczkAlwxQk&t=723.96s)]
