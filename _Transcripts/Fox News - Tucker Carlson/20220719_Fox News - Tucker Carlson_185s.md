# Pelosi's husband 'rising star on Wall Street:' Gasparino
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo)
*  Well, you often hear politicians brag about their public service. It's such a sacrifice. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=0.0s)]
*  And yet Nancy Pelosi's career suggests maybe you missed your calling. She spent three decades [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=8.44s)]
*  in Congress and yet somehow Nancy Pelosi is worth tens of millions of dollars. How'd she [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=14.18s)]
*  get so rich? Well, her husband, Paul Pelosi, operates an investment firm and he's made [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=19.32s)]
*  a lot of remarkably well-timed trades over the years. He really should be on CNBC. Just [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=24.52s)]
*  the other day, he made another one. Paul Pelosi snapped up between one and five million dollars [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=30.12s)]
*  worth of stock in NVIDIA. That's a semiconductor company. It turns out Congress is preparing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=33.64s)]
*  to vote on a $50 billion subsidy to the semiconductor industry. Charles Gasparino is a senior correspondent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=39.2s)]
*  with Fox Business. He joins us to assess this story. Charles, thanks so much for coming [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=47.08s)]
*  on. Is there any way to get Paul Pelosi's stock tips before he does the trades? I mean, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  this dude is a rising star on Wall Street. Dan Loeb, Stevie Cohen, they got accepted [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=57.4s)]
*  on this guy. He almost never misses. You know, it really is remarkable. You know, here's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=64.4s)]
*  the thing, Tucker, obviously this brings up the notion of is this insider trading? Is [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=69.2s)]
*  she giving him some tips? We should point out that, you know, the SEC and the DOJ have [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=72.44s)]
*  brought cases on insider tips via Pillow Talk. Trust me on it, it's happened. I don't believe [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=77.98s)]
*  this hits the insider trading bar. You know, a lot of this information about this legislation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  is bouncing around there. It has to be material, non-public, stolen, misappropriated. It kind [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=89.9s)]
*  of doesn't hit those barriers. But what this does hit is limousine liberalism, arrogance [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=95.30000000000001s)]
*  on steroids. I mean, he knows that he has an information edge. Not saying it's illegal, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  but he knows he has an information edge. He and his wife talk about stuff, right? Okay, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=106.22s)]
*  he knows what's coming down the pike. He's got sources and it's not probably not just [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=111.34s)]
*  her. I mean, it's really disgusting looking. And you know, if you want to understand why [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=115.74s)]
*  people distrust government, it's because of stuff like this. That's right. That's exactly [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=120.3s)]
*  right. It's not because some dignitary went to the Trump hotel, okay, which I read tons [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  of stories about that when Donald Trump was president. I mean, oh, they're trying to cozy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=130.34s)]
*  favor, cuddle up to the Donald Trump administration because they go to the Trump hotel in Washington. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=133.62s)]
*  That's nothing, okay? This is the bad stuff. Getting an edge, knowing that it just flies [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=139.38s)]
*  in the face of fairness. Again, I'm not saying this is illegal. As a matter of fact, I don't [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=144.5s)]
*  think it's illegal based on everything I know about insider trading, but it looks like crap. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  And it makes everyone cynical about democracy. It'd be very simple for Congress to ban any [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=153.70000000000002s)]
*  kind of trades like this. Just put it in a blind trust, but they won't. And you know [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  it's hypocrisy and it's and for someone who lectures us on the evils of capitalism, like [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=162.7s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi does all the time, it's really disgusting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=168.02s)]
*  Amazing. Charlie Gaspriano. Great to see you tonight. Thank you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWoXXhik1Uo&t=172.1s)]
