# Tulsi Gabbard: There is no turning back
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM)
*  Now, whatever your views are on Donald Trump, there's no denying that the unprecedented [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=0.0s)]
*  raid on his Palm Beach home earlier this week has set our country on a dangerous new course, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=6.92s)]
*  and there's no turning back. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=12.4s)]
*  The FBI's raid on Mar-a-Lago changed the country that we grew up in. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=13.76s)]
*  We grew up believing that, hey, our government will apply the law equally to all Americans, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=17.76s)]
*  whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=23.0s)]
*  We're seeing more and more that that country no longer exists. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=25.84s)]
*  Law enforcement at the highest levels of government, whether it's the DOJ, the Department of Homeland [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=29.12s)]
*  Security, the FBI, and now even the IRS, have been weaponized to target the political opponents [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=33.56s)]
*  of the Uniparty, the permanent Washington, and the Biden regime. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=38.96s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland has already issued a stark warning to anyone who dares [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=43.72s)]
*  to disagree with these tactics that are all hallmarks of a dictatorship. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=48.16s)]
*  Let me address recent unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=54.12s)]
*  Department agents and prosecutors. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  I will not stand by silently when their integrity is unfairly attacked. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  So you are not allowed to disagree with the FBI. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=69.2s)]
*  That is the new message. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=73.12s)]
*  The security state will label you an extremist for daring to challenge or disagree with the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=74.96s)]
*  regime's weaponization of law enforcement. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=79.52s)]
*  They talk about defending the blue. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=83.38s)]
*  They talk about defending law enforcement officers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=86.42s)]
*  They fly the flags. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=89.3s)]
*  They put on the bumper stickers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=90.3s)]
*  And yet, if it doesn't suit their political purposes, then they remain silent or even [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=94.22s)]
*  attack law enforcement officers. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=99.38s)]
*  Senator talked about the FBI's attack on our constitutional republic. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=101.58s)]
*  Another Republican senator accused them of being a third world Marxist dictator. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=106.94s)]
*  And yet, the silence is deafening. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=116.38s)]
*  These guys aren't Republicans, Joe. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=120.62s)]
*  These guys are extremists. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6XgCt0xSM&t=122.58s)]
