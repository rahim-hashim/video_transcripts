# These people were not protectors of the first amendment: Charlie Hurt
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM)
*  Charlie Hurt is with the Washington Times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us to assess what we have just learned about this. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=1.76s)]
*  Charlie, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  So on the one level, it's ridiculous, of course, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  that our biggest law enforcement agency [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=8.84s)]
*  is trying to force people to stop telling jokes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=10.44s)]
*  But on the other hand, this is a crime [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=13.0s)]
*  unless I'm missing something. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=14.76s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=17.64s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=19.0s)]
*  It's a clear violation of the First Amendment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=20.36s)]
*  And I think that this latest dump reveals, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=23.04s)]
*  I mean, literally, there were so many interactions [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=27.88s)]
*  between the FBI and other branches of the federal government [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=31.36s)]
*  and Twitter where they got together to collude [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=34.8s)]
*  on what was allowed to be shared on the platform [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=37.8s)]
*  and what was not allowed to be reported on the platform, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=40.56s)]
*  that they were actually opening up new back channels [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  on platforms that I had never heard of before, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  many viewers had never heard of before, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=49.8s)]
*  in order for them to keep in constant touch with one another. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=52.2s)]
*  And the thing to remember is, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=55.68s)]
*  if this were happening during the Pentagon Papers [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=57.24s)]
*  and we were realizing this degree of collusion [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=62.24s)]
*  between the FBI, the CIA, the federal government, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=66.24s)]
*  and the New York Times, or if we woke up today [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=70.6s)]
*  and there was this level of collusion [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=73.0s)]
*  between Fox News and the federal government [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=77.2s)]
*  in the middle of an election [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=80.08s)]
*  to determine what we would or would not report, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=81.64s)]
*  there would rightly be an outcry [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=85.16s)]
*  like we've never seen before. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=87.64s)]
*  And yet it happens here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=89.2s)]
*  And an alarming number of the supposedly mainstream media, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=91.08s)]
*  they're just like whatever. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't even say they're the media, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=96.88s)]
*  they're not journalists, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=98.24s)]
*  they're sock puppets for headquarters. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=99.08s)]
*  I mean, they're working on behalf of the state [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=100.64s)]
*  against the population of the country. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=104.72s)]
*  I mean, the FBI was working for a political party, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=106.84s)]
*  the one in charge. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=109.6s)]
*  So how is this different from what the secret police do [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=110.84s)]
*  in authoritarian countries? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=113.36s)]
*  Absolutely not different at all. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=116.16s)]
*  And you know, it's kind of amusing here [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=117.84s)]
*  is as soon as Elon Musk starts kicking journalists [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=119.72s)]
*  off of Twitter for doxing him, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=124.84s)]
*  they start squealing like stuck pigs. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  Of course, these same people never said a word, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=129.6s)]
*  not a peep out of them, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=132.24s)]
*  when the government in collusion with Twitter [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=133.76s)]
*  began silencing doctors and scientists [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=137.0s)]
*  at the height of a pandemic. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=140.64s)]
*  Not a word from these people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=142.6s)]
*  And so the idea that we're in a business [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=144.24s)]
*  where we're supposed to be the protectors [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=147.12s)]
*  of the First Amendment, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  you're on your own, man. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  These people are not protecting the First Amendment [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=152.12s)]
*  for anyone but themselves [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=154.68s)]
*  and for the most powerful government on the planet. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=157.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're literally FBI informants [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=161.84s)]
*  posing as journalists, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  and they should be called that, I think. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=165.8s)]
*  Shirley Hurte, great to see you tonight. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for the clarity on that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacnFULi1dM&t=170.36s)]
