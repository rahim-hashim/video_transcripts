# What is the controversy surrounding Meghan Markle and her sister?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg)
*  I don't even know this person who claims to be my sister. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=0.0s)]
*  Hmm, who to believe? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=2.88s)]
*  Well, we thought it'd be interesting to speak to Meghan Markle's sister, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=4.24s)]
*  Samantha Markle. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=6.96s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=7.92s)]
*  Samantha, thank you so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=8.72s)]
*  So what do you make of her claim that she like has no idea who you are? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=11.36s)]
*  Hi, Tucker. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=16.16s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=17.04s)]
*  Wow, just, you know, it's been just a series of lies and I can't believe we were essentially [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=18.88s)]
*  looking at a hundred million dollar fake news PR machine. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=25.92s)]
*  It's just, it's projection at its finest and it's almost comical. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  God, just so not true. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  And the whole grandmother thing that that just did it for us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=40.08s)]
*  I think my grandmother would be rolling over in her grave if she saw that and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  she didn't take care of her. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  She visited her. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  She never made apple butter with her because my grandmother was making apple butter like [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=54.56s)]
*  in the 1970s before Meg was even born. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=59.68s)]
*  So it's been so far fetched. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=63.2s)]
*  It's like a tragic comedy, especially sadly for our family, for the Royals. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=65.68s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=71.28s)]
*  Well, she does seem to have left quite a trail of destruction in her wake, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=73.12s)]
*  but she also has, as you pointed out in your first sentence, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=76.48s)]
*  a hundred million dollar PR machine on her side telling her story in soft focus. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=80.4s)]
*  What's it like to be up against that? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's been on continuum. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=91.04s)]
*  I mean, I found out from an attorney in London that there was an entrenched media agenda [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=93.04s)]
*  against me back in 2018. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  So on continuum, there's been, you know, this series of fake news stories and I couldn't [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  fight it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=106.32s)]
*  Let's face it, you know, companies like Sunshine Sachs that are powerhouses are really powerful. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=106.72s)]
*  And so is the printed word. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=112.96s)]
*  We didn't know how we were going to deal with it until, you know, like they say, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  water seeks its own level. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  Eventually the truth comes out and when it does and when the dust settles, I thought, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=122.24s)]
*  you know, truth has to stand for something. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=126.8s)]
*  Truth wins. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=129.84s)]
*  So here we are. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  She's been able to keep the truth at bay. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=134.32s)]
*  This is my read by accusing anyone who asks questions or criticizes her of racism. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=136.56s)]
*  Has she called you a racist yet? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=143.28s)]
*  Her sister? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  No, there were some weird PR stories in the beginning that alluded to that, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=147.76s)]
*  but that's not realistic. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=151.76s)]
*  We were an interracial family. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=152.88s)]
*  And I think, you know, if we all look back when they were the fab four, when they were, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=154.88s)]
*  you know, jet setting, when we looked at that incredible multicultural wedding and then [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=160.08s)]
*  Prince Charles had paid for and chosen the choir and the bishop, I heard. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  So there wasn't any racism there until a point at which they began being criticized for making [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=172.72000000000003s)]
*  Hollywood deals while they were working royals. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, if you work at McDonald's, anywhere you work, there is prohibited conduct. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=181.36s)]
*  There are rules. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  There are boundaries. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=189.2s)]
*  And it seems to me that they, you know, got into their position. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=190.88s)]
*  They had a lot of fun. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=194.56s)]
*  They love the accolades and the perks. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=196.0s)]
*  But when it came time to being accountable and being responsible and following rules, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=198.64s)]
*  that seems to be when everything fell apart. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=203.76s)]
*  And that's life. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  So I don't believe the racism, you know, the race card, the victim card. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=208.0s)]
*  Wah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=212.64s)]
*  Somebody call the Whambulance. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=213.44s)]
*  It's just not, it's just not real. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=214.72s)]
*  Someone call the Whambulance. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=217.68s)]
*  Okay, I'm stealing that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=219.68s)]
*  Last question. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=222.8s)]
*  Would you have any advice for her in-laws? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=223.36s)]
*  She's married into this big and storied family and seems to have disrupted it pretty profoundly. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=226.72s)]
*  What would you counsel them? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=232.08s)]
*  In my honest opinion, you know, I think apathy in a situation like this, when you're dealing with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=236.96s)]
*  someone who appears to lack empathy, remorse and shame, I think being empathetic can be a dangerous [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=243.44s)]
*  thing and so can apathy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=251.44s)]
*  I think he needs to act, you know, certainly swiftly and severely and lay down the boundaries [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=253.2s)]
*  because they seem to not like boundaries. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=260.88s)]
*  And I think it sets a dangerous precedent to let this go on. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=263.84s)]
*  I think that's wise advice really for any family. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=268.96s)]
*  Samantha Markle, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=271.6s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Wz9vZNedg&t=273.44s)]
