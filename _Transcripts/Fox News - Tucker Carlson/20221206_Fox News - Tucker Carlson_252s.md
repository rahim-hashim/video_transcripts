# Miranda Devine: It was obvious 'Twitter Files' were missing a crucial element
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0)
*  So we told you on Friday about the internal documents from Twitter that Elon Musk released [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=0.0s)]
*  gave to Matt Taibbi who wrote about them and then they told us, Taibbi and Musk said that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  this is just the first batch, you're going to get a lot more in days to come over the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  weekend than yesterday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=16.54s)]
*  But they never came. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=17.6s)]
*  That's kind of weird. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=18.6s)]
*  The deadline came and went. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=20.82s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=22.46s)]
*  Well we learned today what happened. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=23.46s)]
*  This weekend, Matt Taibbi and Barry Weiss who's helping him do this reporting found out that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  the general counsel of Twitter, that would be the former FBI general counsel James Baker [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=29.94s)]
*  had been vetting the documents before Taibbi and Weiss could see them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=34.78s)]
*  In other words, removing the ones that might incriminate him or the feds. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=39.28s)]
*  Apparently even Elon Musk who owns Twitter didn't know this was happening. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Now keep in mind, in case you're looking for evidence of sinister intent, this same Jim [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=47.92s)]
*  Baker was one of the architects of the Russia collusion hoax in 2016. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=52.5s)]
*  This is the guy who obtained the fraudulent FISA warrants and targeted Michael Flynn, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=56.36s)]
*  for example. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  So this afternoon, Elon Musk fired Baker from Twitter. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=61.9s)]
*  Quote, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=65.0s)]
*  In light of concerns about Baker's possible role in suppression of information important [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=66.0s)]
*  to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=70.12s)]
*  An amazing story that just happened. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=74.18s)]
*  So to make sense of it, we are happy to be joined by Miranda Devine of the New York Post [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=76.68s)]
*  who's been at the center of the story for over two years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=80.38s)]
*  Miranda, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=83.02s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=84.82s)]
*  Hi, Tucker. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, as you and I discussed on Friday night, it was pretty obvious that the Twitter [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  files that had just been released were missing a crucial element and that was the FBI. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=94.64s)]
*  So we surmised that somehow Elon Musk had redacted it or someone had withheld the information [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  about the FBI's intervention. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=110.06s)]
*  May I ask you to pause right there, Miranda? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=111.06s)]
*  Miranda, you were the only person who said that, actually. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't me, it was you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  You were the first person who took a look at those documents and you said someone has [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  taken out the incriminating stuff. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  And I think you were the only person to catch that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=124.24s)]
*  So I just think you deserve credit for it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=126.88s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=129.04s)]
*  Well, so the FBI, we knew had pre-bunked to the social media platforms our story. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=130.04s)]
*  Before it came out, they told them to expect a pile of Russian disinformation and Twitter [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=139.10000000000002s)]
*  was told by the FBI, we know from Yol Roth, to expect that it would be in October and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=145.68s)]
*  would probably refer to Hunter Biden. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  So we knew that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=153.36s)]
*  There had to be something about that at Twitter and yet there wasn't in the Twitter files. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=154.36s)]
*  And it was pretty obvious who was suppressing that information, who was the person with [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=159.66000000000003s)]
*  the biggest motive. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  It was Twitter's top lawyer, James Baker, who, as you just said, had been the top lawyer [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=165.58s)]
*  at the FBI, the quarterback of the FBI Russia collusion scandal. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  And he had had to leave the FBI because of that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  And lo and behold, he shows up at Twitter five months before the 2020 election. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=183.46s)]
*  And lo and behold, one little element did come out in the Twitter files Friday night. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  It was this one email that had the date and time removed from it, very peculiarly, but [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=193.86s)]
*  it was from James Baker and it was weighing in on the decision on the morning of October [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=200.68s)]
*  14, 2020, a few hours after our story came out. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=206.12s)]
*  And there was James Baker weighing in on the side of censorship, no surprise. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=211.06s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=217.34s)]
*  And as you said at the very outset, this is not just a story about free speech on social [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=218.84s)]
*  media. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=222.6s)]
*  This is a story about the corruption of the FBI, federal law enforcement. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=223.6s)]
*  And you were absolutely right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=226.92s)]
*  Miranda Divine vindicated once again. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=228.56s)]
*  And Tucker, look, Elon Musk needs to let all the information out, let us all see it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=230.04s)]
*  No more of this curating and holding back. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=236.0s)]
*  No, it's ridiculous. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=240.32s)]
*  Thank you, Miranda. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCbvw5MEw0&t=241.32s)]
