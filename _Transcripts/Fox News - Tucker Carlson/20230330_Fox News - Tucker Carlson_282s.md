# Tucker: This is wrong
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs)
*  The neoliberal establishment has decided [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=0.0s)]
*  it can't win arguments. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=2.24s)]
*  Nobody wants what they're selling at all. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=4.54s)]
*  So why even bother to convince anybody? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=7.32s)]
*  So instead they're going right to force [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=9.72s)]
*  and you're seeing that all over our country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=11.3s)]
*  And one of the ways they're inflicting force on people, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=13.16s)]
*  inflicting pain, is through civil suits. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=15.76s)]
*  Bring them to civil court, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=18.04s)]
*  because anyone can file a lawsuit. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=19.12s)]
*  And so there are a lot of well-funded lawsuits [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=21.16s)]
*  trying to shut people up or punish them [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=23.48s)]
*  for stepping out of line. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=26.22s)]
*  And here's the latest example. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=27.32s)]
*  This has not gotten enough coverage. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=28.84s)]
*  So Tara Reid once worked for Joe Biden. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=30.44s)]
*  He sexually assaulted her, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=33.08s)]
*  and she made possibly the mistake of saying so out loud. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=35.38s)]
*  You're not allowed to do that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=38.28s)]
*  So in retaliation against her, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=39.68s)]
*  the New York Times posted her social security number [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  on her website. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=43.58s)]
*  Can you imagine the ramifications of that? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=44.42s)]
*  So Tara Reid sued the New York Times [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=46.58s)]
*  because you can't put people's social security numbers [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=48.44s)]
*  on a website. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=51.32s)]
*  But a federal judge has now ruled against Tara Reid [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=53.24s)]
*  and said that she has to pay the legal fees [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=56.260000000000005s)]
*  of the New York Times. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=58.38s)]
*  So they're still trying to crush her. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  And we think it's wrong. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=63.34s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=65.18s)]
*  Did I misstate any of that? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=67.06s)]
*  I mean, it seems like you came out [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=68.58s)]
*  and accused the sitting president of a sex crime, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=70.5s)]
*  and we've spoken a great length about this on the air, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=72.76s)]
*  and I don't think there's any question that it happened. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=75.0s)]
*  You said so at the time, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=77.1s)]
*  and now they're trying to hurt you for saying that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=78.94s)]
*  That's what it looks like to me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=80.7s)]
*  Yes, this is just one of the many things that they've done [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=83.58s)]
*  to try to silence me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  But yeah, the lawsuit that I filed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=89.06s)]
*  was because on the first story that they did, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  the New York Times, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=93.69999999999999s)]
*  and they used me as basically a whipping post all of 2020 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  to try to silence and discredit me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=98.22s)]
*  But the first story was on Easter Sunday, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  and I was woken up very early in the morning [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=102.06s)]
*  by a friend who lived back East and said, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  hey, the online story on New York Times [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  has your congressional ID [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=107.58s)]
*  showing your social security number. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=109.89999999999999s)]
*  We need to get it down. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=111.69999999999999s)]
*  It took a few hours, we got it down, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=112.82s)]
*  and they did comply with taking it down, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=114.58s)]
*  but it was very awful. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=117.8s)]
*  So I did try to file a lawsuit. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  I lost, the judge ruled that it was in the public interest [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=121.6s)]
*  to print it, and I then was slapped with attorney's fees [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  from New York Times upwards close to over $71,000. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=129.88s)]
*  So you were not a rich person, I know, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=136.16s)]
*  from our conversations. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=138.12s)]
*  So just two quick questions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=140.64s)]
*  How was it in the public's interest for the New York Times [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=142.24s)]
*  to publish your social security number of all private things? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=144.84s)]
*  Well, suddenly, I guess there was a great interest [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=149.56s)]
*  in freedom of speech, so, and freedom of the press. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=151.96s)]
*  So freedom of the press would be the impetus for that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  and sort of a more of a legal argument. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=157.52s)]
*  And I don't wanna bore your audience with all of that, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=160.44s)]
*  but there's been different ways that the, you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  Biden administration has come after me. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=166.44s)]
*  They've come after me with the DOJ, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=168.08s)]
*  with sealed warrants on my Twitter, which are of record, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=169.6s)]
*  and there's been, you know, a little bit of press about that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=172.6s)]
*  They took my communications on Twitter and all of that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=176.64s)]
*  So yeah, it's been, you know, watching Joe Biden [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=180.0s)]
*  take a wrecking ball to my, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=183.56s)]
*  I've been experiencing this wrecking ball to my life, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=184.76s)]
*  but now I've been watching the last couple of years [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  take a wrecking ball to the United States, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  including, you know, the proxy war that Russia [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  and that NATO and US is fighting against Russia, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=194.16s)]
*  and upwards of $100 billion going over there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=199.16s)]
*  When we have dire circumstances here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=201.6s)]
*  So all of those things that I talked about [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=204.04s)]
*  that I criticized Joe Biden about, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=206.4s)]
*  besides the awful experience [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=208.76s)]
*  of being sexually assaulted by him [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=210.76s)]
*  when I was a Senate staffer in 1993, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=212.6s)]
*  you know, people are seeing just the true Joe Biden [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=215.8s)]
*  of how corrupt this regime is. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=219.56s)]
*  And if there needs to be any regime change, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=222.36s)]
*  it doesn't need to be in other countries. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=224.56s)]
*  It needs to happen here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=225.96s)]
*  Now, so. I agree. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=227.4s)]
*  We're seeing how cruel and ruthless they are. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=229.52s)]
*  And not only they don't believe all women, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  they will hurt women who disobey. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=234.56s)]
*  And you're a perfect example. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=236.44s)]
*  And further, Tucker, you know, the New York Times has become, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  the legacy media has become like an arm [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=240.24s)]
*  of the Biden administration, like the DOJ and the FBI. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=242.12s)]
*  I mean, look at what just happened to Matt Taibbi [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  who testified about, you know, the different ways [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  that they were trying to suppress US citizen speech [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  and using taxpayer money to do it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=252.24s)]
*  and control the conversation and control the narrative. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=254.88s)]
*  He got visited by an IRS agent. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=257.32s)]
*  The day of his testimony. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=259.04s)]
*  So, you know. They send the IRS to your house. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=260.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm not. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=262.6s)]
*  We're all waiting for that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=264.64000000000004s)]
*  And I know that you are, you're living it now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=265.6s)]
*  Terri, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=267.6s)]
*  I appreciate it. Thank you for having me. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC1sZY6zfbs&t=269.08000000000004s)]
