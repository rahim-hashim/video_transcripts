# Will Cain: We found a real-life Forrest Gump
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ)
*  Well, Forrest Gump just kept going and going for quote, no particular reason. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  But now we have a real life Forrest Gump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=4.32s)]
*  I hope he's not offended by that characterization because he has an actual honorable reason that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=7.12s)]
*  he walked coast to coast. His name is Tommy Pasquale and he just went from the Atlantic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=12.96s)]
*  to the Pacific 3000 miles. It took him 143 days and he said along the way he quote, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=17.04s)]
*  listen to country music, Bruce Springsteen classics and the Will Kane podcast. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=23.28s)]
*  He did it to raise money and awareness for the many homeless veterans in this country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=27.92s)]
*  Tommy Pasquale joins us now to tell us about it. So I think the entire country is wondering about [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=32.24s)]
*  your entertainment choices out there in the middle of the country. No one but Bruce Springsteen and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=37.52s)]
*  Will Kane. Right. I knew you'd like that. Yeah. Only the classics. That's right. American icons, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  if you will. Right. Tommy, tell us first of all, your inspiration to walk from the Atlantic to the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  Pacific. Yeah. So it was a goal of mine for the past few years to do something special like this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  And with that, I knew that I wanted to pair it with a really worthy charity. So I teamed up with [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans trying to get these brave men and women who have [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=67.44s)]
*  served our country so valiantly off the streets. It just doesn't sit right with me that on any given [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=72.16s)]
*  night, 38,000 veterans go to sleep homeless in this country. And you raised almost $100,000 so far. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=77.2s)]
*  Many people watching right now can help contribute. I'm sure. Correct. How could they do that? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=83.52s)]
*  Yes. So you can do it two ways. One, you go directly to the National Coalition for Homeless [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=87.2s)]
*  Veterans website, donate directly there and check out all the great work that they're doing. Or you [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=92.32s)]
*  could go straight to my Instagram, Tommy underscore walks underscore America. And in my bio, I have a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=97.36s)]
*  link to a GoFundMe where you can donate there as well. What a cause, what a purpose. Different than [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=103.36s)]
*  Forrest Gump to actually help America's homeless veterans. Now let's talk about the walk. 143 days. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you, I guess the most open ended question I can, but what was it like? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=114.32s)]
*  It was tough. It was definitely the toughest thing I've ever done. But I would say overall, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=118.88s)]
*  it was a great experience. I'm really happy I did it. And I can honestly say with a straight face, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=122.88s)]
*  I'm very happy it's over as well. What was the scariest moment? There was a lot of scary moments, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=127.52s)]
*  just, you know, living in a tent with the elements out there, you know, hearing some [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=132.16s)]
*  coyotes in the distance and just the wind whipping against the tent. I thought, you know, there was [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=136.88s)]
*  times where I thought I'd never see home again, but it made it through. How's the body? How did [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=141.84s)]
*  you feel after walking for 3000 miles in 143 days? You know, it was, it was painful, but you know, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=146.32s)]
*  like I always say to everyone who asks, you know, I was hurting the whole way, but I wasn't injured. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=151.84s)]
*  And as long as I'm hurting and not injured, I could still play through it. Tommy and I feel like we [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  know each other because he's listened to the Will Kane podcast. And I've said on numerous occasions, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=161.36s)]
*  I want to do something like what you've done here. I've wanted to canoe the Lewis and Clark [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=165.04s)]
*  path through the Missouri river or ride a cattle trail from Texas to Montana. But what you've just [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=169.68s)]
*  done, I think is a bucket list check item for many, many people out there in America to walk [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  this country. And you did it for a purpose to help other Americans. And I know that I, for one, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=178.4s)]
*  I think most of America appreciates that about you, Tommy Pascual. He's going to be on the Will [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=182.56s)]
*  Kane podcast this coming, we're going to go a little more into depth about what those nights, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  what those days were like, but we're proud of you and we really appreciate you being with us tonight. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=191.84s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me on Will. All right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTt_AsqgDQ&t=195.36s)]
