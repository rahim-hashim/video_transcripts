# Tucker: Our assumptions were wrong
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4)
*  So we haven't watched a ton of cable news recently, but we assumed with mass layoffs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=0.0s)]
*  underway across the U.S. economy and egg shortage, crumbling cities, the prospect of a third [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=4.88s)]
*  world war looming on the near horizon, we assumed we knew what the other channels would be covering [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=10.16s)]
*  because there are an awful lot of threats out there. What we didn't know until we tuned into [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=16.0s)]
*  MSNBC and CNN the other day was that all of those threats go by a single name, and that name is Mr. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=21.12s)]
*  George Santos. George Santos. Weeks into his new job as a freshman member of Congress and just months [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=28.72s)]
*  from his previous life of near total anonymity, George Santos has somehow transformed into the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=35.92s)]
*  single most dangerous and historically significant figure on the global stage today. George Santos [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=42.08s)]
*  is like 9-11 in human form. Nothing will ever be the same now that George Santos is here. You will [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  never forget the moment you first saw George Santos. Where were you when George Santos was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=54.72s)]
*  elected? It's a story you will tell your grandchildren. Watch. On Capitol Hill, this is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=59.12s)]
*  George Santos's reality. It seems almost every day there are new questions about the freshman [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=65.92s)]
*  congressman's past, some stretching back more than a decade. Can you keep up with all the Santos lies [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=71.36s)]
*  and controversies? He is now out-Trumping Trump in terms of flooding the zone with excrement. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=79.12s)]
*  Not just saying that he played volleyball, but he had a scholarship that he slayed teams from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=84.64s)]
*  Harvard and Yale. A perfect portrayal of self-loathing that he clearly is so disgusted with himself and so [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=88.56s)]
*  disgusted with the life that he's led, a life of lies, a life of fables. People didn't decide [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  because they thought he was somebody totally, totally different. It was a lie and a fraudulent [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=103.04s)]
*  election. He has to resign. Not a volleyball champion and he doesn't appear to be a champion [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=108.0s)]
*  of the people either. The voters did not elect you, Mr. Santos. They elected a version of you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=112.32s)]
*  invented by your imagination. Sadly, George Santos represents so much that is wrong today. Lies, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=118.8s)]
*  denial, and the death of shame. It was a stolen election. It was a stolen election. You heard [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=124.48s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger say it and CNN filled in the blanks. It's not just that George Santos claimed [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=133.04s)]
*  that he once played volleyball in college, played volleyball in college. It's worse than that, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  indescribably worse. George Santos told other people out loud and CNN can exclusively confirm [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  this, that he had a volleyball scholarship, perhaps the most coveted credential in collegiate sports, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=152.32s)]
*  but he didn't. It was all a facade. It was a tissue of lies constructed to deceive the American [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=161.04s)]
*  people. There was no volleyball scholarship. There was not a single dollar of volleyball [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=168.4s)]
*  scholarship. George Santos made it all up out of whole cloth, out of thin air. George Santos [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=174.64s)]
*  is an ersatz volleyball player, a fraud, a ghoul. People voted for this man believing he had played [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=183.12s)]
*  collegiate volleyball on a scholarship and he hadn't. And yet tonight, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=192.16s)]
*  this thief of volleyball glory strides the halls of the United States Congress unimpeded [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=199.6s)]
*  by law enforcement. It's like another insurrection. And by the way, we are hearing tonight, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=206.96s)]
*  we can't confirm this, but we'll continue our investigation in George Santos, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=213.36s)]
*  there are reports tonight that he did not actually work at Citibank. He did not work at Citibank. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=217.52s)]
*  No volleyball scholarship, never worked at Citibank. What percentage of the people who voted for George [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=224.96s)]
*  Santos under false pretenses would have done so had they known he never played volleyball and never [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=231.12s)]
*  worked at Citibank. We can only guess, obviously a very small percentage. Subscribe to the Fox News [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=236.64s)]
*  YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are changing the world and changing your life [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=242.32s)]
*  from Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJplVTlD5m4&t=248.88s)]
