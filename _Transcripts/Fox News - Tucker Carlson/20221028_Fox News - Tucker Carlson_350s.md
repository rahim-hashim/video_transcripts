# Father and daughter speak out after trans female changed in girls' locker room
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU)
*  So one of the reasons parents put up with this is anyone who says anything is instantly punished. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=0.0s)]
*  Travis Allen learned that the hard way. He was a girls soccer coach at Randolph [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=4.72s)]
*  Union Middle School in Vermont. He was just suspended from his job without pay because [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=8.32s)]
*  he complained about a male student looming around the girls locker room. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Then the school, because this is North Korea at this point, punished Travis Allen's daughter, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=17.92s)]
*  Blake Allen, for speaking about it too. Blake Allen was on the volleyball team. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=21.84s)]
*  Blake Allen and Travis Allen join us tonight. We're going to talk to our lawyer in just a moment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Thank you both so much for coming on. Travis, first to you, did I misstate what happened? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=30.08s)]
*  You complained about a man in the women's locker room and you were punished? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=36.08s)]
*  Correct. I made a social media post that referred to the male student as a male and I was punished [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=41.28s)]
*  because I misgendered him. You lost your job or you're suspended without pay from your job? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=49.28s)]
*  Correct. As the soccer coach. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=54.64s)]
*  So you were the creep in this. I have to ask, did other employees at the school take you aside and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=59.36s)]
*  say we're on your side? Did anyone protest your suspension? None of the other employees did. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=64.64s)]
*  Other community members have supported me though privately. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=71.36s)]
*  It's beyond belief. Thank you for complaining by the way, at very least. Blake Allen, what did you [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=76.16s)]
*  do wrong in the eyes of the school and how were you punished? I was in the locker room and the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=82.24s)]
*  trans student walked in and there was, the rest of the team was in there and we were, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=88.08s)]
*  I was really uncomfortable and I left and I told the school and they just shut me down and said [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  there's nothing they could do and I was later suspended because I voiced my opinion that a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=99.36s)]
*  male shouldn't be in the women's locker room and then when we filed a lawsuit they dropped the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=104.88s)]
*  suspension. How old are you? How old were you when this happened? I'm 14. I'm a freshman. You're 14 [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=110.16s)]
*  years old and when you complained about a dude in the girls locker room you got suspended? Yes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=118.08s)]
*  Who's, can you tell us the name of the person who made that decision? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=124.96s)]
*  Lane Millington. Yeah and how was, how did this adult communicate your suspension to you? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=129.84s)]
*  What did you do wrong in the view of this adult? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  I think they were mad that I was telling people how I thought it was wrong and that a male [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  shouldn't be allowed to be with us in the locker room. You're 14 years old. Tell us what your [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  classmates thought. Were they on your side? Yeah, a lot of my classmates were supportive. I think [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  most people in the school are. They're just too scared to speak up because they see all the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=162.88s)]
*  backlash I'm getting for it. Well you're very brave. Because not only was I suspended, thank you, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=166.32s)]
*  I'm supposed to do, I was going to do a restorative justice circle and write a letter of apology. To [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=173.76s)]
*  whom? To the dude? The trans student. To the to the boy who was in the girls locker room? Yes. You [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=180.56s)]
*  have to write a letter of apology. I said I would rather have a five-day suspension than have to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=187.68s)]
*  apologize because I'm not sorry for stating my opinion. How old was the boy? 14. 14. What are [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=191.28s)]
*  you going to do? Are you going to continue with the school? Yeah, for now. It's all so unbelievable. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=205.6s)]
*  It really is. And it's only when people like you, Travis Allen and Blake Allen, take the lumps, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=214.72s)]
*  stand up, tell the truth for just basic, basic human rights like the right to change without [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=220.72s)]
*  some guy staring at you. It's only when you do that that things get better. So I appreciate that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=227.76s)]
*  you both did and that you're willing to talk on this show. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for having [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=231.84s)]
*  us. I want to go now to your lawyer, Tyson Langhofer, who serves at Senior Counsel at [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=236.16s)]
*  Alliance Defending Freedom. Tyson, thanks for coming on. What is the case that you're making [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=240.32s)]
*  at the on behalf of these two? Sure. Well, the school district, they retaliated against both Blake [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=247.36s)]
*  and Travis for just simply stating their views. And First Amendment retaliation is a, you know, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=258.32s)]
*  prohibited by the Constitution. I mean, that's very clear that the government cannot retaliate [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=265.36s)]
*  against individuals simply for sharing their views. I mean, the crazy thing about this, Tucker, is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=269.68s)]
*  that Blake understands this issue. She doesn't need to be reeducated. Males are males, females are [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=273.84s)]
*  females. And Blake shouldn't be forced to change in front of a male or watch a male change, but [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=280.0s)]
*  that's what they're forcing her to do. And they're trying to force their ideology down everybody's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  throat and then punish anybody that has a different viewpoint. That's unconstitutional. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=289.12s)]
*  Well, I thought they cared about girls too. 14 year old girls don't have a right to get dressed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  without a boy watching. I mean, is anyone standing up for girls? I mean, I'm hardly a feminist, but [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  what? Where are all the feminist groups? Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, and then that's the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=303.76s)]
*  really sad thing is when a father comes and says, hey, who's standing up for my daughter? He gets [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=310.8s)]
*  punished. He loses his job. He's suspended without pay for simply saying, hey, what about my daughter? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  You don't know. Well, the sad thing is, is all the other fathers who didn't do that, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=322.48s)]
*  who are cowering like the cowards they are in their homes and letting this happen to their girls [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=326.08s)]
*  without fighting back. They should feel deep shame and I hope they do. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=330.88s)]
*  And I appreciate your coming on tonight. Tyson Langhofer. Thank you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=334.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXjVReeguU&t=338.71999999999997s)]
