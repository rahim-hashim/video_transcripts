# Cain: After Trump raid, we're seeing what a permanent national split looks like
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. I'm Will Cain, in for Tucker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=0.0s)]
*  A day after the FBI's raid on former President Donald Trump, we're starting to see what a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=4.5s)]
*  permanent national split looks like. A divorce. Nobody wants to say it out loud, but it's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=10.44s)]
*  true. And this is not simply a break between Democrats and Republicans. No, that's too [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=16.32s)]
*  simple. What we're seeing is divide between people who are willing to use the power of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=21.36s)]
*  the state to silence their opponents and those who are unwilling. What's held this country [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=26.76s)]
*  together since the Civil War? It's not the federal code. It's not even the Bill of Rights, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=32.36s)]
*  as important as that document is. Remember, the Soviet Union had a Bill of Rights. It [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  guaranteed freedom of speech and equal rights. But in practice, the Bolsheviks assassinated [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=42.44s)]
*  their political opponents and sent their dissidents to the gulags. As Beria boasted, show me the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=47.8s)]
*  man, I'll show you the crime. Now, what's kept us functioning through the centuries where the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=52.76s)]
*  Bolsheviks failed is that our Constitution separated powers and prevented a uniparty. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=57.92s)]
*  We've also had an unwritten understanding that state power will not be used, shall not be used, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=64.84s)]
*  for improper political purposes. The law must be enforced equally without political considerations. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=70.68s)]
*  And once you lose that common understanding, it's mutually assured destruction. No one has [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=77.6s)]
*  any reason to uphold the system, so the system will collapse. The late Antonin Scalia made this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  point back in October of 2011, speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It's one of the most [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=90.28s)]
*  important videos you can watch, and here it is. The response I will get, and you will get this from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=96.28s)]
*  almost any American, including the woman that he was talking to at the supermarket, the answer would [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  be freedom of speech, freedom of the press, no unreasonable searches and seizures, no quartering [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=108.12s)]
*  of troops in hope, those marvelous provisions of the Bill of Rights. But then I tell them, if you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=115.56s)]
*  think that a Bill of Rights is what sets us apart, you're crazy. Every banana republic in the world [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=122.44s)]
*  has a Bill of Rights, just words on paper, what our framers would have called a parchment guarantee. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=130.84s)]
*  And the reason is that the real constitution of the Soviet Union, you think of the word [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=138.2s)]
*  constitution, it doesn't mean a bill, it means structure. Say a person has a sound constitution, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=144.84s)]
*  here's a sound structure. The real constitution of the Soviet Union, which is what our framers [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=149.88s)]
*  debated that whole summer in Philadelphia in 1787, they didn't talk about the Bill of Rights. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=156.36s)]
*  That was an afterthought, wasn't it? That constitution of the Soviet Union did not prevent [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=161.96s)]
*  the centralization of power in one person or in one party. And when that happens, the game is over, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=168.84s)]
*  the Bill of Rights is just what our framers would call a parchment guarantee. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  The game is over, a parchment guarantee. Most Americans now, by the way, in both parties, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=183.24s)]
*  believe we're living in a banana republic that was just described by Scalia. The Trafalgar Group [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=190.12s)]
*  recently found that 79% of Americans believe the justice system protects political insiders. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=195.16s)]
*  Two-thirds of Democrats believe that. And it's not hard to see why. The president's son can commit [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=201.08s)]
*  multiple felonies, prostitution, corruption, and the federal authorities will just ignore them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=207.48s)]
*  In fact, they'll call them Russian disinformation. A sitting member of Congress can share bodily [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=212.28s)]
*  fluids and potentially classified materials, presumably not one and the same, with a Chinese [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  spy and no one in the FBI or the media will say a word. Millions of migrants can illegally cross [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  the border, and you're not supposed to notice. But when the president's home is raided for the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  first time in American history, those very same cable news propagandists will celebrate it as a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=236.2s)]
*  win for the rule of law. What's in that warrant that authorized this raid, exactly? And why was [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=241.4s)]
*  a low-level magistrate judge, an Obama donor, who defended Jeffrey Epstein's associates, the one who [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=249.32s)]
*  approved the warrant? They don't care about any of this. They're just happy that Donald Trump was [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=255.8s)]
*  targeted. Attorney General Merrick Garland has said in recent weeks, more than once, that no one is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  above the law, including anyone who happened to be president. An ex-president is not above the law. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=266.28s)]
*  There is no person in this country who's above the law. In America, nobody is above the law. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=272.76s)]
*  No one is above the law. No one is above the law. No one is above the law, not even a president or [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=278.52s)]
*  a former president of the United States. No one is above the law except for Swalwell and Clinton [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  and Hunter Biden. They're mocking you, just as Barria mocked his victims. We've been building [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=290.76s)]
*  to this moment for quite some time. For the last four years, anyone who challenged permanent [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  Washington has been targeted by the FBI. They've been waking up to pre-dawn SWAT team raids [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=301.24s)]
*  with CNN in tow. They're getting criminally charged and bankrupted, not because they committed any crimes, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=306.68s)]
*  but because the FBI wanted them silenced. Before the FBI's interview, you remember this story [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=313.32s)]
*  of Michael Flynn at the White House in 2017, the FBI's director of counterintelligence, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=319.72s)]
*  Bill Priestap. He authored a handwritten note about his plan to entrap Flynn. Quote, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  what is our goal, Priestap wrote? Truth, admission, or get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  him fired. We all know then what happened next. According to a partisan FBI agent named Peter [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=336.04s)]
*  Strzok, he's not the most impartial of sources, Flynn told agents he wasn't sure if he talked [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=343.0s)]
*  about sanctions with a Russian ambassador. That's it. Now keep in mind, talking about sanctions with [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=349.32s)]
*  a foreign country is legal and expected when you're the national security advisor. But for that, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=354.76s)]
*  the FBI ruined Michael Flynn. He had to sell his home. And where's Bill Priestap? Collecting a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=361.56s)]
*  government pension. No raid, no jail. The same is true, by the way, for Kevin Kleinsmith. You [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=367.08s)]
*  remember him? He's the FBI lawyer who falsified a FISA warrant application to secure the wiretap on [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=373.4s)]
*  Flynn. He admitted it. He didn't spend any days in jail, not one day in jail. He wasn't even disbarred [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=380.44s)]
*  from being an attorney. And as for Jim Comey, the FBI director at the time, well, he bragged about the FBI. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  Something I probably wouldn't have done or maybe gotten away with in a more organized investigation, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  a more organized administration, I thought it's early enough. Let's just send a couple guys over. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=409.4s)]
*  And so we placed a call to Flynn, said, hey, we're sending a couple guys over. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=416.84s)]
*  Hope you'll talk to them. He said, sure. Nobody else was there. They interviewed him in a [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=424.52s)]
*  conference room at the White House Situation Room and he lied to them. And that's what he's now [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=429.48s)]
*  pled guilty to. What did he think they were coming over there for? I don't think he knew. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=433.64000000000004s)]
*  I know we didn't tell him. To them, it's comedy. To Americans is a banana republic. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=441.8s)]
*  Declassified documents, of course, prove that the FBI knew the Clinton campaign invented many of the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=447.8s)]
*  Russia collusion allegations that were the pretext for the entire Russian administration to be [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=452.76s)]
*  arrested. But the FBI is not the only one that's been arrested. We've had a lot of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=457.56s)]
*  incidents that were the pretext for the entire probe. James Comey went ahead with that comedy, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  with that banana republic action anyway. That's because what we've had for years is an FBI that's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  interested in really one mission, and that is eliminating rivals of the Uniparty and Permanent [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=474.6s)]
*  Washington. As with the Bolsheviks, they use pretext to get what they want. Last night's raid [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=481.0s)]
*  can be dealt with as would be in these office projects and they should have their own [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=487.56s)]
*  president Sorensen to consider too. The sóitters we had ahead the year of절 in the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=490.12s)]
*  U.S. agent officer's office apparently showed no bad intentions. But in our [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=494.35999999999996s)]
*  uses of materials, you can handle missing records with a subpoena. You don't come kicking the doors [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  in and blow opening safes. And that's why the Feds never raided the home of Sandy Burger, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=506.91999999999996s)]
*  who literally shoved classified documents in his socks. Or Hillary Clinton's [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=511.79999999999995s)]
*  Everyone knows what this was really about. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=515.56s)]
*  Finding something, anything, they can use to keep Donald Trump from running for president. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=518.06s)]
*  Now, here is the interesting question. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=523.9599999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=526.16s)]
*  Well, he's a threat to the entrenched, unelected power in Washington, the biggest threat ever faced. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=527.3599999999999s)]
*  From the beginning, Donald Trump was an outsider, but not just an outsider. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=534.66s)]
*  An outsider that declared war on the military-industrial complex. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=538.16s)]
*  He stopped buying their weapons and sending them to Ukraine, so they impeached Trump. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=541.5600000000001s)]
*  As Axios reported just two weeks ago, Donald Trump plans to gut the federal bureaucracy [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  if he's re-elected in 2024. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  Taking a butcher knife to the administrative state. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=555.16s)]
*  That means eliminating career government employees installed by Barack Obama. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=557.86s)]
*  And nothing terrifies a career bureaucrat more than losing their grip on power. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=562.96s)]
*  Look, on the one hand, some politicians in both parties do appear to recognize this threat. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=568.96s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for example, is calling this raid a sign that we're now living in, quote, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=575.26s)]
*  a banana republic. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  And Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who's no stranger to the damage of open-ended investigations, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=581.1600000000001s)]
*  just called the raid a major threat to the credibility of the FBI. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=587.0600000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, the Republican's leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, waited 24 hours [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=591.6600000000001s)]
*  before he demanded answers from the FBI. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=596.96s)]
*  Tim Scott of South Carolina says we need to wait and let the process play out. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=599.0600000000001s)]
*  John Cornyn sent out a few retweets. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=602.66s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy calling for reforms. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=605.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=608.26s)]
*  How do you reform this? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=609.36s)]
*  This is the FBI director on August 4th. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=612.0600000000001s)]
*  Do you agree that the allegation of secret collusion between President Trump and Russia was a hoax? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=624.66s)]
*  I don't think that's the terminology I would use, but I think there's been a lot written on this subject [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=627.66s)]
*  both in the special counsel's report, the inspector general's report. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=632.96s)]
*  Just say no is fine. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=636.46s)]
*  So that's not a term I would use. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=637.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=639.26s)]
*  Do you agree that the Hunter Biden laptop was not Russia disinformation? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=640.46s)]
*  Now you're asking about an ongoing investigation that I expect our folks to pursue aggressively, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  and I just can't comment on that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=654.16s)]
*  Okay, and you possess the laptop, right? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=655.56s)]
*  Again, I can't discuss that ongoing investigation. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=657.76s)]
*  You know, many people like to point out that Christopher Wray was appointed by Trump. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=662.3599999999999s)]
*  Christopher Wray is a member of permanent Washington who doesn't like to discuss anything, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=666.26s)]
*  including why his agents concocted a plan to kidnap the governor of Michigan, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=671.9599999999999s)]
*  or how many FBI agents were active on January 6th. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=675.8599999999999s)]
*  The FBI gets away with all this because they are permanent fixtures in Washington, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=678.76s)]
*  as is your national media. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=683.26s)]
*  Andy McCabe is always on CNN these days. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=686.36s)]
*  Peter Strzok and John Brennan and James Clapper, regular fixtures on MSNBC. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=689.16s)]
*  So was former FBI counterintelligence official Frank Fugalizzi. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=694.06s)]
*  Watch this revealing moment from last night. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=698.66s)]
*  Fugalizzi informs MSNBC producers that the term raid is a little strong. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=702.26s)]
*  So MSNBC changed the chyron in real time to obey his command. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=708.66s)]
*  Agents, by the way, don't like the word raid. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=714.3599999999999s)]
*  They don't like it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=716.8599999999999s)]
*  It sounds like it's some kind of, you know, extrajudicial, non-legal thing. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=717.9599999999999s)]
*  It's the execution of a search warrant. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=723.06s)]
*  It's a court authorized search warrant. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=724.76s)]
*  The takeaway here is not that the media is biased, you know that, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=728.4599999999999s)]
*  or that the FBI should prosecute Hunter Biden for, as in the famous words of Stephen A. Smith, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=731.26s)]
*  smoking crack. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=736.0600000000001s)]
*  You know that as well. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=738.1600000000001s)]
*  We're not calling on the FBI to raid Eric Swalwell, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=739.6600000000001s)]
*  even though he's been sleeping with Fang Fang, the Chinese spy. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=742.36s)]
*  What we're saying is that if the Biden administration doesn't immediately take steps [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=745.46s)]
*  to dismantle this uniparty, to stop the FBI's corruption, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=749.96s)]
*  to take down permanent Washington, to terminate Christopher Wray and Merrick Garland, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=753.6600000000001s)]
*  for starters, then these kind of raids will not end. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=757.6600000000001s)]
*  Republicans will eventually take power, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=761.6600000000001s)]
*  and then they'll do the same thing ten times over. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=763.76s)]
*  They'll raid Swalwell and Garland and Hunter Biden, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=766.26s)]
*  and that'll be just the beginning. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=769.46s)]
*  And will that be good for the country? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=771.46s)]
*  Probably not, but it will be inevitable. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrDHnRijhvM&t=773.16s)]
