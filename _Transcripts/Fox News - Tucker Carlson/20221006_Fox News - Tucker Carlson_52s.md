**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ)
*  So you just came from Paris Fashion Week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You just landed, and your boulangneur is still on from it. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=1.76s)]
*  And there's a photograph on it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=4.4s)]
*  What is that? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=6.0s)]
*  It's a photograph of a baby's ultrasound. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=7.36s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=10.68s)]
*  And you designed that? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=12.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=13.16s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=13.76s)]
*  It just represents life. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm pro-life. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Boy, so you wear it on a badge. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=18.28s)]
*  What kind of response do you get? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=19.68s)]
*  And amen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  I agree. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=22.44s)]
*  I don't care about people's responses. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=23.04s)]
*  I care about the fact that there's more black babies being [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=24.64s)]
*  aborted than born in New York City at this point. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=28.66s)]
*  That 50% of black death in America is abortion. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=31.58s)]
*  So I really don't care about people's responses. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=37.42s)]
*  I perform for an audience of one, and that's God. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd2swxLooQ&t=39.82s)]
