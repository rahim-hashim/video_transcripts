# Tucker Carlson: These are lunatic policies
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Hope you had a great Thanksgiving, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=2.84s)]
*  a day away from politics and mass media [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=5.0s)]
*  with people you love and who love you back. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=7.76s)]
*  It's really a spiritual spot treatment. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=10.68s)]
*  That's the ideal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=12.36s)]
*  We ought to do it more than a couple times a year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  But we are back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  And now that we are an obvious observation, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=16.12s)]
*  all prosperity in this country depends ultimately on energy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=18.84s)]
*  Our consumer economy runs on it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=23.32s)]
*  It takes energy to make things [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=25.2s)]
*  and bring them to your house. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  Our tech economy runs on energy too, a lot of it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=28.76s)]
*  How do you think they keep their server farms running? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=32.440000000000005s)]
*  Energy is pretty much in fact the key to everything [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=34.92s)]
*  that Americans do for a living. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=37.0s)]
*  It's the key to healthcare and agriculture [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=38.2s)]
*  and yes, media and travel and construction, entertainment. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  Even finance, which is symbiotic with the real economy, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=44.56s)]
*  depends in the end on energy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=47.52s)]
*  because you can't lend money to businesses [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=49.8s)]
*  if they no longer exist. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=51.88s)]
*  And if energy prices go up high enough, they don't exist. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=52.96s)]
*  So given how central, very obviously central, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=56.24s)]
*  energy is to everything that matters in America, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=59.2s)]
*  it's hard to believe that the Biden administration [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  would intentionally make energy much more expensive [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=64.08s)]
*  because we know for a fact, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  having seen it repeatedly through history, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=68.84s)]
*  that high energy prices will crush our economy faster [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=70.28s)]
*  even than the COVID lockdowns did. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=73.56s)]
*  People will become poor. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  Some of them will die. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=77.4s)]
*  That's not a guess, it will happen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=79.36s)]
*  So given all that, it's unimaginable that anyone [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=81.48s)]
*  but our enemies would want to raise our energy prices [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=83.96s)]
*  to the point where our economy collapses. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=87.0s)]
*  And yet that is exactly what the Biden administration [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=89.28s)]
*  has decided to do. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=91.52s)]
*  And to do it, they're using twin instruments [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  of climate policy and their war against Russia. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  The effect, in a nation with the largest recoverable [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  oil reserves on planet Earth, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=101.72s)]
*  many Americans can no longer afford fossil fuels. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=103.96s)]
*  And once again, this is not an accident. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=107.56s)]
*  It's not a natural cycle we're going through. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  Politicians and policymakers are doing it to us on purpose. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Now that the midterm elections are over, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=117.64s)]
*  the media can finally begin to cover [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=118.88s)]
*  the inevitable results of these policies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=120.4s)]
*  CNN, for example, just ran an article about Americans [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=123.0s)]
*  who are worried about freezing to death [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=125.44s)]
*  over the winter in America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=127.44s)]
*  One 63 year old woman in Philadelphia [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=129.48s)]
*  called Charmaine Johnson said that she is torn [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=131.2s)]
*  between heating her home and buying food. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=133.44s)]
*  And of course she's choosing food [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=135.88s)]
*  because she has no choice. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=136.96s)]
*  It's miserable, she said, it's like living in an igloo. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=138.24s)]
*  Another man, a 67 year old man called Tim Wisely, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=141.64s)]
*  said he turns on his heat only when [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  his teeth begin to chatter. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  You can't go food shopping and get oil. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=148.76s)]
*  It's one or the other, he said. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=151.24s)]
*  It's a horrible feeling. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=152.84s)]
*  It's a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  And it's a feeling that Americans [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=156.56s)]
*  have not had in generations. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=157.88s)]
*  These are American citizens living in a major [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=159.72s)]
*  American city that used to be considered first world [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=162.32s)]
*  and they can't afford heat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=164.64s)]
*  And it's happening not just in Philadelphia, but everywhere. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=167.24s)]
*  Average home heating prices went up 17% last year [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=170.56s)]
*  and they're up another 18% this year. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=173.76s)]
*  Again, not organic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=175.88s)]
*  This is the result of policies [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  from the Biden administration and its allies. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=180.28s)]
*  Not just in the Congress, but in think tanks [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=183.4s)]
*  across Washington and in the entire American news media. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=185.4s)]
*  This did not happen by accident. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  As Fox Business has reported, once winter arrived, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=191.44s)]
*  the problem is gonna get much worse. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=194.04s)]
*  We're riding around with Oil for Less [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=196.12s)]
*  and they say that their customers are struggling [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=197.88s)]
*  to keep up with these skyrocketing costs. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=201.24s)]
*  Across the board, heating costs are expected [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=202.8s)]
*  to be high this winter. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=204.8s)]
*  Heating oil in particular, up 68% year over year. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Today, they filled up this tank with about $950 [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=210.28s)]
*  worth of home heating oil. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  A year ago, the same amount of oil [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  would have cost them closer to $600. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=217.08s)]
*  That's why the company tells me that some customers [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=220.0s)]
*  are just doing without. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  People have gone without hot water and heat for a week [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  just because they haven't had the money to call me [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  and say, hey, come on in. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=230.08s)]
*  They don't have the money for hot water or heat? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  Again, what country is this? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  Any country that can't provide hot water or heat [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=238.28s)]
*  in the winter isn't much of a country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  And again, it doesn't need to be this way [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  because we have the largest recoverable oil reserves [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  on the planet. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  What happens when energy costs continue to rise [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  when people run out of money and it doesn't take long? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=250.96s)]
*  According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=253.16000000000003s)]
*  households are spending their cash reserves [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=255.24s)]
*  far faster than anyone, all those economists projected, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=257.08000000000004s)]
*  even as credit card debt reaches historic levels. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=260.56s)]
*  If you're borrowing money for household expenses [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=264.72s)]
*  on your credit card at exorbitant rates, you're done. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=267.04s)]
*  As Business Insider reported, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=271.48s)]
*  Americans have already burned through a third [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=272.88s)]
*  of their pent-up savings. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  That's nearly three times more than previously thought [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=276.24s)]
*  and signals spending will soon slow down. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=278.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's what happens when people run out of money. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  They stop spending it because they don't have it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  and then the consumer economy slows. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=285.04s)]
*  So when energy costs rise, again, just to be clear, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=288.52s)]
*  because it's not sophisticated economics here, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=292.04s)]
*  when they rise, so does the price of everything else. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=295.0s)]
*  And the first staple to rise in cost is the one [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=298.12s)]
*  that you have to have and that's food. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=301.12s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=303.32s)]
*  On the menu this year for Thanksgiving, rising prices. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=305.28s)]
*  Overall prices are up 7.7% from last year [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=308.64s)]
*  and grocery prices are more than 12% higher than a year ago. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=311.8s)]
*  Here's what it means for the family grocery bill [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=316.92s)]
*  as you shop for the big day. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=319.36s)]
*  First, the turkey. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=321.12s)]
*  Per pound prices for turkey are up 17% year over year. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  An average frozen turkey costs roughly $2.38 a pound. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=326.64s)]
*  That's up from $1.74. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=331.0s)]
*  Now you can blame the avian flu outbreaks [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  and higher fuel, feed and labor costs [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=335.48s)]
*  because of inflation running near 40 year highs. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  What about eggs? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=341.48s)]
*  Eggs cost 43% more than a year ago. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=342.32s)]
*  Butter and margarine are up 34%. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=345.16s)]
*  Flour is up nearly 25%. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=347.6s)]
*  Your pies are gonna cost more to make. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=350.4s)]
*  These higher prices could potentially [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=352.56s)]
*  change Thanksgiving plans. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=354.2s)]
*  So why is this happening? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=356.04s)]
*  Well, you heard the reporter allude to it [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=357.76s)]
*  but not really explain it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=359.64s)]
*  There are of course many factors, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=360.84s)]
*  but there are two big factors that are driving this, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=362.8s)]
*  driving inflation and the rising cost [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=365.64s)]
*  of everything around you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=367.92s)]
*  And they are in order, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=369.16s)]
*  global warming policy and the war in Ukraine. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=371.44s)]
*  Now, as it always does, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=375.48s)]
*  the left use people's best instincts, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=377.36s)]
*  compassion and care for the planet [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=379.88000000000005s)]
*  to subvert them into supporting these two lunatic policies. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=382.36s)]
*  If you care about people, you support the war in Ukraine. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=386.88s)]
*  If you care about the planet, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=389.72s)]
*  you support global warming policy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=390.88s)]
*  But of course, neither one of these [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  was about what they said it was about. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  Both of them were designed to spike energy costs, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=396.52s)]
*  to increase the control of the people currently in charge [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=400.56s)]
*  and to enrich their donors. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=403.28s)]
*  So if you wanted to fix this, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  the very first thing you would do [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  if you wanted to help the American middle class [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=408.52s)]
*  would be to force a ceasefire in Ukraine. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=410.08s)]
*  That would help the world [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=413.84s)]
*  and it would help our middle class. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=414.76s)]
*  Then you would encourage more domestic energy production [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=416.2s)]
*  because we have the domestic energy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  Then you would take a look at the trillions [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=422.44s)]
*  we have spent on renewable energy, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=425.12s)]
*  solar panels, electric cars, wind power. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=427.88s)]
*  This has made a small group of people incredibly rich, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=432.56s)]
*  but it has put our grid in peril [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=435.36s)]
*  and it has raised the cost of energy [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=437.56s)]
*  beyond the reach of middle-class Americans. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=439.16s)]
*  But the Biden administration is not looking for solutions, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  just the opposite. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=444.16s)]
*  They're looking for ways to squeeze a few more dollars [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=445.4s)]
*  out of an increasingly impoverished American middle class. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=448.32s)]
*  According to Bloomberg this week, and we're quoting, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=451.08s)]
*  the IRS says more auditors and upgraded technology [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=453.52s)]
*  could help raise as much as $1 trillion. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=456.68s)]
*  Oh, so you have less money and they plan to take more. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  If that's not an act of hostility, what is? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=465.12s)]
*  It is an act of hostility. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=468.2s)]
*  They don't like you and they're not hiding it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=469.68s)]
*  But big picture, every other major company in America [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=472.32s)]
*  is laying people off, but the IRS somehow, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=475.4s)]
*  thanks to Joe Manchin, the moderate from West Virginia, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  the IRS somehow has the dough to hire 87,000 new employees [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=481.44s)]
*  and they're coming for you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=486.32s)]
*  They didn't hire those people by accident, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=487.64s)]
*  they hired them to take more of your money. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=489.16s)]
*  So businesses who have to forecast for a living [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=491.8s)]
*  have seen this coming and they're preparing to cut workers. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=493.96s)]
*  And so what this looks like, if you take three steps back, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=497.36s)]
*  is an economic death spiral. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=499.56s)]
*  Ahead of Christmas shopping season, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=501.8s)]
*  when Amazon usually adds employees, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=503.44s)]
*  Amazon is now laying off employees, a lot of them. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=505.4s)]
*  10,000 people laid off from Amazon. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=507.92s)]
*  And the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=510.16s)]
*  is actually encouraging people, his customers, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=512.1600000000001s)]
*  not to buy his products. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=514.96s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=516.52s)]
*  The economy does not look great right now. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=517.84s)]
*  Things are slowing down. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=520.08s)]
*  You're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=521.0s)]
*  People are slowing down. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=524.48s)]
*  The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=527.6s)]
*  we're likely to be in one very soon. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=530.52s)]
*  If you're an individual and you're thinking about [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=532.72s)]
*  buying a new large screen TV, maybe slow that down. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=534.4s)]
*  Keep that cash, see what happens. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=537.64s)]
*  Same thing with a refrigerator or a new car or whatever. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=539.8s)]
*  Let's take some risk off the table. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=542.84s)]
*  If you're a small business, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=544.24s)]
*  maybe delay some capital purchases. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  Do you really need that new piece of equipment? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=547.76s)]
*  Maybe it can weigh a little bit. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=549.36s)]
*  Have some cash on hand. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=550.88s)]
*  Just a little bit of risk reduction [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=552.08s)]
*  could make the difference for that small business [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=554.08s)]
*  if we do get into even more serious economic problems. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=556.6s)]
*  So you gotta play the probabilities a little bit. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=558.8s)]
*  Wait, so the guy who sells big screen TVs on the internet [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=561.08s)]
*  is telling his customers, the source of his personal wealth, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=564.8s)]
*  not to buy big screen TVs off the internet? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=567.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  That's how worried he is. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  That he actually, maybe the first time ever [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  is caring about you. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=574.2s)]
*  Well, that's quite amazing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=575.36s)]
*  And he's not the only one, Bezos is not the only one [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=576.6s)]
*  who's worried that something bad is about to happen [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  to our economy, the global economy. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  In October, the IMF warned that 2023 [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  will bring a recession for most of the world. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=585.0s)]
*  That same month, the CEO of JP Morgan, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=587.28s)]
*  the country's biggest bank, Jamie Dimon, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=589.32s)]
*  said a recession is almost certain in the coming months. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=591.24s)]
*  So what do you do to avert a disaster? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=595.32s)]
*  Well, you probably can't stop it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=597.2s)]
*  You should know what its outlines will look at. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=599.4000000000001s)]
*  Take a look at the housing market if you wanna know. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=601.2s)]
*  Home sales are at their lowest level in a decade. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=603.24s)]
*  As the Fed raises interest rates to fight inflation, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=605.84s)]
*  mortgages become too expensive. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=608.6s)]
*  But if the Fed were to cut interest rates, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=611.32s)]
*  home prices would go up along with inflation. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  You see the problem here. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  We've reached the end of monetary policy's ability [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=617.88s)]
*  to tweak our economy. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=621.96s)]
*  So faced with all of this, the one thing you'd hope [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=624.6s)]
*  is to have an administration that understands [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=627.4s)]
*  what the problem is and might at least be interested [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=629.16s)]
*  in fixing it and taking care of the middle class, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=632.28s)]
*  people who don't have a margin, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  people who aren't on the bottom. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=636.64s)]
*  They're always the subject of our concern. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=638.0s)]
*  What do you do about the homeless? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=639.28s)]
*  What do you do if people make $80,000 [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=641.12s)]
*  in the New York suburbs? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  Nobody cares about them. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=644.6s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden explaining to the straight face [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=646.6s)]
*  that actually everything's fine. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=648.0400000000001s)]
*  His economic plan is working. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=649.24s)]
*  Folks, my economic plan is showing results. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=651.44s)]
*  People are starting to feel it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=653.76s)]
*  We're making progress on bringing down inflation [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=655.76s)]
*  without losing jobs. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=658.68s)]
*  Folks are seeing much needed break in inflation [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=660.12s)]
*  at the grocery store as we head into holidays. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=662.6s)]
*  So that's pathetic and everyone knows it's pathetic [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=666.08s)]
*  and maybe the only upside of the Biden administration [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=668.08s)]
*  is that there's really no lying at this point. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=670.04s)]
*  This isn't working. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=672.28s)]
*  They just did better than expected in the midterms [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=674.2s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, unfortunately. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=676.08s)]
*  But we're now facing the next election in 2024 [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=677.92s)]
*  and no sane person wants Joe Biden to run [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=680.4s)]
*  because everybody gets that this is unsustainable. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=683.6s)]
*  Even the media gets that at this point. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=685.8s)]
*  So the question is who replaces Joe Biden [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=687.9599999999999s)]
*  and what can that person do about the disaster [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=689.92s)]
*  that his administration has created? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUfuzz2n9Y&t=692.24s)]
