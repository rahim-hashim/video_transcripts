# Russia expert: Are US sanctions causing unintended consequences in Russia?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE)
*  So everyone loves sanctions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=0.0s)]
*  They seem like a relatively painless way [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=1.72s)]
*  to punish people who deserve to be punished. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=3.56s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, for example, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=5.24s)]
*  a lot of people were very upset [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  about the invasion of Ukraine, understandably. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=7.92s)]
*  So why not sanction Putin? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=10.72s)]
*  But there are two questions that you should have to answer [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=12.34s)]
*  before you move forward with a policy like that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=14.6s)]
*  The first is, do the sanctions punish the people [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=16.8s)]
*  they're intended to punish? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=19.36s)]
*  And the second is, are there unintended consequences [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=21.0s)]
*  that we should be thinking about? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=23.16s)]
*  Good intentions are not enough. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=24.16s)]
*  You have to care about the effects of your policies. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=25.28s)]
*  That's how adults make decisions. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=27.72s)]
*  Are these adult decisions that are helping us [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=30.68s)]
*  and hurting Putin? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  Clint Ehrlich is a Russian policy analyst. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=33.36s)]
*  He joins us tonight to assess those questions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=36.64s)]
*  Clint, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=39.12s)]
*  So to the first, are these sanctions hurting [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=40.44s)]
*  Vladimir Putin? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=43.16s)]
*  That's the point, are they working? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=44.0s)]
*  No, the sanctions are helping Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=46.08s)]
*  His approval rating has actually gone up in Russia, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=48.36s)]
*  10 points from 61% to 71% now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=50.36s)]
*  And so even though the sanctions may be hurting Russia, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=54.32s)]
*  they're consolidating Putin's power within the country [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  and making him a more robust enemy of the United States. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=60.279999999999994s)]
*  Well, but wait, that's kind of the last thing [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=64.08s)]
*  we wanna do, isn't it? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=66.2s)]
*  And by the way, I just wanna assume [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  for the purpose of this conversation, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=69.28s)]
*  good intentions on the part of people who back sanctions, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=70.44s)]
*  I think most people who are for sanctions [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=72.6s)]
*  think that they work. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=74.14s)]
*  But you're saying they're having the opposite effect. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=75.6s)]
*  I know individuals on the ground in Russia [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=79.16s)]
*  who were frankly anti-Putin and pro-Western [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=81.64s)]
*  before this happened. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  And they've been impacted by these sanctions so much [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=85.68s)]
*  that they're now really turning against the West. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=88.4s)]
*  Your viewers may not realize this, Tucker, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=90.64s)]
*  but international calls into Russia are being blocked today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=92.32s)]
*  When Russians try to call home, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=95.44s)]
*  they get a message telling them to go expletive themselves. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=97.04s)]
*  And so these are cruel measures [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=100.12s)]
*  that are making the Russians turn against us [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  in a really significant way. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=104.52s)]
*  They're angry, they're angry at us [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=107.0s)]
*  about the way that they're being treated. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=109.16s)]
*  Russians who don't support the invasion of Ukraine, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=111.28s)]
*  who don't support Putin, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=113.72s)]
*  I think it's an interesting point. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=114.72s)]
*  Are there counterproductive effects, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=116.12s)]
*  effects of sanctions that might hurt the United States? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  I think that's probably something we should think about. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=121.32s)]
*  Are there any that come to mind? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=123.58s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=125.4s)]
*  What we've effectively done [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=126.24s)]
*  is started to re-erect the Iron Curtain. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=127.24s)]
*  It was our policy during the Cold War [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=129.92s)]
*  to try to integrate Russia with the West, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=131.96s)]
*  to try to integrate them politically and economically. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=134.9s)]
*  And instead what we've done is isolate them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=137.92s)]
*  And so essentially we've created a new North Korea, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  but this time with 6,000 nuclear weapons [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=142.32s)]
*  and so that doesn't advance our national interests [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=145.4s)]
*  and frankly it threatens global security. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=146.6s)]
*  So if you're kicking Russia [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=149.12s)]
*  out of the global financial system, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=150.88s)]
*  so that's an idea that has actually been affected. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=153.36s)]
*  We've done that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=156.26s)]
*  But you gotta wonder if that might boomerang [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=158.12s)]
*  and make the United States less influential over time [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=160.44s)]
*  in the global financial system. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=164.16s)]
*  Is that a possibility? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=165.36s)]
*  It's already happening. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=166.82s)]
*  Today any state has to consider the risk [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=168.04s)]
*  that if it holds dollars as a reserve currency [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=170.74s)]
*  for its central bank, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=173.52s)]
*  that those assets or other fiat assets [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  that are under the control of the West could be frozen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  And so Russia and China have an incentive [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=180.4s)]
*  to create essentially a parallel economy [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=182.28s)]
*  separate from ours so that they won't be under our control. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=185.24s)]
*  It frankly undermines our influence very directly. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  Last question, Econ 101. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  Everyone who looks at the United States [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=193.72s)]
*  realizes that if the rest of the world [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  were to stop buying US debt, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=196.84s)]
*  the United States would grind to a halt [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=198.72s)]
*  and no longer be a rich country. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=200.8s)]
*  Instantaneously. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=202.36s)]
*  Does any of our reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=203.84s)]
*  make it more likely that other countries [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=207.74s)]
*  will stop buying US debt? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=212.36s)]
*  I mean, there's a real threat [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  that they could stop buying our debt. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=216.0s)]
*  And so we're undermining really [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=219.36s)]
*  our most valuable asset that way. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=221.0s)]
*  You know, we're living on borrowed time economically [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=224.12s)]
*  and we're getting into an economic war [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  that we may not leave unscathed. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=229.56s)]
*  I think every American, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=232.56s)]
*  most are horrified by this invasion, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=233.96s)]
*  should ask their lawmakers, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  is anything you're doing making it less likely [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=236.56s)]
*  the rest of the world will buy our debt, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=239.4s)]
*  we'll start unloading our debt. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=240.88000000000002s)]
*  And what would be the consequences of that Dumbo? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=242.24s)]
*  Clint Ehrlich, I appreciate thinking like an adult. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=245.52s)]
*  We don't hear it very often. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  You do, clearly, so thank you for that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=250.02s)]
*  My pleasure. Thank you, Tucker. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJMc0hhTrE&t=252.46s)]
