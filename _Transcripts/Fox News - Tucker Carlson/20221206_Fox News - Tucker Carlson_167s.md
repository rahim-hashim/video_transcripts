# Stephen Miller: This is the most 'insidious' form of amnesty
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA)
*  Stephen Miller is a senior advisor, was for four years, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=0.0s)]
*  to President Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=4.24s)]
*  He implemented many of the policies [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=5.08s)]
*  that the Biden people canceled. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=6.48s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Stephen Miller, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=8.4s)]
*  So it's a little, when you look at pictures [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=10.16s)]
*  of what's actually happening at the border, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  when you see the numbers of 5 million people in two years, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=15.0s)]
*  totally changing the American population, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  how could Tom Tillis and Murkowski and Romney, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=19.66s)]
*  how could they support giving an amnesty in the face of that? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=23.8s)]
*  Because they support unlimited immigration [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=30.28s)]
*  into this country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=33.08s)]
*  They believe fundamentally as a philosophic matter [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=34.1s)]
*  that Americans aren't up to it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=36.84s)]
*  Americans can't cut it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=38.08s)]
*  The American middle class is no good. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=39.2s)]
*  Its values are useless. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=41.0s)]
*  Its history is useless. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=42.28s)]
*  Its aspirations mean nothing to them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=43.3s)]
*  Like the dirt that you walk on the ground. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=45.34s)]
*  So of course you need to bring in new people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=47.3s)]
*  And I would say that on the Dreamer point specifically, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  it is the most insidious form of amnesty [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=52.56s)]
*  that any country could ever consider. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=55.92s)]
*  Because the message to the world is, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=58.76s)]
*  smuggle a child into this country [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=61.0s)]
*  and that child will be rewarded with US citizenship. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=63.28s)]
*  And what you will have, and what we're already seeing, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=66.08s)]
*  is a wave of illegal minors being brought into this country [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=68.84s)]
*  of biblical proportions. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=72.88s)]
*  I just to put this into numerical perspective, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=74.92s)]
*  in 2020, when we use Title 42 [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=77.46s)]
*  to adopt a 100% repatriation policy for minors, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=80.82s)]
*  we achieved the lowest levels of minor crossings [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=86.77999999999999s)]
*  since pre-Obama amnesty times. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=90.05999999999999s)]
*  You talked about DACA in your opening. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=93.05999999999999s)]
*  So before that, no one had ever seen numbers [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=95.02s)]
*  that were that low of minors. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=97.61999999999999s)]
*  Before this whole thing started, then Biden came in. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=99.1s)]
*  And despite warnings from Border Patrol, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=102.5s)]
*  he said that minors are exempt from Title 42, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=104.74s)]
*  the automatic expulsion policy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=108.85999999999999s)]
*  We have now seen almost every single month under Biden, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  let this sink in, almost every single month under Biden, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=114.58s)]
*  the number of unaccompanied minors [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=119.06s)]
*  who have entered the country [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=121.36s)]
*  is higher than every single month [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=123.06s)]
*  in American history before Biden. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=125.82s)]
*  Every month, almost without exception, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=128.3s)]
*  is higher than any month in all of history before Biden. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=130.74s)]
*  And in that environment, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=134.28s)]
*  Sinema and Tillis and others are saying, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=136.1s)]
*  let us codify the idea that smuggled minors [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=139.22s)]
*  are Americans for life. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=142.62s)]
*  It's insane, Tucker. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's encouraging human trafficking. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=146.78s)]
*  Tom Tillis, that's what you're doing, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  and you know that's what you're doing, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=151.18s)]
*  but you're doing it anyway. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=152.56s)]
*  Stephen Miller, appreciate you coming on. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=153.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--CseFdfXA&t=155.5s)]
