# Tucker Carlson: Asking obvious questions is forbidden
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, there are a few things more infuriating [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=2.0s)]
*  than being lied to by your own government, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=5.0s)]
*  the government you pay for, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=7.48s)]
*  the one your ancestors risked their lives to protect. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  Does that happen to you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=11.64s)]
*  Of course it has, it enrages you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=12.48s)]
*  But if it happens again and again, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=15.06s)]
*  if it happens often enough, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=16.34s)]
*  if your government makes a habit of lying to you, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=17.42s)]
*  then over time it becomes something else. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=21.02s)]
*  Over time you realize [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=22.52s)]
*  you're not really living in a democracy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=24.1s)]
*  You can't be. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  Because in a democracy, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=27.84s)]
*  the government has a moral and legal obligation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=29.0s)]
*  to tell you the truth always, period. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=31.8s)]
*  And that makes sense because in a democracy, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=35.88s)]
*  you are not a subject or a mere consumer, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=37.78s)]
*  you're a citizen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=40.54s)]
*  You are a shareholder in the system. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=41.8s)]
*  You are an owner of it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=43.68s)]
*  The people who run your government are your employees. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  They're like your cleaning lady. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  You may appreciate the work they do, good job. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=50.44s)]
*  But the minute you catch them stealing your cufflinks, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=53.08s)]
*  you fired them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=55.32s)]
*  Those are the rules because it's your house, not theirs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=57.04s)]
*  But what if the rules were inverted? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=61.56s)]
*  What if you caught an employee stealing, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=63.6s)]
*  but instead of seeming ashamed and penitent, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=66.5s)]
*  he whipped around and attacked you, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=69.0s)]
*  like you were the criminal? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=71.54s)]
*  Well, that is the experience [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=73.76s)]
*  of watching White House spokesman John Kirby [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=74.78s)]
*  talk about the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=76.88s)]
*  Anyone who imagines, who thinks for a moment [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=79.9s)]
*  the Biden administration was in any way involved [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=82.2s)]
*  with that sabotage, directly or indirectly, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=84.52s)]
*  is not simply wrong. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=87.24s)]
*  No, anyone who imagines that is a bad person, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=88.6s)]
*  a tool of Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=92.72s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Did the US or a proxy for the US have anything to do [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  with the explosion on the Nord Stream pipeline? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=100.56s)]
*  The United States had nothing to do with it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=104.0s)]
*  That's just Russian propaganda and disinformation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=105.58s)]
*  Now we know it was an act of sabotage, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=108.14s)]
*  but there's an investigation going on right now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=110.14s)]
*  I don't think we're gonna get into credentialing that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=112.08s)]
*  in terms of who was responsible. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=116.72s)]
*  We're gonna let the investigators take a look at that, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=119.48s)]
*  but clearly this was an act of sabotage. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=121.28s)]
*  So you can officially say that the US [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=123.0s)]
*  was not involved in any way in this attack? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=125.0s)]
*  That's right, that's correct. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=129.2s)]
*  Not to belabor this, but for the people who look at this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=130.56s)]
*  and say, why would Russia attack its own pipeline [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=133.1s)]
*  that creates leverage over Europe and perhaps the West, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=136.66s)]
*  what do you say to them? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=140.8s)]
*  Again, I can't speak to specific accountability [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=142.68s)]
*  for this act of sabotage. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=144.84s)]
*  I can just assure you the United States [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=147.4s)]
*  had nothing to do with it, of course. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  That's just Russian propaganda. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  So notice Brett Baer asked the question, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=154.0s)]
*  did the US, did the Biden administration [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  or any of its proxies have anything to do with the sabotage? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  To which John Kirby says, we didn't do it, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=163.94s)]
*  and then moves right to the point, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  which is anyone who says we did it [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  is repeating Russian propaganda. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=168.44s)]
*  That's what John Kirby said. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=171.64s)]
*  It's disinformation from Quisling, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=173.4s)]
*  it's more loyal to Vladimir Putin than their own country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=175.16s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that only truly bad people say. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=178.32s)]
*  Okay, if the White House says so, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=181.68s)]
*  obviously we have no choice but to believe it, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=183.6s)]
*  but you still have to wonder, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=185.24s)]
*  not everyone does believe that, why? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=186.98s)]
*  Where might some Americans have gotten the notion [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=190.8s)]
*  that the Biden administration might have been involved [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=193.48s)]
*  directly or through a proxy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=195.96s)]
*  in the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=197.6s)]
*  Why would they think that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=200.42s)]
*  They certainly didn't watch it on Russia today. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=201.28s)]
*  RT has been pulled off the air. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=203.72s)]
*  They didn't hear it from Putin or any of his ministers. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=206.28s)]
*  You can barely find anything [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=209.72s)]
*  from the Russian government on Google. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=211.12s)]
*  And of course, any book sympathetic to Putin [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=213.2s)]
*  has been banned on Amazon. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=215.64s)]
*  In fact, every piece of information [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  that reflects the modern Russian point of view [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  has been censored in the United States [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  because this is a free country fighting for democracy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=223.26s)]
*  You just can't read what you want or think what you want. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=225.54s)]
*  So actually, if you think about it, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=228.9s)]
*  if Americans are deluded about [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=230.76s)]
*  what happened to the Nord Stream pipeline, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=232.94s)]
*  the delusion didn't come from Moscow [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  because there's no way for Moscow [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=236.14s)]
*  to get us disinformation to the United States [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=237.78s)]
*  because the US government has blocked it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  along with the tech companies. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=241.84s)]
*  So where did that idea come from? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=243.34s)]
*  Why might they think that? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=244.66s)]
*  Well, maybe they learned it from Joe Biden himself. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  He's the president. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=248.72s)]
*  Here's Biden this winter on American television [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=250.42s)]
*  pledging to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=253.86s)]
*  if Russia does something he doesn't want them to do. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=257.74s)]
*  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=258.98s)]
*  crossing the border of Ukraine again. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=262.86s)]
*  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=268.18s)]
*  We will bring an end to it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=273.98s)]
*  How will you do that exactly [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=278.22s)]
*  since the project and control of the project [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  is within Germany's control? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=285.58000000000004s)]
*  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=288.3s)]
*  So that's about as clear as it gets. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=292.7s)]
*  Biden doesn't say we will shut it down. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=294.98s)]
*  He will say there will be no Nord Stream pipeline. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=297.42s)]
*  We will put an end to it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=299.94s)]
*  And then the reporter says, but wait a second, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=301.06s)]
*  it's not your pipeline. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=302.70000000000005s)]
*  How will you be able to do that? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  So he has a chance to reframe the question, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=306.98s)]
*  to revise his answer, to be more precise, but he doesn't. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=309.70000000000005s)]
*  He says, I promise you, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=312.86s)]
*  we'll be able to take out Nord Stream. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden, President of the United States. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=317.06s)]
*  So there's that clue. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  And that is, as if that wasn't enough, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=320.82s)]
*  last week, last Friday, the Secretary of State [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=323.42s)]
*  in the Biden administration, Mr. Tony Blinken, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=325.54s)]
*  bragged about how great the sabotage of Nord Stream was. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=327.7s)]
*  And we're quoting. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=331.18s)]
*  It's a tremendous opportunity, said Tony Blinken. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=332.1s)]
*  It's a great thing, not a tragedy, a victory, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=336.02000000000004s)]
*  something we're in favor of. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=340.42s)]
*  We're excited about it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=342.46s)]
*  Destroyed a natural gas pipeline. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  We're for that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  So that might be another clue [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  that the Biden administration [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  may have had something to do with it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=351.58s)]
*  Oh, but no, says the White House. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=352.94s)]
*  Despite the fact that we promised we would do it, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  and then we quote about how great it was after it happened, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=358.34s)]
*  we had nothing at all to do with it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  Who did it? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=364.74s)]
*  Well, Russia did it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=365.56s)]
*  They blew up their own pipeline, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=367.26s)]
*  making their own country poorer and weaker [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=369.14s)]
*  in the middle of a major war, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=371.94s)]
*  because that's how crazy, but also diabolically effective, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=373.82s)]
*  the Russians are. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=376.78s)]
*  Suicidal yet brilliant. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=377.97999999999996s)]
*  And if you don't buy that story uncritically, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=381.34s)]
*  if you have any questions about how exactly that might work, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=383.38s)]
*  you're a disloyal American. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=388.41999999999996s)]
*  Here's Chris Stewart, a Republican member [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=390.58s)]
*  of Congress from Utah, making the very same point. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=392.02s)]
*  John Kirby with the National Security Council [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=394.78s)]
*  was on earlier, in no uncertain terms, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=396.46s)]
*  said the US was not behind, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=398.62s)]
*  and a proxy of the US was not behind [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=400.1s)]
*  the explosion on the Nord Stream pipeline. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=402.26000000000005s)]
*  From your perspective, both of you, you agree with that? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=404.54s)]
*  Oh, absolutely, this is the last thing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=408.82000000000005s)]
*  that we want to raise gas prices further in Europe. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  It's pretty obvious this is a Russian sabotage operation. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  And for the people, Congressman Stewart, that say, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=416.54s)]
*  why would Russia do that on its own pipeline, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=418.74s)]
*  what do you say? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, then people who are suggesting the US, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=422.98s)]
*  that is exactly what Vladimir Putin wants. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=426.06s)]
*  It's just so great. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=429.18s)]
*  I mean, it's perfectly bipartisan. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=430.94s)]
*  Here you have a Republican from Utah, Chris Stewart, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=433.18s)]
*  and a Democrat from Massachusetts, Seth Moulton, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=436.7s)]
*  agreeing precisely. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=439.46000000000004s)]
*  It's exactly what Vladimir Putin wants. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=443.26s)]
*  He wants you to blame the Biden administration [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=446.5s)]
*  for something he did. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=449.22s)]
*  That's the bipartisan view in Washington. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=450.46000000000004s)]
*  What's interesting is, they don't really know that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=453.26s)]
*  They have no evidence that that's true. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  Briefers from the Intel agencies have, as of this afternoon, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=459.26s)]
*  told members of Congress they have no idea [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=463.29999999999995s)]
*  who committed industrial terrorism against these pipelines. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=465.78s)]
*  Now that itself is a lie, of course. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=469.17999999999995s)]
*  The CIA has no idea at all. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=470.82s)]
*  Right, they have no idea. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=473.09999999999997s)]
*  But as far as members of Congress, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=475.58s)]
*  Chris Stewart and Seth Moulton know, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=477.14s)]
*  there is no evidence either way. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=478.94s)]
*  They have no facts. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=481.17999999999995s)]
*  That is a fact, they have no facts. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=482.97999999999996s)]
*  So again, as a factual matter, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=485.82s)]
*  neither of those guys nor any member of Congress, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=488.14s)]
*  no matter what committee they sit on, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=490.86s)]
*  has any idea who did this. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=492.02s)]
*  But if you suggest the obvious, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=494.46s)]
*  Russia probably didn't do it because why would they do it? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=496.46s)]
*  It's against their own interests, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=499.1s)]
*  no matter what dumb story you're trying to sell us. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=500.38s)]
*  If you suggest that, if you apply common sense, you're evil. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=503.26s)]
*  And then they go farther and say things [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=506.98s)]
*  that are like completely implausible. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=508.78s)]
*  Seth Moulton, we're quoting, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=510.34s)]
*  The last thing we want is to raise gas prices in Europe. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=511.5s)]
*  Really, Seth Moulton, is that true? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=515.06s)]
*  Because isn't the Biden administration [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=518.54s)]
*  philosophically opposed to low gas prices? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=520.02s)]
*  Aren't they opposed to all fossil fuels? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=523.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh right, they are. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=526.5799999999999s)]
*  How do we know that? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=527.66s)]
*  Is that Russian propaganda? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=528.54s)]
*  No, because we can't read Russian propaganda [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=530.1s)]
*  because it's been banned in favor of our propaganda. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=531.74s)]
*  We know that because Joe Biden himself [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=534.1s)]
*  has said so many times on television. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=536.5799999999999s)]
*  Okay, so maybe there is a motive here. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=539.5s)]
*  Maybe there's more than one motive. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=541.86s)]
*  But don't ask. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=544.58s)]
*  Because, warn the media, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=546.5400000000001s)]
*  asking obvious questions is forbidden. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=548.7800000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=552.02s)]
*  Fox News host Tucker Carlson, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  irresponsibly claiming the United States [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=554.98s)]
*  was responsible for the leak. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=557.7800000000001s)]
*  Other than Putin and Tucker Carlson, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=559.38s)]
*  it seems pretty clear that everyone knows [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=561.1s)]
*  that Putin did this himself. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=562.5400000000001s)]
*  And Tucker Carlson, this past week, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=563.9000000000001s)]
*  actually once again directly repeated Russian propaganda, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=568.22s)]
*  suggesting it was somehow the United States [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=572.82s)]
*  behind the attack on the Nord Stream pipeline. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=574.66s)]
*  How real is that movement? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=577.66s)]
*  Is it growing? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=578.94s)]
*  It's Russian propaganda, how dare they? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=581.74s)]
*  Really, is it really? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=585.5s)]
*  Probably, just thought experiment here, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=588.46s)]
*  a lot of Americans who don't feel any allegiance [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=590.9s)]
*  whatsoever to Russia don't like Putin. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=593.26s)]
*  Why would you, if you're an American? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=596.22s)]
*  But care a lot about their own country [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=598.6999999999999s)]
*  and the behavior of their own government. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=600.74s)]
*  So if their own government, again, the one they pay for, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=602.98s)]
*  the one they supposedly control, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=605.46s)]
*  is doing things contrary to their interests [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=607.6999999999999s)]
*  and then lying about it, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=610.58s)]
*  maybe they think they have a right to know [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=611.9399999999999s)]
*  and ask obvious questions like, are you lying? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=613.38s)]
*  And if you're not lying, speak slowly [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=616.54s)]
*  and tell us how your story, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=618.8199999999999s)]
*  the one you're expecting us to believe makes sense. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=619.9399999999999s)]
*  It's possible that asking questions [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=624.18s)]
*  is a patriotic duty of Americans. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=626.9s)]
*  Shut up, that helps Putin, you're not allowed to say it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=630.0999999999999s)]

*  You're required to believe that Putin [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=644.2199999999999s)]
*  took out his own infrastructure, you must. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=646.26s)]
*  How does this fit into Putin's playbook? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=649.9799999999999s)]
*  Of course, as you would expect, Susan, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=652.46s)]
*  Russia says, oh, we had nothing to do with this, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=654.22s)]
*  we're gonna launch an investigation, but come on. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=655.74s)]
*  Look, the indications are that foul play was involved [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=660.58s)]
*  and that it appears that Russia [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=665.22s)]
*  is certainly the likeliest suspect of this. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=666.82s)]
*  I think this is clearly an act of sabotage of some sort [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=669.74s)]
*  and Russia is certainly the most likely suspect. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=674.26s)]
*  I think this might be just the first salvo [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=678.02s)]
*  of some additional things that might be coming toward Europe. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=680.5s)]
*  What Putin is saying to us by blowing up his pipeline is, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=684.42s)]
*  look, I can blow up a pipeline if need be, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=687.94s)]
*  I can blow up the internet cables coming into your country, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=691.54s)]
*  I can blow up functioning pipelines, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=693.98s)]
*  I could do all sorts of stuff. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=695.86s)]
*  Oh, it's Bill Browder, he's an expert on the subject. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=698.38s)]
*  Believe Bill Browder, don't believe your own lion eyes. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=701.38s)]
*  There was a moment after it was very clear [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=704.58s)]
*  that the war in Iraq was not helping the United States [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=707.46s)]
*  in any way and in fact hurting the core interests [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=709.86s)]
*  of the United States, that the media engaged [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=712.82s)]
*  in a rare nanosecond of self-reflection. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=715.22s)]
*  How do we get here? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=719.22s)]
*  What role did we, for example, the New York Times play [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=720.46s)]
*  in convincing the public that Saddam had WMD when he didn't? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=723.14s)]
*  And for that one moment, you thought, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=727.3000000000001s)]
*  wow, maybe they're learning something, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=728.9s)]
*  maybe they won't do it again. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=731.26s)]
*  But it turns out the opposite happened. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=733.42s)]
*  Now they're just completely doubling down [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=734.98s)]
*  on what's very obviously a lie [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=736.62s)]
*  and attacking anyone who asked to hear it explained rationally. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=738.66s)]
*  And it's not just the media, by the way. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=743.66s)]
*  DC think tanks, whose purpose is long in doubt. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=745.8199999999999s)]
*  Like what's the point of a DC think tank? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=749.3s)]
*  Oh, to run interference for the ruling class, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=750.86s)]
*  to bolster the regime, to be the Praetorian Guard. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=753.74s)]
*  The Brookings Institution filled that role for many years. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=757.02s)]
*  They just produced this analysis, quote, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=760.38s)]
*  U.S. podcasters spread Kremlin narratives [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=762.4599999999999s)]
*  on Nord Stream sabotage. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=765.26s)]
*  What's interesting about this analysis is that nowhere [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=768.38s)]
*  in it does the August Brookings Institution rebut the evidence [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=771.82s)]
*  that the U.S. or a proxy of the Biden administration [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=777.34s)]
*  had something to do with this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=779.62s)]
*  There's in fact, no evidence either way. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=780.9s)]
*  Instead, they just attack anybody who asks questions. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=783.6600000000001s)]
*  Quote, the theories pushed by these podcast hosts [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  align with Kremlin messaging. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=790.98s)]
*  Oh, align with Kremlin messaging. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=793.94s)]
*  They used to be called guilt by association. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=795.78s)]
*  Vladimir Putin likes dogs. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=798.38s)]
*  What, you like dogs? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=799.5799999999999s)]
*  What are you a Russian sympathizer? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  It aligns with Russian propaganda. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=804.66s)]
*  So the point is it doesn't matter whether or not it's true. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=810.74s)]
*  It aligns with Kremlin messaging. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=813.5799999999999s)]
*  Therefore, you must be censored. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=815.6999999999999s)]
*  But not everybody got the memo. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=818.9s)]
*  There are tucked away in the deep recesses [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=820.14s)]
*  of American society, a few honest liberals still left. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=823.6999999999999s)]
*  Maybe they've been, I don't know, in St. Barts [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=826.62s)]
*  for the last three years and didn't realize [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=828.9s)]
*  that you can no longer exercise free speech in this country. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=830.8199999999999s)]
*  One of them is a professor at Columbia called Jeffrey Sachs. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=833.5799999999999s)]
*  So he went on Bloomberg the other day [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=836.54s)]
*  and was asked about the Nord Stream pipelines [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=838.06s)]
*  and he decided to respond rationally. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=839.86s)]
*  And he said, well, actually there's quite a bit of evidence [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=842.14s)]
*  that the Biden administration was involved. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=844.26s)]
*  But rather than follow up, the anchor realizing [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=846.98s)]
*  that forbidden topics were being broached, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=849.5s)]
*  he swore not to talk about this, just shut down the segment. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=851.3399999999999s)]
*  But not before Jeffrey Sachs said this. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=854.6999999999999s)]
*  The destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=857.8199999999999s)]
*  which I would bet was a US action, perhaps US and Poland. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=860.66s)]
*  This is speculation. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=867.42s)]
*  Jeff, Jeff, we gotta stop there. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=868.26s)]
*  That's quite a statement as well. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=869.62s)]
*  Why do you feel that that was a US action? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  What evidence do you have of that? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=875.2199999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, there's direct radar evidence [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=878.14s)]
*  that US military helicopters that are normally based [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=880.26s)]
*  in Gdansk were circling over this area. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=884.3s)]
*  We also had the threats from the United States earlier [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=888.5s)]
*  in this year that one way or another, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=891.34s)]
*  we are going to end Nord Stream. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=893.1s)]
*  You're not allowed to say these things in the West, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=895.98s)]
*  but the fact of the matter is all over the world, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=899.74s)]
*  when I talk to people, they think the US did it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=902.54s)]
*  And just to tell you, and by the way, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=906.38s)]
*  even reporters on our papers that are involved [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=908.62s)]
*  tell me privately, well, of course, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=913.22s)]
*  but it doesn't show up in our media. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=916.14s)]
*  The anchor's clearly getting instructions from the Chrome. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=923.14s)]
*  Stop him, stop him. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=924.94s)]
*  What evidence do you have? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=926.1s)]
*  Well, there's a radar evidence. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=927.6600000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=929.0600000000001s)]
*  Be quiet. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=929.9s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=933.0600000000001s)]
*  Just cut him off. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=934.8199999999999s)]
*  Never invite him back. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=936.5s)]
*  Stop. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=937.86s)]
*  The only explanation allowed, of course, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=939.78s)]
*  is the one the government wants you to believe. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=941.86s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is so evil, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=944.74s)]
*  he's destroying his own pipelines. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Abayg3k_o&t=946.54s)]
