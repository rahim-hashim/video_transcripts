# JD Vance tells Tucker: It's time for Republicans to get victories
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo)
*  He's now a senator from Ohio, hasn't been on TV since his election, and we're happy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=0.0s)]
*  to have him join us right now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=6.24s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  So you've been in Washington, what, just a couple of, well, days, really? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=10.64s)]
*  What's, I just have to ask, what's your perception? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=15.76s)]
*  What's your first reaction? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=18.28s)]
*  Well, I guess my first reaction, Tucker, is they don't work very hard because we got sworn [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=20.44s)]
*  in on Tuesday, and then we started a three-week recess. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=26.68s)]
*  So I'm actually back in my home in Cincinnati right now, which is so crazy to me because [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=30.0s)]
*  it's not like the country doesn't have major crises and problems that you would expect [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=34.32s)]
*  its United States Senate to actually be working on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=38.56s)]
*  But the other thing, of course, is that the Senate is so fundamentally, I think, separate [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=41.84s)]
*  from what people actually care about and what's actually going on in the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=45.72s)]
*  A lot of people are slapping, you know, patting themselves on the back for having spent another [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  $45 billion of taxpayer money and sent it to Ukraine, even as an amount of fentanyl [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=54.16s)]
*  that could kill not not thousands, but millions or billions of people continues to flow across [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=58.96s)]
*  our southern border every single month. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=64.2s)]
*  And now, of course, Joe Biden has issued an immigration executive order that would basically [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=65.72s)]
*  sweep these massive crowds of people under the rug. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=70.52s)]
*  It would hide them from cameras, but it wouldn't solve the fact that the country is being [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=74.04s)]
*  invaded at the invitation of the president of the United States. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=78.16s)]
*  So we've got a lot of problems, Tucker, and I think it's time for the Republicans to really [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=80.92s)]
*  use the next two years to fight and get some victories where we can and where we can't [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  get victories because, of course, Joe Biden is still president to at least hang the political [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=90.08s)]
*  consequences around the Democrats so that in 2024 we can actually go to the American [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  people and say, you know what, we tried to do something. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=100.56s)]
*  We tried to fix the problems. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=103.12s)]
*  We need something better in a president to make that happen. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  I have total confidence. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of our viewers have confidence and high hopes that you will be leading the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=110.64s)]
*  charge just not for anything crazy, but just to restore sanity to the country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=113.84s)]
*  But I have to ask you personally, so many people have come to Washington with those [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=117.36s)]
*  hopes and then they get completely captured not just by lobbyists, but in their heads. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=121.2s)]
*  They start caring about the dumb things that people in the city care about. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=125.12s)]
*  How are you going to keep your mind focused on the things that you were elected to do? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=128.4s)]
*  Well, I guess, Tucker, I just remember where I came from, and that's the promise that I [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=135.36s)]
*  make to the people of Ohio. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=138.88s)]
*  And I made it during the campaign trail. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=140.16s)]
*  You're not always going to agree with me, but I'm never going to forget where I come from. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, Tucker, you know how I grew up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=144.88s)]
*  I grew up from a poor family, an Appalachian family in southern Ohio. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=146.32s)]
*  We believed in this country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  We believed in its promise. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=152.08s)]
*  But we also recognize that a lot of people had been betrayed by their own government. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=153.28s)]
*  I'm not going to forget that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=157.28s)]
*  And the people who love me, the people who made me who I am, they're not going to let [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=158.4s)]
*  me forget it either. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=161.68s)]
*  So I think that's the thing that's going to separate me from the pack. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  That's going to make sure that I stay grounded in the things that people actually sent me [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  to Washington to accomplish. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=169.12s)]
*  And of course, I expect you and your viewers and everybody else to hold my feet to the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=170.72s)]
*  fire because we don't need people who rearrange the deck chairs as the country goes down. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=174.0s)]
*  We need people who actually are fighting to save an American way of life for the next [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=179.2s)]
*  generation. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=183.84s)]
*  That's why I'm doing this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=184.72s)]
*  There's no other reason to do it in my mind. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=185.84s)]
*  And I aim to do it with every single intention. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=188.0s)]
*  That's the plan, Tucker. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=190.72s)]
*  And you'll, I'm sure, keep me honest if I ever fall short. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=191.92s)]
*  Well, we sure appreciate it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=197.36s)]
*  JD Vance, with a few politicians I know personally, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=198.32s)]
*  who's not a BS artist. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=200.72s)]
*  So thank you and good luck. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=201.84s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfRJ8sMMuo&t=204.88s)]
