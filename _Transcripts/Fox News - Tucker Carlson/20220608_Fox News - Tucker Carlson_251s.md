# Lecturer resigns from Georgetown Law over Ketanji Brown Jackson controversy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik)
*  Until recently, Ilya Shapiro was a lecturer at Georgetown Law and one of the most prominent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=0.0s)]
*  Then he criticized Joe Biden's decision to nominate a Supreme Court justice on the basis [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=5.08s)]
*  of race, because race is irrelevant to judicial temperament, knowledge, experience, wisdom, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=9.88s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  For saying that, Georgetown Law put Shapiro on leave. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  They announced a months-long investigation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=21.0s)]
*  The probe ultimately cleared Shapiro on a technicality, but he says he's leaving the school anyway. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=23.48s)]
*  We are honored to have Ilya Shapiro, formerly of Georgetown Law. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=28.12s)]
*  He's the author of Supreme Disorder Judicial Elimination for the Politics of America's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=31.36s)]
*  Highest Court. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=34.28s)]
*  Ilya Shapiro joins us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=35.28s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming out. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  A lot of people followed this outside the legal world, outside the world of Georgetown. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Are we leaving anything out? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=44.68s)]
*  Was your crime just pointing out that race is irrelevant to whether a judge is good or [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=46.16s)]
*  not? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=50.92s)]
*  Look, I had a tweet that I didn't phrase as well as I would have liked. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=51.92s)]
*  I'm sure all of us are guilty of that at one time or another. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=56.92s)]
*  My underlying point is exactly as you stated, and I think it was unreasonable or with bad [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  faith to read it as being misogynistic or racist. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=66.28s)]
*  It's ironic that I'm being criticized, that I was criticized, that I was put under investigation [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=70.84s)]
*  for criticizing Joe Biden for applying a racial and gender-based test for his Supreme Court [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=75.72s)]
*  nominees. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=82.56s)]
*  Here we are, and four months later I was cleared on a technicality last week. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=83.8s)]
*  It took them four months, the investigators, at the diversity office and otherwise to see [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=89.56s)]
*  that I was not an employee when I tweeted, and they cleared me on that, but insinuated [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=94.78s)]
*  that I or anybody else who said or wrote anything that would offend anyone would be creating [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  a hostile educational establishment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=106.54s)]
*  And I could not work under that arrangement, and so I had to resign yesterday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=109.08s)]
*  Well, you made the honorable decision, and I admire that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  Working at Georgetown Law is considered a big deal. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=118.2s)]
*  I think what's scary about the story is this didn't happen at Nike, Wright, or the NFL, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  or something. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=124.92s)]
*  This happened at Georgetown Law, where there are a lot of serious people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=125.92s)]
*  I know a lot of people who work there. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=127.52s)]
*  Weren't they embarrassed to be investigating you for expressing an entirely mainstream [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=130.32s)]
*  and defensible position on Twitter? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm not going to speak for anyone else, but I think nationwide, and in Georgetown [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=137.84s)]
*  specifically, there are a lot of cowardly administrators who refuse to stand up to the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  activist radical woke mob who insists that there is no deviation from a progressive orthodoxy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=149.48s)]
*  I mean, contrary to the diversity, equity, inclusion offices that have proliferated throughout [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=157.76s)]
*  the land, they're encouraging, they're discouraging intellectual diversity, preventing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=163.14s)]
*  equal opportunity, and excluding any voices that would dissent from the prevailing view. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=169.33999999999997s)]
*  So I've been really disappointed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=176.1s)]
*  I'm sad that this has all happened. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=178.98s)]
*  I don't think I was naive, but I mean, it's really, really bad. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=180.66s)]
*  I don't think any faculty member, staff member, student at such an institution can [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=184.89999999999998s)]
*  really thrive because there's a sword of Damocles, and that's why I left. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=191.29999999999998s)]
*  I could not stay at a place where if I'm commenting on a Supreme Court opinion or teaching a class, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=196.94s)]
*  and someone says they're uncomfortable or claims they're offended, and all of a sudden [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=202.98s)]
*  I'm back in the Sarm chamber. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=207.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's the end of a great American institution after hundreds of years, and it's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  bigger even than your particular case. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=214.18s)]
*  It says something really ominous, I think. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=216.54s)]
*  And I appreciate you being willing to talk about it in the principled stand that you [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=218.62s)]
*  have taken. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=221.18s)]
*  And to let you know, Tucker, my next move, I'm now going to be the director of constitutional [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=222.18s)]
*  studies at the Manhattan Institute, which is a wonderful organization based in New York. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=227.26s)]
*  I'm going to stay in the DC area in Northern Virginia where I live, and they do a lot of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=232.34s)]
*  ... They make a lot of great counterintuitive points on policy, and I'm delighted to expand [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=237.9s)]
*  their constitutional program. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=242.84s)]
*  Amen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=243.84s)]
*  Work with a lot of people who have been friends for a long time. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=244.84s)]
*  We'll see you again. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=248.22s)]
*  Nealey Shapiro, thank you so much. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=249.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPojvj1snik&t=250.22s)]
