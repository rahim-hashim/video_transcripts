# Tulsi Gabbard reacts to Romney accusing her of 'treasonous lies'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks)
*  Tulsi Gabbard knows very well what wise assessments of crises look like. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=0.0s)]
*  Mitt Romney says she should be arrested for it, but she hasn't been yet, so she joins [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=6.48s)]
*  us tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=9.76s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=10.76s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=12.6s)]
*  What would be your response to Mitt Romney? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=14.6s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think it's important to point out here that this is not a matter [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=18.04s)]
*  of disagreement or holding a dissenting view. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=23.68s)]
*  This is about facts, and this is about the truth. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=27.36s)]
*  So while Senator Romney and all these different talking heads in the mainstream media are [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=30.52s)]
*  regurgitating Hillary Clinton's slanderous talking points, the facts remain. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=35.76s)]
*  Number one is they're accusing me of saying that somehow there are bioweapons labs in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=41.16s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=46.36s)]
*  I've said no such thing at any point. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=47.36s)]
*  I have said that there are biolabs in Ukraine that have received U.S. support that contain [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  dangerous pathogens, that if those labs are breached, then we in the world are facing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=55.8s)]
*  a potential future of pandemics, that this is a dangerous crisis that needs to be addressed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=62.4s)]
*  immediately, these pathogens need to be destroyed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=67.0s)]
*  The second thing they're saying is they deny, even though there is a plethora of evidence [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=70.24s)]
*  that exists, they deny that these biolabs are even there, which is shocking to me, that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=75.12s)]
*  we've heard over and over. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=80.2s)]
*  You played so many clips from people in the mainstream media are saying these biolabs, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=81.4s)]
*  these supposed biolabs, as though there's some fantasy, when over and over and over [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=85.76s)]
*  again officials from our own government, Department of State, Department of Defense and so on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=90.12s)]
*  are saying these biolabs in Ukraine have dangerous pathogens and we're very concerned that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=95.4s)]
*  they may be breached. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=102.44s)]
*  That's the concern that I've continued to raise because it is not left or right, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=104.2s)]
*  Democrat or Republican. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  This is a serious safety and health and life concern for the American people and people [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  around the world. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  And so the media is lying. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  They're not only lying about this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=118.4s)]
*  You saw headlines a couple of days ago, Tulsi Gabbard paid off by Russian agent. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=120.48s)]
*  What the media is lying about is the fact that an American citizen gave my campaign [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=126.12s)]
*  a $59 contribution coming from a woman I've never met, never talked to, don't know, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  don't know anything about. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=137.16s)]
*  But somehow they feel justified in saying Tulsi Gabbard is being paid off. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=139.34s)]
*  The danger in the media lying so blatantly to the American people, these so-called journalists [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=144.0s)]
*  who have a responsibility to the public, poses a very direct threat to our Democratic Republic [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=149.12s)]
*  because they continue to get away with it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  They continue to parrot and propagate these lies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=156.8s)]
*  And they need to be held accountable. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  They need to be exposed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, the U.S. government has said that there are bioweapons in Ukraine, there [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  are Soviet-era bioweapons that we are going to destroy that we haven't. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=168.44s)]
*  So they've said that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  We're just responding to what they have said. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=173.04s)]
*  But I wonder if you just quickly assess the way that people are thinking is what scares [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=175.64s)]
*  me most. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=179.12s)]
*  We can debate about what we believe the facts are. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=180.12s)]
*  But if we're incapable of thinking rationally, if our first instinct is to denounce something [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  we don't like as treasonous propaganda and call for a jail sentence, I mean, what, you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=186.84s)]
*  know, who's leading this country? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think it's important to recognize that facts exist, especially in this case. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  And the truth is the first casualty of war. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=202.16s)]
*  And so this is exactly what we are seeing here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  People have a very specific agenda, refusing to recognize the truth, refusing to have a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  conversation and instead immediately resorting to their age-old tactic of silence, smear [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  and destroy the character and reputation of anyone who dares to say anything that they [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  don't like. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=224.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=225.68s)]
*  Well, thank you for not being bowed. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=226.68s)]
*  I mean, if you care about the country, you clearly do. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=228.64s)]
*  You know, you've got to be honest and try your best to think about the wisest course [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  forward, period, regardless of what they call you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=235.16s)]
*  And I'm just grateful that you are doing that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=237.72s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQYP6v4bBks&t=239.48s)]
