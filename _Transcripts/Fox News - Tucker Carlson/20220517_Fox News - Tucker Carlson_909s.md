# Tucker: These people are lunatics
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ)
*  First, good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Last May, a 17 year old high school senior [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=3.08s)]
*  called Peyton Gendron received an assignment [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=5.38s)]
*  in his economics class. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=7.48s)]
*  The assignment asked, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  what do you want to do when you retire? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=9.96s)]
*  He answered, commit murder, suicide. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=12.36s)]
*  Gendron's teacher immediately reported his threat [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=15.6s)]
*  to authorities who sent him to the emergency room [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  for a psychiatric evaluation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  Gendron was there for just 20 hours. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=21.76s)]
*  As he wrote later in his diary, quote, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=24.16s)]
*  I got out of it because I stuck with the story [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=25.96s)]
*  that I was getting out of class [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=28.36s)]
*  and I just stupidly wrote that down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=29.76s)]
*  That's the reason I believe [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=31.6s)]
*  I am still able to purchase guns. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=32.88s)]
*  But he was lying. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=35.28s)]
*  Gendron's intention to commit mass murder [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=36.68s)]
*  was as he later wrote, quote, not a joke. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=38.56s)]
*  I wrote that down because that's what I was planning to do. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=41.36s)]
*  And he was. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=44.800000000000004s)]
*  Peyton Gendron was mentally ill. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=46.1s)]
*  His classmates knew that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=47.84s)]
*  Gendron made strange facial expressions [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=49.08s)]
*  and said odd things in class. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Last year, he showed up for school [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=53.160000000000004s)]
*  for a full week wearing a hazmat suit. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=54.56s)]
*  Boots, gloves, everything recalled another student. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=57.16s)]
*  Police and school administrators understood perfectly well [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  that Gendron was potentially dangerous. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=63.059999999999995s)]
*  That's why they sent him to the psych ward. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=64.88s)]
*  Even his own parents must have known [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=67.0s)]
*  that something was very wrong. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=68.7s)]
*  Gendron's diary describes how his mother [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=70.4s)]
*  helped him bury a cat he had beaten to death [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=72.36s)]
*  in their garage and then beheaded with a hatchet. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=75.2s)]
*  On Saturday, Peyton Gendron, as you know, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=78.44s)]
*  finally did what he said he would do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=80.34s)]
*  He committed mass murder. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=82.12s)]
*  He opened fire on a crowd of strangers [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=83.24s)]
*  in a Buffalo supermarket. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=85.3s)]
*  He murdered 10 of them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=86.6s)]
*  So how did the adults around him let this happen? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=88.52s)]
*  In a country with functioning leadership, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=91.96s)]
*  we would be asking that question. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  The signs of mental illness were certainly there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=95.52s)]
*  The people in charge missed those signs [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  or didn't take them seriously enough, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  weren't paying close enough attention. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  In any case, they didn't fix it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=103.32s)]
*  They let a killer slip through. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=104.56s)]
*  So what did they do wrong with Peyton Gendron [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=106.96s)]
*  and how can we learn from it? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=109.84s)]
*  We should learn from it [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=112.02s)]
*  if we want to prevent more mass murders. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=113.08s)]
*  But that's not at all what our leaders [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=116.08s)]
*  are asking tonight, hardly. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  Instead, they're asking the only question [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=118.94s)]
*  that ever occurs to them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=120.64s)]
*  How exactly can I benefit from this? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=122.34s)]
*  How can I leverage this tragedy to my advantage? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=124.88s)]
*  How can other people's suffering make me more powerful? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=128.2s)]
*  It didn't take long for Joe Biden to find a way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=132.4s)]
*  Biden flew to Buffalo this morning [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=134.96s)]
*  to speak about what Peyton Gendron did. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=136.32s)]
*  There've been a number of mass murders [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=138.96s)]
*  since Biden became president. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=140.4s)]
*  Some of them have been racially motivated. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=141.76s)]
*  Little over a year ago, in fact, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=143.84s)]
*  there was even another supermarket massacre [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=145.04s)]
*  that happened to have the same casualty total. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=147.16s)]
*  A Syrian-born man murdered 10 people in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=149.88s)]
*  Even used the same caliber rifle [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=153.12s)]
*  that Peyton Gendron brought to Buffalo. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=154.88s)]
*  But Joe Biden didn't bother to fly to that crime scene. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=157.64s)]
*  He didn't go to any of them, in fact. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=160.04s)]
*  Biden went to Buffalo today [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=162.04s)]
*  because he thought he could blame his political opponents [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=163.28s)]
*  for what happened there, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=165.68s)]
*  which of course he promptly did. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=168.56s)]
*  And other nations ask me, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=170.04s)]
*  heads of state in other countries, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=171.68s)]
*  ask me, what's going on? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=173.76s)]
*  What in God's name happened on January 6th? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=177.92s)]
*  What happened in Buffalo? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=180.92s)]
*  They ask. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=181.76s)]
*  January 6th and the Buffalo massacre. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=185.4s)]
*  So how is a political protest at the Capitol [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=189.04s)]
*  related to a murder spree by a demented teenager [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=191.88s)]
*  in New York state over the weekend? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  What do those two events have in common? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=196.4s)]
*  And who exactly are these unnamed heads of state [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=198.44s)]
*  who are connecting these non-connected events [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=201.32s)]
*  in conversations with Joe Biden? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=204.12s)]
*  You may have wondered that, but don't ask. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=206.4s)]
*  Because it's not meant to be asked. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=208.2s)]
*  It is instead a dream sequence. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=209.4s)]
*  It's a rhetorical device meant to connect [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=210.72s)]
*  everything that might challenge Joe Biden [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=213.16s)]
*  and bunch all these things together [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=215.32s)]
*  in the same repulsive moral category. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=217.16s)]
*  January 6th, mass murder, the bubonic plague, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=219.96s)]
*  it's all the same, it's all bad. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=222.24s)]
*  And because it's bad, Joe Biden informed us today, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=224.24s)]
*  after 250 years, we're going to have to suspend [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=227.08s)]
*  the Bill of Rights. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=229.6s)]
*  We're going to begin where the Bill of Rights begins, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=230.48s)]
*  with the freedom of speech. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  You can't prevent people from being radicalized to violence. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=235.12s)]
*  But we can address the relentless exploitation [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=238.56s)]
*  of the internet to recruit and mobilize terrorism. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=241.92s)]
*  The relentless exploitation of the internet [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=246.72s)]
*  to recruit and mobilize terrorism. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=249.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=252.92s)]
*  But can anyone show, has anyone ever shown [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=254.12s)]
*  that this specific case, Payton Gendron, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=256.76s)]
*  was, quote, recruited and mobilized by the internet? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=260.68s)]
*  Well, no, in fact. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  By his own account, he was mentally ill. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=264.44s)]
*  He snapped, he'd been planning this for a long time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=267.56s)]
*  He did what his diseased brain commanded him to do. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  The internet did not make him do it, he did it himself. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=272.8s)]
*  But even if Gendron had been, quote, radicalized [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=275.76000000000005s)]
*  by what he read on the internet, what then exactly? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  Many have been radicalized by what they've read. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=282.68s)]
*  Paul Pot was radicalized by reading Das Kapitel. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=285.24s)]
*  He went on a murder spree. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  He killed more than a million people. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  Should we ban that book? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=291.24s)]
*  Should we ban all books? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=292.88000000000005s)]
*  All internet sites that, quote, radicalize people? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=294.88000000000005s)]
*  What exactly is Joe Biden saying here? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, he's saying that thanks to what happened [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  in Buffalo over the weekend, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=301.56s)]
*  you no longer have any rights at all, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  including the most basic, which is to read what you want. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=304.6s)]
*  After nullifying the First Amendment, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=308.04s)]
*  Joe Biden moved to the Second Amendment. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  The venom of the haters and their weapons of war, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  the violence and the words and deeds [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=317.56s)]
*  that stalk our streets, our stores, our schools. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=320.92s)]
*  This venom, this violence cannot be the story of our time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=324.44s)]
*  But there are certain things we can do. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=329.92s)]
*  We can keep assault weapons off our streets. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=332.88s)]
*  We've done it before. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=335.92s)]
*  So because a mentally ill 18-year-old [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=339.2s)]
*  used a specific rifle to commit these crimes, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=341.76s)]
*  you can't have that rifle. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=344.28s)]
*  Now, Joe Biden's bodyguards can have that rifle, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=345.96s)]
*  so can Nancy Pelosi's, and of course they do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=348.32s)]
*  In fact, you pay for it all. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=350.84s)]
*  But they're important and you are not, so you can't. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=352.52s)]
*  So because the people in charge [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=356.28s)]
*  fail to protect shoppers in Buffalo, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  you're not allowed to defend your family, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=359.2s)]
*  despite the fact you may believe your family's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=360.84s)]
*  every bit as important as Joe Biden and his family [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=362.64s)]
*  and Nancy Pelosi and her family. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=365.0s)]
*  But they're not as important. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  So we're going to defund the police and disarm you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=369.24s)]
*  That's how it works now, sorry. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=372.44s)]
*  And then Joe Biden got to the main point of his speech, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=374.88s)]
*  which is that people who criticize his immigration policies [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=377.24s)]
*  are responsible for the violence you saw in Buffalo. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=380.36s)]
*  Here's the president of the United States explaining that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=383.44s)]
*  I hate that through the media and politics, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=386.8s)]
*  the internet has radicalized angry, alienated, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=391.4s)]
*  lost and isolated individuals into falsely believing [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=395.44s)]
*  that they will be replaced. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=400.2s)]
*  That's the word replaced by the other. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=401.48s)]
*  And I condemn those who spread the lie for power, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=405.72s)]
*  political gain and for profit. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=410.16s)]
*  So you lock the country down, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=414.0s)]
*  lock kids out of their schools for two years, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=416.04s)]
*  force them to get, quote, educated on the internet, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=419.56s)]
*  but it's someone else's fault that they're, quote, alienated. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=422.72s)]
*  They've been hearing about the great replacement theory. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=426.48s)]
*  You've heard a lot about the great replacement theory [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  recently, it's everywhere in the last two days. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=432.12s)]
*  And we're still unsure exactly what it is. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=434.44s)]
*  Here's what we do know for a fact. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=436.88s)]
*  There is a strong political component [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=439.12s)]
*  to the democratic party's immigration policy. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=441.48s)]
*  We're not guessing this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=443.68s)]
*  We know this and we know it because they have said so. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=445.08000000000004s)]
*  They've said it again and again and again. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=448.2s)]
*  They've written books on it and monographs [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=450.92s)]
*  and magazine articles. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=453.36s)]
*  They've bragged about it endlessly. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=454.52s)]
*  They talk about it on cable news constantly. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=455.92s)]
*  And they say out loud, we are doing this [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=458.48s)]
*  because it helps us to win elections. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=460.8s)]
*  That's not something you said once, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=463.36s)]
*  it's something they've gloated about [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  again and again and again. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=466.36s)]
*  And we think that's wrong. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=468.04s)]
*  And in case you doubt us, here they are. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  Blue Wave is African-American. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  It's white, it's Latino, it's Asian Pacific Islander. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=476.48s)]
*  It is made up of those who've been told [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=479.24s)]
*  that they are not worthy of being here. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=481.16s)]
*  It is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=484.0s)]
*  In a couple of presidential cycles, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=487.0s)]
*  you'll be on election night. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=488.68s)]
*  You'll be announcing that we're calling [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=490.36s)]
*  the 38 electoral votes of Texas [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=492.0s)]
*  for the Democratic nominee for president. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=494.12s)]
*  It's changing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=496.32s)]
*  It's gonna become a purple state and then a blue state [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=497.4s)]
*  because of the demographics. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=500.0s)]
*  The demographics of America are not on the side [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=501.24s)]
*  of the Republican party. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=503.76s)]
*  The new voters in this country are moving away from them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=506.04s)]
*  And instead, they're moving to be independents [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=509.92s)]
*  or to even vote on the other side. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=513.04s)]
*  An unrelenting stream of immigration, nonstop, nonstop. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=514.96s)]
*  Folks like me who were Caucasian of European descent [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=522.12s)]
*  for the first time in 2017 will be in an absolute minority [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=526.6s)]
*  in the United States of America, absolute minority. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=531.2s)]
*  Fewer than 50% of the people in America from then and on [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=535.24s)]
*  will be white European stock. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=540.12s)]
*  That's not a bad thing. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=543.5999999999999s)]
*  That's a source of our strength. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  So you play clips of them saying it [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  and you're the deranged conspiracy nut. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=552.16s)]
*  Maybe the funniest part is they may not be right. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=555.64s)]
*  The Democratic party has decided that rather than convince you, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=558.2399999999999s)]
*  people who are born here, that their policies are helping you [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  and making the country better and stronger, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=565.4s)]
*  they will change the electorate. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=567.64s)]
*  Again, they say that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=568.9599999999999s)]
*  We're not guessing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=570.56s)]
*  But the funniest part is they may be wrong, actually, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=572.32s)]
*  judging by recent polling. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=575.08s)]
*  It turns out your average Salvadoran landscaper [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=576.32s)]
*  has politics that are a lot closer to Donald Trump's [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=578.72s)]
*  than they are to Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=581.2s)]
*  So their basic calculation may be completely wrong. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=583.08s)]
*  But that's not even the point. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  It has nothing to do with who we're letting in. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=587.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with race and ethnicity. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=588.6s)]
*  It has to do with two things. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=590.2800000000001s)]
*  One, the purpose of the US government [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=591.36s)]
*  is to serve American citizens, period. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=593.72s)]
*  And two, you should never craft any federal, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=596.36s)]
*  which is to say nationwide policy [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=600.6s)]
*  in order to help a specific political party. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=602.9200000000001s)]
*  That is by itself in isolation immoral. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=605.32s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the policy is. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=608.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what they're doing. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=611.24s)]
*  And again, they brag about it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=613.24s)]
*  And not just Democratic party politicians. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=614.76s)]
*  Virtually every media figure on the left [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=617.12s)]
*  has been bragging about this for decades. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=619.64s)]
*  Oh, it's a conspiracy theory. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=623.4s)]
*  Well, here's Anna Navarro from her time as a Harvard fellow. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=624.24s)]
*  This is what she wrote, quote, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=627.0s)]
*  the demographic trends show that the minority vote [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=628.32s)]
*  in the United States will continue to grow [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=630.4s)]
*  in numbers and influence. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=632.0s)]
*  Unless you're under the influence of hallucinogens, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=633.56s)]
*  it is hard to imagine future scenarios [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=635.48s)]
*  where the Republican party can win national elections. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=637.4s)]
*  That piece, by the way, is called [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=639.92s)]
*  old white straight male voters [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=641.6s)]
*  ain't what they used to be, end quote. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=643.76s)]
*  So let's see, if you don't want people [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=646.64s)]
*  to be paranoid and angry, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=648.24s)]
*  maybe you don't write pieces like that [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=649.72s)]
*  and rub it right in their face [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=651.28s)]
*  and give them the finger day after day. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=652.68s)]
*  Maybe that would deescalate it a little bit. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=654.88s)]
*  You think, Joe Biden, Anna Navarro? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=656.92s)]
*  But they're not the only two. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=659.72s)]
*  This has been the prevailing view [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=660.72s)]
*  on the left for a long time. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=662.0400000000001s)]
*  Here's a political piece from 2013. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=663.44s)]
*  We could go on for hours by the way, but here's this, quote, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  immigration reform could be a bonanza for Democrats. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=667.52s)]
*  The Democratic party, the piece said, are quote, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=671.36s)]
*  pumping as many as 11 million new Hispanic voters [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=673.84s)]
*  into the electorate a decade from now [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=676.52s)]
*  in ways that could produce an electoral bonanza [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=678.64s)]
*  for Democrats and cripple Republican prospects [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=680.88s)]
*  in many states they now win easily, end quote. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=683.84s)]
*  Again, as noted, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=686.96s)]
*  that calculation may be completely wrong. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=688.4s)]
*  A lot of those people that Democrats are importing [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=690.8s)]
*  may wind up being deeply sympathetic to the other party [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=693.0799999999999s)]
*  because they're actually not white liberals. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=696.48s)]
*  That's the secret. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  But it almost doesn't matter how they vote. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=700.3199999999999s)]
*  Thinking about politics in those terms is immoral. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=702.1999999999999s)]
*  That is wrong. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=705.36s)]
*  You are gaming the system. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=706.1999999999999s)]
*  That is not democracy. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=707.36s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=708.4s)]
*  And they bragged about it for more than a decade. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=709.24s)]
*  Here's another example, also from 2013. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=711.4s)]
*  The Center for American Progress announced that, quote, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=713.88s)]
*  supporting real immigration reform [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=716.44s)]
*  that contains a pathway to citizenship [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=718.12s)]
*  for our nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=719.92s)]
*  is the only way to maintain electoral strength [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=722.2s)]
*  in the future. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=725.52s)]
*  Oh, great replacement theory, anyone? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=726.72s)]
*  These people are lunatics. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=731.5s)]
*  They're telling you what their strategy is. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=733.46s)]
*  When you note it, they scream at you and call you a criminal. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=736.28s)]
*  In 2018, the New York Times published an editorial called, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=739.36s)]
*  We can replace them. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=741.92s)]
*  Just in case subtlety is not your thing. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=744.68s)]
*  Quote, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=746.4399999999999s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=756.52s)]
*  In 2020, Joe Scarborough, a real moral voice over at MSNBC, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=757.72s)]
*  quoted this, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=761.28s)]
*  Are you allowed to say that? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=770.32s)]
*  Once again, they're wrong. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=771.46s)]
*  And if you haven't looked at an electoral map recently, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  look at the districts, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=777.4200000000001s)]
*  the almost 100% Hispanic districts in the Rio Grande Valley [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=778.46s)]
*  that are bearing the brunt of our open borders, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=782.22s)]
*  they're now red. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=785.14s)]
*  So you're wrong, Joe Scarborough, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=786.48s)]
*  but the fact that you're saying demographics is destiny [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=787.74s)]
*  tells you the great replacement theory [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=790.1800000000001s)]
*  is coming from the left. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=792.62s)]
*  They don't think it's a theory, they think it's real. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=793.88s)]
*  In 2021, the Washington Post's Jen Rubin [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=795.82s)]
*  celebrated a report that the number of white people [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=798.58s)]
*  in this country was declining. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=800.74s)]
*  Can you even imagine? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=801.62s)]
*  Quote, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=802.7s)]
*  My God, talking like that, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=808.86s)]
*  is there any more divisive thing you could write? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=811.0600000000001s)]
*  We could give you a million more examples. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=814.5s)]
*  We're offended by this because it's wrong, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=816.9s)]
*  and we've said so. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=819.42s)]
*  But for saying so, according to Carl Cameron on MSNBC today, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=820.92s)]
*  we should be thrown in jail. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=825.22s)]
*  Watch. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=826.84s)]
*  We're purveyors of misinformation. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=830.78s)]
*  And when our two-party system is broken like that, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=832.94s)]
*  democracy is seriously in trouble. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=836.94s)]
*  The president acknowledged that it's time [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=838.94s)]
*  to actually start doing things and maybe taking some names [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=841.86s)]
*  and putting people in jail. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=844.9s)]
*  Maybe taking some names and putting people in jail. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=846.78s)]
*  Who would those people be? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=850.54s)]
*  Well, thanks to the Senate Majority Leader [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=851.86s)]
*  Chuck Schumer of New York, we now know. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=854.26s)]
*  Schumer just sent a letter to our bosses here at Fox News, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=856.32s)]
*  blaming this show for the mass murder in Buffalo, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=859.18s)]
*  as well as several other mass shootings in recent years. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=861.8599999999999s)]
*  According to Chuck Schumer, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=865.04s)]
*  this show spreads, quote, dangerous rhetoric [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=866.14s)]
*  and needs to be pulled off the air immediately [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=868.3s)]
*  in the name of public safety. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=870.3s)]
*  Now again, Chuck Schumer is a federal official. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=872.38s)]
*  He is the leading Democrat in the United States Senate, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=875.26s)]
*  and he is calling for media censorship. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=878.5799999999999s)]
*  Now, there was a time, like maybe 18 months ago, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=880.76s)]
*  and that would be considered a direct violation [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=883.3399999999999s)]
*  of the First Amendment. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=884.9s)]
*  Now, we hear it every day. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=885.74s)]
*  Let's throw them in jail. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=886.8399999999999s)]
*  We wanted to hear more from Chuck Schumer about this. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=888.6s)]
*  We invited him on the show tonight, as we always do. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=891.4200000000001s)]
*  And because he is a coward, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=894.2s)]
*  this is the only media appearance, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=895.24s)]
*  probably in history, he's turned down. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=898.58s)]
*  to catch our nightly opens, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=900.9200000000001s)]

*  and changing your life. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=904.96s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzgfBMVwFQ&t=906.6800000000001s)]
