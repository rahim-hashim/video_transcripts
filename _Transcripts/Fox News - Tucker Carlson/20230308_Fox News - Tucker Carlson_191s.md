# Female powerlifter tells Tucker having to compete against trans opponents is outrageous
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4)
*  It's International Women's Day! Hooray! Unfortunately, it no longer means anything. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=0.0s)]
*  The final victory of feminism is erasing women as an entire category. They don't even exist [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=7.08s)]
*  anymore. Literally. It's kind of funny. Women getting lectured by men about the pains of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  menstruation. That's the final victory of feminism. Well, a Minnesota judge called Patrick [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=20.8s)]
*  Diamond has just ruled that USA powerlifting must allow men to compete against women, and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=25.2s)]
*  as you'd expect, powerlifting groups are now warning this will effectively end competitive [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=30.44s)]
*  powerlifting for women. We thought we would speak to a competitive female powerlifter, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  April Hutchinson, represents Team Canada. She joins us tonight. April, thank you. I'm sorry [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  to laugh. This is actually a very sad story, and I'm just wondering how you feel about it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=42.32s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me, Tucker. How are we feeling? The women of powerlifting are, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=45.68s)]
*  we're outraged, we're angry, we're hurt, we're offended. We're basically every emotion except [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=52.96s)]
*  we're happy. I just don't, I know you're not supposed to criticize trans anybody, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=60.28s)]
*  but here's a guy who's horning into your sport and wrecking it. Like, I don't know why he has [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=65.4s)]
*  to be a hero. That's appalling. Who would do something like that? What's this guy's problem, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=70.8s)]
*  do you think? You know what? I don't even know if it's so much the person, right? It's the policy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=74.44s)]
*  At the end of the day, the policy is allowing him to compete. Would I feel good about myself [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  if I was a male taking female records and putting him in spots? Exactly. No. Well, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=89.28s)]
*  that's it. You're right. Obviously, he's a troubled person, and I don't want to be mean, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=95.28s)]
*  but it's just so awful to do that to you. You're brave enough to come on the show. I'm [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=98.84s)]
*  certain you'll be punished for it, so you must really mean it if you're willing to. Do you know [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  any other female powerlifters who support this? Well, that's the thing. If I didn't do anything [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=109.4s)]
*  about it, I mean, there was times where I couldn't sleep at night. I mean, I've been battling this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=115.4s)]
*  for about two years now. Finally, women are coming out. I get daily emails and messages from women [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=119.28s)]
*  saying, thank you so much for standing up for women in sports. A lot of women are silenced and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  feel silenced and that they have no voice or they're afraid to speak up, the fear of maybe [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=130.56s)]
*  getting kicked out of the federation to be called names for backlash. But no, we're growing stronger [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=135.72s)]
*  and louder, and the amount of support is overwhelming, actually. I have to just ask, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=143.24s)]
*  since you are a woman, having a man lecture you about what it's like to be a female powerlifter, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=148.84s)]
*  is that empowering for you? No. Honestly, it's crazy. I say this every day. I [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  talked to my boyfriend about this and I said, I can't believe we're actually having this debate [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=165.04s)]
*  in this conversation in 2023. The trans movement is the ultimate mansplaining ever invented. It's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=168.68s)]
*  just unbelievable. April Hutchinson, thank you for coming on. Great to see you. Thank you so much. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnN6SdlwEq4&t=176.08s)]
