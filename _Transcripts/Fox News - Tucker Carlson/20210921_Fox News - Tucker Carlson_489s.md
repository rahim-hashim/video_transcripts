# Tucker: Biden did this on purpose
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo)
*  Parts of our country are already very poor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=0.0s)]
*  Leave Martha's Vineyard sometime and you'll discover that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=3.34s)]
*  America could be on the brink of getting much poorer. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=6.82s)]
*  This is the last thing we need. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=9.38s)]
*  And it was preventable, very easily preventable. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=12.5s)]
*  The United States government holds tremendous sway [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=15.38s)]
*  over the Mexican economy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=17.92s)]
*  So with a single phone call, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=19.78s)]
*  Joe Biden could have made absolutely certain [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=21.34s)]
*  that the Mexican government sent these migrants back [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=23.54s)]
*  to where they came from. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=25.78s)]
*  But Joe Biden has not called to do that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=27.46s)]
*  And he hasn't because he wants these migrants here [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=29.88s)]
*  in the United States and so they are coming. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=32.44s)]
*  He did this on purpose. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=34.64s)]
*  Thousands of Haitians, as you just saw, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=36.96s)]
*  have swarmed Del Rio, Texas, which is not a big town. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=38.72s)]
*  As of this morning, there were close to 7,000 [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=41.96s)]
*  so-called family units under the bridge there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=44.08s)]
*  More than 300 of those units included a pregnant woman. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=46.68s)]
*  All of these migrants, says the Biden administration, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  will be allowed to stay in the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=52.96s)]
*  No questions asked. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  And the children born here will, of course, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  instantly become American citizens. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=57.36000000000001s)]
*  None of these people, you should know this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=59.88s)]
*  because it's telling, will undergo any kind [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  of background check, like the background check you would endure [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=64.08s)]
*  if you were to try to say buy a 12 gauge [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=66.92s)]
*  according to your constitutional rights. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=69.14s)]
*  None of them either will be forced to abide [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=71.92s)]
*  by vaccine mandates. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=74.14s)]
*  So you need the shot to work as a nurse [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=75.92s)]
*  or for the sanitation department or anywhere. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=77.76s)]
*  But you don't need a shot to come into our country illegally [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=80.38s)]
*  at the request of the Biden administration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=83.76s)]
*  Virtually none of these migrants will ever be deported. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=86.42s)]
*  Of the more than 3000 illegals processed in Del Rio [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=88.7s)]
*  on Sunday, only 327 were supposedly deported to Haiti. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=91.7s)]
*  All of them single men and women. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=95.98s)]
*  We haven't, by the way, confirmed that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=97.34s)]
*  That's just the claim. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=98.7s)]
*  But even the official claim tells us [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=100.26s)]
*  that more than 90% of these Haitians [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=103.14000000000001s)]
*  got effective amnesty immediately. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=105.5s)]
*  They got on government buses to resettle [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  into what was until recently your country. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=110.18s)]
*  On Monday, Haitians on one of those buses revolted [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=113.84s)]
*  and took control of the vehicle. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=116.5s)]
*  They did break out of the bus and they did escape, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=118.22s)]
*  one official told the Washington Examiner. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=120.26s)]
*  Do things seem out of control? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's because they are. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=124.62s)]
*  Just a few hours ago, the head of DHS, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  the man in charge of Homeland Security, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=128.78s)]
*  explained to the United States Congress [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=132.2s)]
*  that in fact he has no idea how many foreign nationals [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=133.86s)]
*  are being resettled in American neighborhoods. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  And he didn't seem bothered to admit that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=139.42000000000002s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=141.1s)]
*  How many people have been returned? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=142.58s)]
*  How many people are being detained? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  How many people have been dispersed [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  to all points around America? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=148.24s)]
*  Senator, I would be pleased to provide you with that data. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=150.72000000000003s)]
*  I want them now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=153.0s)]
*  Why don't you have that information now? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=154.36s)]
*  Senator, I do not have that data. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=156.24s)]
*  Why not? Why me? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=157.84s)]
*  Why don't you have that basic information? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=159.08s)]
*  Senator, I want to be accurate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=161.4s)]
*  Because he doesn't care. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=164.4s)]
*  That's why he doesn't have the information. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  Because he doesn't care. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=166.52s)]
*  Because there's nothing you can do about it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=167.36s)]
*  There's nothing Ron Johnson, despite his best [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=168.44s)]
*  and noble efforts can do about it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  So how could you defend this if you believed in, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  let's say, law? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=175.94000000000003s)]
*  How would you defend what's happening? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, you couldn't. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=179.9s)]
*  There's no way to defend it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=180.74s)]
*  These are illegal aliens. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=182.34s)]
*  They're not refugees. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=183.62s)]
*  They are breaking the law [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=184.62s)]
*  with the help of the federal government. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=185.68s)]
*  How is that okay? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=187.9s)]
*  Well, no one in the Democratic Party [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  bothers to explain how it's okay. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=191.22000000000003s)]
*  Instead, they deflect. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=193.78000000000003s)]
*  They denounce anyone who asks and calls that person a, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=194.82000000000002s)]
*  can you guess? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=198.66000000000003s)]
*  Can you guess what they call people who ask questions? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=199.5s)]
*  Here's Ilhan Omar to remind you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=202.08s)]
*  What we have seen was cruel in Himein [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=204.88s)]
*  and a violation of domestic laws and international laws. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=208.2s)]
*  We owe Haitians the right thing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=212.32s)]
*  of allowing them to seek asylum here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=216.96s)]
*  When it comes to our immigration policy for so many years, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  cruelty has been very much embedded in it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=225.34s)]
*  There is obviously systematic racism at play here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=230.58s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  So it's systematic racism to point out lawbreaking [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=236.9s)]
*  by foreign nationals, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  says the lady who married her own brother [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=242.02s)]
*  in order to scam American immigration law. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  Now somehow, Ilhan Omar is a, quote, lawmaker, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=248.36s)]
*  and she's calling you a racist [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=251.94s)]
*  if you don't like the fact that as a lawmaker, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=253.84s)]
*  she is openly subverting the laws of the country [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=256.16s)]
*  that rescued her from a refugee camp in Kenya. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=258.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=262.32s)]
*  That's the new America. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=264.2s)]
*  And it's not just Ilhan Omar who's saying it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=265.72s)]
*  Here's the top Democrat in the United States Senate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=267.48s)]
*  Images of Haitian migrants being hit with whips [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=270.12s)]
*  and other forms of physical violence [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=272.96s)]
*  is completely unacceptable. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=275.64s)]
*  Right now, I'm told there are four flights scheduled [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=277.92s)]
*  to deport these asylum seekers back to a country [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=281.12s)]
*  that cannot receive them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  Such a decision defies common sense. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=285.76s)]
*  It also defies common decency. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=288.6s)]
*  So I urge President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  to immediately put a stop to these expulsions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=294.6s)]
*  These people are such liars, especially that guy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=298.44s)]
*  So here you have Chuck Schumer claiming that there are, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=301.12s)]
*  quote, images of Haitian migrants being hit with whips. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=303.42s)]
*  Well, that's a distressing claim. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Really, where are these images? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=309.44s)]
*  We checked and we couldn't find a single picture like that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=311.64s)]
*  Instead, we saw border patrol officers using their reins [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=315.84s)]
*  to control their horses. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=319.6s)]
*  Horses have reins. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=322.08s)]
*  Reins are not whips. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=323.36s)]
*  Though if you live in Dupont Circle, it's possible [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=324.96s)]
*  you wouldn't know the difference. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=326.92s)]
*  We saw that image of at least one border patrol agent [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=329.14s)]
*  using a whip and was effectively trying to lasso [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=331.44s)]
*  some of the migrants. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=335.08s)]
*  I was not aware that whips, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=335.92s)]
*  which come from the slave era, slavery era, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=339.36s)]
*  were part of the package that we issue [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=341.66s)]
*  to any sort of law enforcement [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=344.24s)]
*  or government sanctioned personnel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  Disturbing new video and images taken [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=348.24s)]
*  at the US-Mexico border that appear to show [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=350.72s)]
*  law enforcement officers on horseback [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=352.92s)]
*  using aggressive tactics to confront migrants. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=355.44s)]
*  What they're seeing is despicable, disgusting, cruel. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  Those are the words that I've been hearing from activists [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=362.16s)]
*  that I've been talking to. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=363.88s)]
*  As an image, to me it does smack of a bygone era [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=364.88s)]
*  of slavery. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=369.92s)]
*  To me, who's never read a book in my life, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=373.2s)]
*  it smacks of a bygone era. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=376.58s)]
*  It is slavery to ride a horse through a crowd of people [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=378.6s)]
*  trying to invade our country. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=381.32s)]
*  That guy went to Yale Law School, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=384.1s)]
*  in case you're wondering if the system is legitimate. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=386.32s)]
*  Answer, no. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=390.32s)]
*  Chris Cuomo really gets the credit he deserves [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=391.6s)]
*  for being the single dumbest person ever [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=393.2s)]
*  to perform on cable news. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=395.28s)]
*  He makes Don Lamont look like a particle physicist. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=396.24s)]
*  But the Biden administration is nothing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=398.96s)]
*  if not attentive to CNN. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=400.68s)]
*  They write the script. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=402.4s)]
*  So here's the DHS secretary once again, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=403.32s)]
*  accusing his own officers of quote, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=406.06s)]
*  weaponizing their horses. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=408.84s)]
*  One cannot weaponize a horse [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=411.91999999999996s)]
*  to aggressively attack a child. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=415.12s)]
*  That is unacceptable. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=417.32s)]
*  That is not what our policies and our training require. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=418.84s)]
*  Please understand, let me be quite clear. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=422.64s)]
*  That is not acceptable. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=426.44s)]
*  So there's one of the country's top law enforcement officers [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=429.24s)]
*  explaining to the former Morning Zoo girl [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  from AM radio in Yakima, Washington, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=435.4s)]
*  that he's offended by the idea of enforcing the law [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=438.2s)]
*  because laws are racist. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  But they're only racist when they're applied to foreigners [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=444.28s)]
*  who are likely to support the left's program. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=446.94s)]
*  So waiting under the bridge in Del Rio tonight [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=449.44s)]
*  is the Democratic party's future electoral majority. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=451.4s)]
*  That's what it really is. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's why they're protected. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=456.7s)]
*  So they can do whatever they want. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=458.12s)]
*  But how about you? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=460.35999999999996s)]
*  You're an American. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  You were born here. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=463.0s)]
*  You remember a free and egalitarian America, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=464.0s)]
*  a country where the same laws applied to everyone, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=467.28s)]
*  no matter what color they were. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  What about you? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=472.28s)]
*  Are you allowed this latitude? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=473.96s)]
*  No, you're merely in the way. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=475.23999999999995s)]
*  Keep your nose clean, Mr. American citizen. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=477.88s)]
*  Don your obedience mask, get your shot, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=480.2s)]
*  pay your taxes and shut up. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=482.52s)]
*  You are yesterday's constituency. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=484.56s)]
*  Nobody cares what you think. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=486.24s)]
*  That is the message. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMEClKXvWjo&t=487.82s)]
