# Biden is essentially a 'drunken airline pilot' and we're his passengers: Adam Carolla
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM)
*  Adam Kroll is an expert on the hilarious and terrifying. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=4.12s)]
*  Adam Kroll, thanks so much for coming out. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=5.04s)]
*  It does seem like the standards for leadership [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=7.08s)]
*  have been inverted, like the craziest person, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=9.52s)]
*  the least competent person, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=12.92s)]
*  the most obviously unqualified person [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=14.8s)]
*  becomes the leader of everybody else. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=17.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, think about this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=22.76s)]
*  Do a little thought experiment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  All the people you just mentioned [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=27.48s)]
*  and we'll throw in Biden, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=29.319999999999997s)]
*  we'll throw in Kamala Harris as well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  Would you hire them to coach [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=32.72s)]
*  your small town high school football team? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=36.0s)]
*  And if the answer is no, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=40.28s)]
*  if you like, you literally start laughing, right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=42.48s)]
*  If you said Feinstein or Fetterman [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=44.96s)]
*  or even Biden or Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=47.32s)]
*  any of these people, if you said, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=50.82s)]
*  I would like them to coach our high school football team, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  you would be laughed out of the small town [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=56.36s)]
*  that you lived in. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=59.52s)]
*  So if they cannot raise to that level, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=60.36s)]
*  then maybe they shouldn't be running the government. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=64.08s)]
*  But I think they're running the government [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=67.64s)]
*  because of their deficiencies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  So if you just took a cross section of 10,000 people [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=71.56s)]
*  from the phone book, assuming phone books still exist, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=74.4s)]
*  which they don't, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=76.28s)]
*  but it's a cross section of the population, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=77.12s)]
*  you would get some high aptitude people, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=78.54s)]
*  some low aptitude people. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=80.64s)]
*  This is not a representative sample. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=82.06s)]
*  Like the US Senate, for example, the White House, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=84.30000000000001s)]
*  it's disproportionately stupid and crazy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=86.48s)]
*  Like we're selecting bad people on purpose. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=89.28s)]
*  Well, it does dovetail nicely [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=94.5s)]
*  into the sort of intersectionality [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=97.28s)]
*  and all the woke stuff and all the affirmative action hires, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=99.92s)]
*  but could it go any other way? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=104.24s)]
*  I mean, if your criteria for hiring a football coach [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=107.6s)]
*  was we need the gayest, we need the darkest, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=111.88s)]
*  we need the ones who cross dress and transgender, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=114.88s)]
*  how would that football team's record be [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=118.44s)]
*  at the end of three years of playing? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=120.72s)]
*  I mean, how else could this go? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=123.08s)]
*  Well, maybe you've hit upon a solution [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=127.96s)]
*  to the current crisis in our former meritocracy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=130.2s)]
*  where Congress passes a law forcing the NBA and the NFL [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=133.24s)]
*  to abide by the same hiring standards [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  they're imposing on say JP Morgan and Citibank [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=140.6s)]
*  and everybody else. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=143.2s)]
*  Why not do that and we can all watch what happens [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=144.24s)]
*  when you abandon the meritocracy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=146.52s)]
*  Well, it would be the greatest experiment ever [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=150.66s)]
*  and I think it would be very informative [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=153.06s)]
*  to a lot of people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=157.44s)]
*  I think if you said we're gonna do a basketball team [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  that we're gonna hire by the same standards [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  that the federal government hires [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  in terms of intersectionality and race and everything else [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=166.56s)]
*  and then you watched a bunch of guys bounce the ball [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=169.84s)]
*  off of their foreheads and into the first row [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=172.8s)]
*  and score no points and each game would end [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  in a tie zero to zero, then maybe Americans [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  would take a look at the horrible sloppy play [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=181.84s)]
*  on the court and say, we don't want this in our government. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  The problem is we can't do the math. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=188.12s)]
*  We're not doing the math. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  The second Joe Biden said, I'm gonna run [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=192.86s)]
*  with a vice president who's female and black and other, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=197.08s)]
*  people should have been outraged by that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=199.84s)]
*  That's an insane statement. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=201.96s)]
*  It's a racist statement. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  It's an insulting statement to everyone who's in the country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=204.88s)]
*  I told you when I was on your show a couple of years ago, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=208.68s)]
*  I said, Joe Biden is essentially a drunken airline pilot [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=212.18s)]
*  and we're all in the passenger seats. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=216.36s)]
*  That's insane and it seems like an extreme analogy [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=219.4s)]
*  but is it that much different? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=223.12s)]
*  Well, it was actually foreshadowing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=226.28s)]
*  of what we're seeing in America's airports now [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  with the new near miss every week, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=229.64s)]
*  thanks to the equity hiring standards [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=231.11999999999998s)]
*  now being imposed on the airlines. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  So you called that early, Adam Carolla, appreciate it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=235.76s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks, Tucker. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9gOqOEQ4zM&t=240.44s)]
