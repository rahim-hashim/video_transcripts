# Tucker: This is happening all over the country
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 13, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=0.0s)]
*  If you've been paying attention for the past few years, and if you're watching this show, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=6.0s)]
*  we hope you are, there has likely been a moment when you realize that reality is not quite [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  what you thought it was. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=16.0s)]
*  A lot of the things you assumed were true, in fact, are not true. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=17.42s)]
*  They are instead a mirage. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=21.34s)]
*  They're a web of purpose-built myths designed to deceive rather than inform you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=22.34s)]
*  You can't really trust your senses anymore. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=28.52s)]
*  Your eyes will lie to you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=30.72s)]
*  That's an unnerving thought, especially when you realize that ultimately Vladimir Putin [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=33.28s)]
*  is behind it all. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=38.22s)]
*  Russian disinformation is everywhere in this country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=39.8s)]
*  It's lurking even within our own minds. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  It's worse even than Adam Schiff told us it was. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=45.0s)]
*  Just last weekend, for example, thousands of Southwest Airlines flights failed to leave [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=48.68s)]
*  the ground. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=52.6s)]
*  It seemed obvious that the mass cancellations were a direct reaction to Joe Biden's vaccine [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=53.84s)]
*  mandates. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=58.44s)]
*  They were announced just days before. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=59.36s)]
*  And then actual Southwest pilots appeared to confirm this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=61.04s)]
*  But no, that's just what the Kremlin wants you to think. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  In fact, as the authorities assured us all along, it was only the weather. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=69.32s)]
*  Nothing more than a few clouds. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=73.96s)]
*  Calm down, America. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=75.68s)]
*  That Southwest Airlines story is as fake as Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=77.4s)]
*  Don't let the Russians lie to you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=80.6s)]
*  People love the vaccine mandates, even the thousands who've been fired because of them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=82.88s)]
*  They know perfectly well how naughty they've been. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=87.68s)]
*  They need discipline and they're grateful to get it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  May I have another? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  There is a reason, in other words, that Joe Biden is the single most popular head of state [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  in American history. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=99.2s)]
*  And the reason is he's awesome. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  How beloved is Joe Biden? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=102.9s)]
*  Well, let's put it this way. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  At sporting events across the country, fans are breaking out in cheers for the White House [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  and its wise and eloquent leader. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=111.12s)]
*  These are not coordinated political set pieces, astroturf as we say in Washington. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=113.58s)]
*  No, these are spontaneous eruptions of love. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=118.58s)]
*  One minute you'll be watching a college football game from the stands. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=122.86s)]
*  The next minute you'll be overcome with the desire, the pressing, irresistible need to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  tell Joe Biden how great he is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=131.14s)]
*  It's like having to go to the bathroom real bad, except better and more progressive. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=133.78s)]
*  This is happening, ladies and gentlemen, and it's happening everywhere. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=138.36s)]
*  A cresting tsunami of support for Joe Biden. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=141.74s)]
*  Here's a sample. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=144.78s)]
*  It's inspiring when you think about it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=169.78s)]
*  Joe Biden on his first day in office promised to bring this country together and now he's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=171.62s)]
*  actually doing it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=175.58s)]
*  It doesn't matter what team you showed up to root for. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=177.08s)]
*  In your heart, you are a Joe Biden fan, and that is national unity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=180.18s)]
*  Now, not everyone is for this, of course, to Vladimir Putin, who hates us for our freedoms [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=183.82s)]
*  and also because he's Russian. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=189.62s)]
*  This is a threat. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  Loving Biden is a thing of beauty. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  So by definition, Vladimir Putin must destroy it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=194.38s)]
*  It's like a sunset, a rose garden, a baby's smile. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  It's something lovely that must be defiled if Russia is going to dominate the world. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=200.98s)]
*  So in order to corrupt what is good and beautiful, Putin has spread the lie that these expressions [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=205.54s)]
*  of pure devotion to Joe Biden are instead attacks on Joe Biden, vulgar attacks that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  include an epithet beginning with F. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=215.98s)]
*  And sadly, a lot of people believe that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=218.54s)]
*  Russian disinformation is effective. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  That's why they do it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  So thank heaven NBC has been there to correct that misperception. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  Over the past several years, NBC has done maybe more than any other news organization [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=228.42s)]
*  in this country to fight the Kremlin's propaganda machine. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=231.94s)]
*  Thanks to NBC, for example, your doubts about the fairness of the last election have not [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=235.42s)]
*  only been settled, they're now illegal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=240.1s)]
*  You're not allowed to express them ever again. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  So we can be thankful that there was a credentialed representative of NBC Sports on hand earlier [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=245.7s)]
*  this month when fans at a NASCAR event began to celebrate, spontaneously celebrate Joe [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=251.0s)]
*  Biden. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=256.18s)]
*  If the NBC lady had not been there, you might very well have misheard what the crowd said. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=257.7s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=263.3s)]
*  Oh my god, which is such an unbelievable moment. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=264.3s)]
*  Brandon, you also told me I can hear the chants from the crowd. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=267.86s)]
*  Let's go, Brandon. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  F Joe Biden? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=279.46s)]
*  Please come on. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=280.46s)]
*  Wake up America. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=282.46s)]
*  That's like looking at the thriving, incredibly robust economy all around us and concluding [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=284.05999999999995s)]
*  there's inflation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=288.82s)]
*  Settle down, Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  What they said, and you could hear it very clearly if you just open your ears to the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=292.9s)]
*  truth, is let's go, Brandon. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  The NBC lady made that very clear. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  Not F Joe Biden. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=302.26s)]
*  Let's go, Brandon. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=304.05999999999995s)]
*  But who is Brandon, you ask? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=305.82s)]
*  Well, just another happy American who is grateful for the wise leadership of his benevolent [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=307.29999999999995s)]
*  president. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=311.26s)]
*  In fact, Brandon is a newly arrived American, part of what we call the Biden generation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=312.26s)]
*  He's an undocumented trans-Haitian migrant now enrolled thanks to a Pell Grant as a film [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  studies major at NYU, as well as a part-time non-binary rights activist and puppeteer. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  Brandon is the embodiment of the new American dream, where everything's free but everyone [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=328.18s)]
*  is still angry. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=332.78s)]
*  Just this month, thanks to Joe Biden, Brandon got his fourth COVID shot. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=334.46s)]
*  That means he's an incredibly good person, far better than you are. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=339.3s)]
*  And the crowd is simply celebrating that, as grateful people spontaneously do. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=342.54s)]
*  Let's go, Brandon. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=346.42s)]
*  Let's get a fifth shot. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=347.54s)]
*  Let's go, Brandon. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=348.66s)]
*  So once you strip away the Russian propaganda, it's all pretty obvious and natural. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  But it does make you wonder, if you pause for a moment, if the Russians are lying about [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=356.54s)]
*  Brandon, what else are they lying about? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=361.18s)]
*  And we're glad you asked. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=364.14s)]
*  They're lying about hospitals. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=365.14s)]
*  Edward Putin is making up stories about our hospitals here in the United States. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=366.5s)]
*  Putin claims that our health care system is collapsing because of Joe Biden's vaccine [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=370.06s)]
*  mandates and that's preposterous. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=374.26s)]
*  And yet somehow, those crafty and relentless Kremlin propagandists have managed to get [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=376.9s)]
*  that story onto American television. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=381.62s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=384.14s)]
*  Hospital officials say they still plan to pause service in the maternity unit starting [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=386.3s)]
*  Saturday. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=390.58s)]
*  You know, we've had 43 resignations. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=391.58s)]
*  70% of those are in clinical areas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=395.26s)]
*  And unfortunately, a number of the maternity nurses, you know, the professionals who do [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=399.14s)]
*  labor, delivery and postpartum care are part of that group. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=407.9s)]
*  So the maternity nurses all left. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=413.46s)]
*  There'll be no more delivering babies in that hospital. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=415.3s)]
*  Now, the Russians blame Joe Biden for this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=418.5s)]
*  But the truth is very different. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=422.58s)]
*  The truth is that this is yet another heartfelt tribute to Joe Biden. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=424.26s)]
*  Those nurses left so they can devote more time to campaigning for Joe Biden's reelection [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=429.21999999999997s)]

*  Once again, this is an act of love disguised by a foreign power as an act of contempt. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  That's happening in a lot of places, ladies and gentlemen, not just New York. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=442.78s)]
*  Central Maine Medical Center is one of the biggest hospitals in the state of Maine. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=446.53999999999996s)]

*  Why? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=559.28s)]
*  You guessed it, Joe Biden's vaccine mandates. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=560.28s)]
*  Here's how one local news station reported it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=563.12s)]
*  Already short staff, the Seattle Police Department is preparing for a potential mass firing of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=566.68s)]
*  officers. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  Starting October 13th, the agency will move into what's called a stage three mobilization. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=572.56s)]
*  What the department's manual says is reserved for scenarios that have the, quote, potential [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=577.92s)]
*  to cause significant harm, property destruction, or widespread public fear. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=582.5799999999999s)]
*  154 sworn personnel had not submitted proof of vaccination as of Tuesday. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=588.36s)]
*  That number dropped to 292 today. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=594.72s)]
*  But still, that's more than 25% of all deployable officers. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=598.0s)]
*  So we've just given you a snapshot of what's happening in the country, but it's happening [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=604.28s)]
*  all around the country, from coast to coast and all through the middle of the country. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=608.04s)]
*  And it's happening right now. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=612.32s)]
*  And that means in the coming months, at some point, you're going to call 911 for an emergency. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=614.4s)]
*  Or you're going to show up at the hospital with an injury. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=618.52s)]
*  Or you're going to try to catch an airplane flight. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  And you will notice that you can't. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=622.8s)]
*  Because the hospitals, the police departments, the fire departments, your airlines, none [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=625.04s)]
*  of them work anymore. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=629.72s)]
*  Now Joe Biden is going to take the blame for this. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=631.52s)]
*  If the Russians have their way, Vladimir Putin will tell you, it's Joe Biden's fault. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=634.5s)]
*  Oh no, no. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX2FOHrreDU&t=638.88s)]
