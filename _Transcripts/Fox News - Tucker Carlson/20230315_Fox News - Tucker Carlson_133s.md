# Border Patrol chief makes bombshell admission at hearing
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js)
*  So among the many lies, it's hard even to keep track of all the lies, but Joe Biden's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=0.0s)]
*  DHS secretary has told us repeatedly the border is completely secure. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=4.38s)]
*  But now the chief of the border patrol just contradicted that in the starkest possible [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=9.88s)]
*  terms for that story. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=13.88s)]
*  Fox's Trace Gallagher joins us now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Hey Trace. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=17.04s)]
*  Hey Tucker. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=18.04s)]
*  He could not have been more clear if he stood on top of the Paso del Norte bridge in El [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=19.04s)]
*  Paso and yelled, liar, liar. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=23.28s)]
*  It is a quadruple blow to the Biden administration because border patrol chief Raul Ardila, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=25.04s)]
*  Chief Ortiz defied DHS secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and president Biden by saying this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=30.0s)]
*  Does DHS have operational control of our entire border? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=36.84s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=41.52s)]
*  You heard the secretary. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=44.0s)]
*  He said we have operational control. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=45.0s)]
*  That's the definition of operational control. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=47.36s)]
*  Based upon the definition you have sir, up there, no. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=48.36s)]
*  We don't have operational control. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=51.24s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  And there was more. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=54.36s)]
*  Chief Ortiz also said the border is not secure. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=55.36s)]
*  He defended horseback agents who president Biden accused of whipping Haitian migrants [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=57.94s)]
*  and then he offered a final spike in the heart by simultaneously coming after this administration [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  and supporting the previous administration saying it was a mistake to stop building the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=67.9s)]
*  wall, Trump's wall. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=73.17999999999999s)]
*  Chief Ortiz also pleaded for Congress to give him more border agents and asked for the tools [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=75.1s)]
*  to deliver consequences. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=79.5s)]
*  That's important, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=81.46s)]
*  Because for 26 months millions of migrants have crossed the border and received zero [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=83.3s)]
*  consequences. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  The chief told lawmakers this fiscal year alone 385,000 illegal immigrants have evaded [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  border patrol. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=95.41999999999999s)]
*  Those are people that border agents tried to catch but didn't, you know, the gotaways. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=96.82s)]
*  And an additional 79,000 snuck into the country completely undetected. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=101.22s)]
*  The final blow might be the chief's language where contrary to secretary Mayorkas, Ortiz [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=107.1s)]
*  referred to the border situation as a quote crisis. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=112.66s)]
*  Much more on this tonight on Fox News at Night, Tucker. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=116.74s)]
*  Chris Gallagher, thanks so much for that story. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=120.38s)]
*  You bet. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyr0Zs357js&t=122.1s)]
