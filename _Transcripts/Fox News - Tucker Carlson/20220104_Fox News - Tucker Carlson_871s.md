# Tucker: Why is this happening?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, one of the weirdest features of modern life [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=2.44s)]
*  has gotta be how we've all been trained [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=5.36s)]
*  to ignore the things that really matter. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=7.22s)]
*  You might have wondered, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=9.78s)]
*  just to pick one among so many examples, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  why hundreds of thousands of your fellow Americans [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=12.96s)]
*  seem to be living in squalor on the sidewalk. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  How'd that happen? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=18.78s)]
*  These are the so-called homeless. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=20.22s)]
*  Drugs have destroyed their lives. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=21.66s)]
*  So where'd those drugs come from, exactly? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=23.72s)]
*  And why is no one asking? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=26.44s)]
*  And speaking of chemicals, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=28.64s)]
*  men in America seem very different [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=30.0s)]
*  from what they used to be. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=31.8s)]
*  Anyone over 40 knows this, the changes are dramatic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=33.08s)]
*  You can't help but notice. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=35.88s)]
*  Could those changes have something to do [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  with the unprecedented drop in testosterone levels [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=39.42s)]
*  that scientists have measured repeatedly? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  And by the way, if that's happening, why is it happening? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=44.6s)]
*  And so on, there's so many questions like this, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  but we rarely talk about any of them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=49.8s)]
*  Instead, we're told repeatedly to avert our gaze [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=51.88s)]
*  from the obvious and turn instead [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=54.5s)]
*  to CNN's latest fixation, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=56.66s)]
*  whether it's a Chinese flu virus or George Floyd [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  or some forgettable border dispute in Eastern Ukraine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=61.779999999999994s)]
*  These are the issues they tell us we must care about, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=65.62s)]
*  but they're wrong. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=68.86s)]
*  These are not the most important issues. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=69.74s)]
*  They're just news stories. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=71.89999999999999s)]
*  The only remarkable thing about them [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=73.5s)]
*  is our willingness to believe they're more important [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=75.02s)]
*  than, say, Americans living outdoors on the sidewalk [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=77.3s)]
*  or whether or not our own children get married. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=80.3s)]
*  There's something a little scary about watching this happen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=83.82s)]
*  It's like an entire population transfixed [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=86.26s)]
*  by issues that ultimately don't really matter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  How's that gonna work out? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=91.9s)]
*  Well, over time, probably not very well. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=93.26s)]
*  Reality always reasserts itself. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=95.78s)]
*  Twitter can ban all the thought criminals it wants, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=98.58000000000001s)]
*  but in the end, Twitter is not in charge of the future. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=101.12s)]
*  Nature is in charge of the future. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  If you want your country to continue, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  you have to answer nature's imperatives, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  which are the basics. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=111.12s)]
*  Do you have enough water? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=112.34s)]
*  Do you have a reliable food supply? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=113.9s)]
*  Can you defend yourself from invaders? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=116.02s)]
*  What are you using for energy? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=118.7s)]
*  How are you producing things and keeping warm? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=120.5s)]
*  Those are the essential questions [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=123.52s)]
*  that any civilization must ask, those and one other. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=124.94s)]
*  How many people do you want living in your country? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=128.46s)]
*  The size of your population matters very much. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=132.3s)]
*  The size determines a nation's character. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=134.74s)]
*  It often determines its fate. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=136.9s)]
*  Yet we don't talk much about the size of our population. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=138.82s)]
*  We probably should. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=141.54s)]
*  The United States is growing faster [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=143.06s)]
*  than most Americans understand. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=144.48s)]
*  If you were born in 1969, as some of us were, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  you arrived in a country [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=149.16s)]
*  with a little over 200 million people in it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  There are now 334 million people in it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=152.88s)]
*  That's an awful lot of new people in an awfully short time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=156.88s)]
*  How many people is that exactly? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=160.32s)]
*  Well, it's nearly twice the population [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=162.04s)]
*  of the entire Western United States. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=164.28s)]
*  That's 13 states, including California. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=166.44s)]
*  That is massive and incredibly rapid demographic growth. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  And it's accelerating. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=173.04s)]
*  Immigration is now at the highest level [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=174.16s)]
*  ever recorded in American history. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=175.76s)]
*  So is the number of foreign born already living here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=177.74s)]
*  Over just the last year, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=180.68s)]
*  roughly 2 million people from the third world [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=182.04s)]
*  came across our borders illegally. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=184.28s)]
*  All of them arrived with the blessing of the White House. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=186.52s)]
*  It makes you wonder what sort of economy [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=189.36s)]
*  Joe Biden imagines we're gonna have going forward. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=191.32s)]
*  Domestic manufacturing is in steep decline. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=194.58s)]
*  Automation is replacing many of the low skilled jobs [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=197.04s)]
*  that still remain. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=199.5s)]
*  So what are these millions of new people [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=200.96s)]
*  gonna be doing for work 20 years from now? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=203.0s)]
*  They can't all be Nancy Pelosi's housekeepers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=205.62s)]
*  They can't all bust tables at the French laundry in Napa. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=208.44s)]
*  And not all of them will, thank God. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=212.0s)]
*  In spite of the Democratic Party's best efforts [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  to import a permanent surf class to serve its donors, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=216.8s)]
*  some of these immigrants will rise higher [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=219.68s)]
*  than Nancy Pelosi expects they will. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=221.38s)]
*  Some will fight their way to the top of our society [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=223.44s)]
*  with the usual combination of inborn talent and grit. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=225.8s)]
*  And honestly, bless them for that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=229.44s)]
*  No one invited them here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=231.28s)]
*  We didn't want them to come, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=232.3s)]
*  but we will be sincerely glad when they succeed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=233.92s)]
*  And yet, a country is more than the success [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=237.5s)]
*  of a handful of people, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=240.96s)]
*  inspiring as that always is to watch. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=242.16s)]
*  Sheer numbers matter too. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=244.5s)]
*  Even if every single person who snuck across [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=246.96s)]
*  our southern border this year [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=249.52s)]
*  goes on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=250.68s)]
*  it would still be worth worrying about the effects [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=252.92s)]
*  that mass immigration have on our total population numbers. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=255.64s)]
*  So the question is, how many people is too many? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=259.48s)]
*  In Washington, you will never hear that question. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=262.74s)]
*  More bodies in a country mean more power [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=265.42s)]
*  for the people who run it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=267.78s)]
*  Big nations need big governments. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=269.32s)]
*  Politicians always want more people to rule. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=271.4s)]
*  So the incentive for unrestrained population growth [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=274.14s)]
*  is baked right into the system. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=276.88s)]
*  That's bad news for the rest of us. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=279.0s)]
*  First and most obviously, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=281.22s)]
*  big governments don't treat their citizens very well. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=282.38s)]
*  Yes, that's a Reagan-era talking point. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=284.72s)]
*  It's also true. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=286.68s)]
*  The larger a bureaucracy becomes, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=288.26s)]
*  the more impersonal it gets. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  Past a certain size, organizations of any kind [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=292.02s)]
*  lose their regard for people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=294.58s)]
*  As they get bigger, they get blunter, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  more soulless and cruel. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=298.34s)]
*  The people in charge no longer care what you think. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=300.24s)]
*  They don't have to worry about how their policies [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=302.74s)]
*  will affect you or your family. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=304.74s)]

*  If you had five children, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=309.74s)]
*  you would bathe them all in love and attention. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=310.86s)]
*  If you had 5,000 children, you wouldn't know their names. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  So in case you're wondering why our leaders [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=316.76s)]
*  no longer seem especially interested in your health [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=318.56s)]
*  or happiness or prosperity, that's the reason. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=320.96s)]
*  They don't have to be interested. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  Our population's too big. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=324.64s)]
*  Why should your opinion matter? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=326.08s)]
*  You're one of many. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=327.8s)]
*  Previous generations of Americans [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=330.56s)]
*  didn't live in a country like this, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=332.02s)]
*  and they would be stunned by the attitudes [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=333.56s)]
*  that are so common now, attitudes we take for granted. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=335.76s)]
*  Arresting people for walking through [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=338.62s)]
*  the U.S. Capitol building? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=340.5s)]
*  How is that a crime? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=341.88s)]
*  19th century Americans would wonder. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=343.32s)]
*  For most of our history, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=346.04s)]
*  Americans believed they owned the Capitol. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=347.0s)]
*  They thought it was theirs [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  because they assumed this was their country. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=350.66s)]
*  Political leaders told them that it was. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=353.44s)]
*  After the 1904 presidential election, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=356.12s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt greeted voters in person [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  on the lawn of the White House. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=360.6s)]
*  It was his home. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=362.6s)]
*  He lived there, but it belonged to them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=363.44s)]
*  Attitudes like that are long gone. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  They're the victim of population growth. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=368.76s)]
*  The Athenians invented democratic government, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  but at its peak, Athens only had about 8,000 voters. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=374.34s)]
*  So past a certain scale, democracy can't function very well. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  The concept of the citizen becomes too abstract. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  You see it in the way our leaders talk. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=385.61999999999995s)]
*  Politicians barely mention individuals anymore. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=388.06s)]
*  Instead, they yammer on about voting blocks, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  which are now called communities, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=393.53999999999996s)]
*  the immigrant community, the trans community, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=395.52s)]
*  the Latino community, the black community. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=397.78s)]
*  You hear these terms constantly, but they are nonsensical. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=401.02s)]
*  They don't mean anything. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=403.78s)]
*  For example, there are about 47 million black people [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  That's a community? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=410.02s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=411.34s)]
*  By definition, 47 million people cannot be a community, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=412.61999999999995s)]
*  no matter what color the people within it are. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=416.55999999999995s)]
*  How could it be a community? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=419.2s)]
*  They don't even know each other. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=420.17999999999995s)]
*  What you're looking at is not a community, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=421.97999999999996s)]
*  but 47 million individuals, each created by God as unique, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=423.85999999999996s)]
*  each with opinions and interests and preference and goals [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=428.94s)]
*  that aren't quite the same as anybody else's. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=432.06s)]
*  In other words, they're human beings. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=433.82s)]
*  People who run big countries tend to forget that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=436.46s)]
*  When you're in charge of hundreds of millions of people, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=439.41999999999996s)]
*  you cannot help but to dehumanize them. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=441.5s)]
*  Not that our leaders have ever had a problem [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  with dehumanizing people. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=445.82s)]
*  In fact, they're strongly for it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=446.74s)]
*  A year and a half ago, some idiot kid from Harvard [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=448.58s)]
*  wrote a book demanding that the United States [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=450.85999999999996s)]
*  open its borders to an additional 700 million new immigrants [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=452.65999999999997s)]
*  from around the world. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=456.74s)]
*  If we did that, he argued in the book, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=458.38s)]
*  we'd have a population of a billion people [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=460.94s)]
*  and that might raise our GDP. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=463.53999999999996s)]
*  Wall Street would be thrilled. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=465.78s)]
*  Also, of course, we'd be more diverse [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  with more interesting restaurants. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=469.58s)]
*  Want Sierra Leone and goat barbecue [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=471.5s)]
*  delivered to your pod at 3 a.m.? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=473.62s)]
*  With a billion people living here, you could get that done. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=475.82s)]
*  As noted, the kid's a moron. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=479.34s)]
*  But in Washington, here's the interesting part. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=480.97999999999996s)]
*  No one laughed at him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=482.9s)]
*  Quite a few ostensibly smart people agreed with his thesis, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=484.58s)]
*  including some prominent Republicans [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=487.34s)]
*  who turned out to be as dumb and reckless as he is. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=489.21999999999997s)]
*  Apparently, none of them has ever spent time [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=492.29999999999995s)]
*  in a crowded country. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=493.78s)]
*  Anyone who has knows how deranged it is [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=495.9s)]
*  to want a billion people here in the United States. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=498.29999999999995s)]
*  Mass population growth makes life worse [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=501.34s)]
*  for pretty much everybody. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  That's the main problem with crowded countries. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=506.14s)]
*  They're hard to live in. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=508.09999999999997s)]
*  They're loud and dirty and chaotic. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  There is no privacy. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=512.54s)]
*  There is no open space. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=513.5s)]
*  There are never enough resources to go around, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=515.0999999999999s)]
*  so the culture tends to become hypercompetitive and clannish. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=517.5799999999999s)]
*  Crowding is bad for people. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=521.38s)]
*  It's anti-human. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=523.2199999999999s)]
*  In a famous series of experiments in the late 1940s, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=524.8599999999999s)]
*  a researcher called John Calhoun [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=527.4599999999999s)]
*  forced a group of Norway rats [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=529.6199999999999s)]
*  to live in highly overcrowded pens. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=531.5799999999999s)]
*  And almost immediately, the rats changed. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=534.2199999999999s)]
*  They became aggressive. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=536.14s)]
*  Then they became psychotic. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=537.3s)]
*  Ultimately, they died. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=538.9399999999999s)]
*  People aren't so different from that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=541.02s)]
*  They need room. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=542.6199999999999s)]
*  That's why our ancestors came to America in the first place [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=544.02s)]
*  because there was room here. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=546.5s)]
*  You know who still understands this? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=548.74s)]
*  Rich people understand this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=550.34s)]
*  Ask anyone who's been around the world [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=552.46s)]
*  and knows what the options are. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=554.1s)]
*  Ask, if you left the United States, where would you move? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=555.18s)]
*  And no one's gonna tell you Lagos [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=558.78s)]
*  or Mexico City or even Singapore. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=561.02s)]
*  If they're being honest, they'll tell you New Zealand [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=563.18s)]
*  or Alpine Switzerland. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=565.38s)]
*  Those are low density places. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=567.1s)]
*  They don't have a lot of other people in them. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=569.02s)]
*  Why did billionaires buy huge boats? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=571.42s)]
*  Same reason. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=573.14s)]
*  The ocean isn't crowded. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=574.18s)]

*  Really, only in a moment like this one, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=586.42s)]
*  when the people with the loudest megaphone [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=588.46s)]
*  speak exclusively in lies, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=589.9399999999999s)]

*  You're not imagining that. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=605.42s)]
*  It's real. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=607.06s)]

*  That's a terrible idea, obviously. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=624.62s)]
*  But it's not the core problem. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=626.3399999999999s)]
*  The core problem is that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=627.74s)]
*  bigness is inherently ugly. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=629.62s)]
*  There's never been a beautiful skyscraper. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=632.5s)]
*  Every single one of them is an atrocity. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=634.62s)]
*  The fact that people still pretend otherwise [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=637.78s)]
*  tells you how conditioned we have become [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=639.54s)]
*  to disregard our own nature and our own natural longings. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=642.3s)]
*  Would you rather wake up in a $30 million condo [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=646.0600000000001s)]
*  on the top floor of an office tower [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=648.58s)]

*  wood stove glowing as the snow falls? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=653.42s)]
*  That's a rhetorical question, obviously. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=655.82s)]
*  No sane person would choose the condo. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=657.2199999999999s)]
*  And yet we're told the condo is better. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=660.14s)]
*  That's why it costs more, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=662.38s)]
*  because the building is bigger. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=663.8599999999999s)]
*  But how exactly is its scale an advantage? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=667.8599999999999s)]
*  How is that appealing? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=670.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's not. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=671.78s)]
*  In fact, its scale is the problem. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=672.62s)]
*  Massive size is a threat, no matter what it is, always. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=675.38s)]
*  In our bones, we understand this. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=680.5s)]
*  Anything huge is inherently terrifying to us. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=682.74s)]
*  Children run from big things. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=685.62s)]
*  If there's an upside to the last two years [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=689.14s)]
*  of the COVID insanity, and there may be, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=690.94s)]
*  it's that many Americans seem to be remembering [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=693.22s)]
*  what they long for. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=695.34s)]
*  Look where they're moving. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=696.66s)]
*  Almost always it's to someplace smaller. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=697.9s)]
*  LA to Austin, New York to Burlington, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=699.94s)]
*  Seattle to Boise, Chicago to Naples. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=702.3s)]
*  So it's the reverse of any other internal migration [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=705.02s)]
*  we've ever seen. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=707.46s)]

*  or at least to the outer suburbs. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=711.46s)]
*  They want more nature, more human contact, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=713.42s)]
*  more trees, more quiet. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=715.34s)]
*  And it's hard to believe they'll ever stop wanting [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=717.4200000000001s)]
*  these things, because they're natural. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=719.14s)]

*  finished settler town on the banks of Lake Superior [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=733.1800000000001s)]

*  People aren't that stupid. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=743.5s)]
*  They've just been misled. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=745.1s)]
*  Economic forces are gonna drive this, by the way, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=747.5400000000001s)]
*  as they always do. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=749.5s)]
*  For decades, our leaders have ignored the essentials. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=750.9s)]
*  Our food, our energy, our water, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=754.5400000000001s)]

*  Pregnant flight suits, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=759.14s)]
*  These people are ridiculous, and we're about to see [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=761.74s)]
*  the results of their longstanding negligence. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=764.14s)]
*  Energy prices, for example, probably aren't going down. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=766.9s)]
*  How high are they gonna go? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=769.74s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=770.58s)]
*  But at some point, it will become very obvious [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=771.82s)]
*  that it makes more sense to buy your staples maybe nearby. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=773.98s)]
*  More sense than it does to order them online [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=777.02s)]
*  from a warehouse across the continent. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=778.9s)]
*  So the rising cost of transportation [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=783.22s)]
*  is likely to be permanent. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=785.9s)]
*  The world we live in, in other words, cannot last. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=787.58s)]
*  And that's not necessarily a tragedy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=790.4200000000001s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with setting down routes [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=792.3000000000001s)]
*  somewhere that's smaller. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=794.54s)]

*  It's pretty nice, actually. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=800.78s)]

*  believe it or not. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=804.82s)]
*  Healthy societies are not at all like the one we are living in now. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=806.26s)]
*  They're not impersonal. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=809.7s)]
*  They don't exist to maintain empires. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=811.06s)]
*  They exist to serve the human beings who live within them. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=813.42s)]
*  They elevate their citizens. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=816.86s)]
*  They don't degrade them. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=818.54s)]
*  Now, obviously, that's the opposite of the system we currently have. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=820.14s)]
*  The good news is the system we currently have cannot last. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=823.26s)]
*  It's too perverse. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=826.86s)]
*  It's too disconnected from the natural world. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=827.74s)]
*  So it will end. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=830.3s)]
*  And as it does end, as we think about how we want to live going forward, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=832.18s)]
*  it's worth remembering that other people, in the end, are all that matters. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=835.34s)]
*  Your relationships are the sum of your life. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=839.66s)]
*  Those relationships start with your family. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=842.6999999999999s)]
*  They move outward in concentric circles. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=844.18s)]
*  They include your friends, your neighbours, and the people you work beside. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=845.86s)]
*  This is your actual community. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=849.62s)]
*  The human beings you know personally, the ones you love, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=851.98s)]
*  the ones you take responsibility for. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ka7zKnzEfs&t=854.74s)]
