# Citizens have 'right' to defend themselves: Staten Island Borough president
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I)
*  Jose Alba came to the country from the Dominican Republic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=0.0s)]
*  and 30 years later, he was doing what he came to do, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=2.96s)]
*  which is working. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  He's 61 years old, and yet Friday night a week ago, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=6.4s)]
*  at midnight, he was working in a convenience store [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=8.9s)]
*  in Harlem when a violent criminal walked in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=11.36s)]
*  in a dispute over a bag of potato chips [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=14.64s)]
*  his girlfriend was trying to walk off with, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=16.44s)]
*  assaulted the much older Alba, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=18.52s)]
*  threw him to the ground, grabbed him by the neck. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Ultimately, Alba stabbed the guy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=23.56s)]
*  Clear self-defense. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=25.52s)]
*  The video's online. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=26.84s)]
*  If you haven't seen it, you should watch. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=27.68s)]
*  It's very upsetting. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=28.72s)]
*  So then the thug's girlfriend shows up [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=30.52s)]
*  and starts stabbing Alba. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=33.74s)]
*  Not in self-defense, out of rage, which is not allowed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=36.18s)]
*  But the Soros-backed DA in New York, Alvin Bragg, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=39.72s)]
*  charged Alba with murder, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=43.22s)]
*  but did not charge the girlfriend who stabbed Alba. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=44.84s)]
*  So after public outcry, Alba's bail was lowered, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=49.0s)]
*  but he's still in home confinement. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  He's still facing murder charges. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=53.32s)]
*  The video that we just got from the New York Post [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=55.44s)]
*  makes it very clear that Alba did everything he could [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=57.92s)]
*  to avoid a confrontation with this criminal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=62.32s)]
*  I don't want a problem with you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=73.04s)]
*  The guy threw the old man down, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=74.88s)]
*  then grabbed him by the neck. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=76.36s)]
*  Now he's facing murder charges. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=77.88s)]
*  Vena Fissela has served in Congress. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=79.48s)]
*  He's now the borough president of Staten Island, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  probably the best borough. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=83.6s)]
*  He's spoken out in defense of Alba. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=84.68s)]
*  Vena Fissela, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=86.88s)]
*  This, are we missing details? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=89.24s)]
*  This seems like an incredibly straightforward example [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=92.12s)]
*  of self-defense by a virtuous guy against a thug. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  You know, this is wrong on so many levels. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  Those who know the trend in New York City [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=102.58s)]
*  know that crime was on the rise. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=104.6s)]
*  Bodegas, which this guy worked at, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=106.46s)]
*  robbed almost once a day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=109.64s)]
*  They're in very confined spaces. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  They're vulnerable. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=113.22s)]
*  They tend to be in very often low-income areas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=114.06s)]
*  And we also know that violent criminals have been let go. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=117.42s)]
*  They get arrested and they're back on the street. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  And then along comes this poor guy, just earning a living, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=123.14s)]
*  is threatened, assaulted, trying to defend himself. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=126.86s)]
*  And if there's anything real and right in this country, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=131.54s)]
*  it's the right to defend yourself or your property. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=134.06s)]
*  And rather than arrest the woman who stabbed him, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  this poor guy is facing 15 to 25 years in jail. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=139.94s)]
*  So what we did just a few days ago in Staten Island, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=143.38000000000002s)]
*  some folks may not know, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=146.36s)]
*  New York City is comprised of five boroughs, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  five different counties. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=149.56s)]
*  Each borough has its own district attorney. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=150.8s)]
*  What we said on Staten Island is that if you get attacked, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=153.28s)]
*  if you're assaulted, you have the right to defend yourself. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=156.18s)]
*  And while they may put you in jail in Manhattan, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=158.68s)]
*  Staten Island, you'll get a medal. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=160.9s)]
*  And for some reason, we have this alternative universe [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=162.46s)]
*  that's being created where the victim has become the criminal [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=165.24s)]
*  and the criminal has become the victim. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=167.66000000000003s)]
*  And what we wanna say is let's get our city back, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=169.36s)]
*  let this guy go and let's get the violent criminals [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=171.73999999999998s)]
*  off the streets. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=174.42s)]
*  That's our message. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=175.33999999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's pretty obvious [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  that members of politically favored groups [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=177.7s)]
*  are just not gonna be punished no matter what. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  And this Albo is not a member of that group, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=181.38s)]
*  so he is being punished. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=184.14s)]
*  But how can you not, if you're the DA, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=186.06s)]
*  how can you not charge the girlfriend [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=188.82s)]
*  who also stabbed somebody and can't even claim self-defense? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  That's totally revealing, I think. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  It seems to be just absurd to insane. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=196.54s)]
*  And anybody with a half an ounce of common sense [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=200.3s)]
*  looking at this video has to feel for this guy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=203.18s)]
*  And as I said, rather than charge the people [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=206.54s)]
*  who initiated this, threatened him, assaulted him, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=208.9s)]
*  are now looking to put him behind bars for up to 25 years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=212.14s)]
*  Something's gotta give. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=215.58s)]
*  NASA is releasing its Webb Telescope today or tomorrow. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=216.9s)]
*  They're gonna release images of New York City. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=221.38s)]
*  It's a foreign land. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=223.34s)]
*  In so many pockets of this community, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=224.62s)]
*  it's a great city, it's a vibrant city, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=226.98s)]
*  but too often we've ceded the streets over to the criminals. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=229.14s)]
*  Yeah, it wouldn't be hard to fix it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=232.9s)]
*  Just do the obvious. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=234.34s)]
*  Reward good behavior, punish bad behavior. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=235.7s)]
*  It's not hard. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=237.82s)]
*  Vena Fisela. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=238.66s)]
*  I appreciate your bravery, Ernest. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=239.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=240.4s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTRkxqL8h7I&t=242.45999999999998s)]
