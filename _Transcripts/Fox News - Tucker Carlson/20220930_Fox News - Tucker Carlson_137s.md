# Would Ukraine joining NATO start World War III?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80)
*  Let's ask Colonel Doug McGregor, a retired U.S. Army Colonel, and he joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=0.0s)]
*  Colonel, great to see you this evening. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Just a whirlwind, whiplash of news today when it comes to Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=7.28s)]
*  What should we make of it? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=12.48s)]
*  Well, not quite what Senator Graham had to say, or for that matter, President Biden. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=14.56s)]
*  The destruction of the pipeline was clearly not executed by Russia. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  No one believes that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=26.38s)]
*  In fact, the German population is being polled and overwhelmingly is opposed to the notion [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=28.08s)]
*  of any war with Russia and dismisses out of hand the notion that the Russians are responsible [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  for the pipeline. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=37.72s)]
*  I think three things are what we're dealing with right now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=38.72s)]
*  First of all, Putin has decided that no one in Washington will negotiate with him, and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=42.08s)]
*  he knows that Washington is ultimately in control. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=47.36s)]
*  And so he's decided that in response, he's got to escalate the military operation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=50.4s)]
*  People aren't aware of it in the West, but the Russian forces in Ukraine have always [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=55.36s)]
*  been outnumbered from the day they entered Ukraine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=58.88s)]
*  That's going to change rather dramatically, and I suspect the bombers that she referred [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  to, who carry both conventional or nuclear weapons, will have conventional arms, and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=65.78s)]
*  those bombers are probably going to be used in the escalation that we're about to witness [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=71.44s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=75.24s)]
*  And I think he's going to settle this dispute in Ukraine on terms that are acceptable to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=76.24s)]
*  Russia that we may not like. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=81.98s)]
*  But other than Poland, no one in NATO is interested in going to war with Russia. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=84.2s)]
*  If we persist on this line, we will see NATO dissolve and fragment. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=89.16s)]
*  Because they will assume you're saying they will not follow Poland's lead, not stand [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  together. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=100.84s)]
*  I assume that's what you're saying, Colonel? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=101.84s)]
*  Of course, absolutely. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  No one wants to go to war with Russia other than the Poles and a few people in Washington, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  D.C. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=111.92s)]
*  Well, that will be the key. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=113.4s)]
*  That will be the key, whether or not, if the world will not follow the Poland into war [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=114.4s)]
*  with Russia, will in fact the leaders of the United States of America push the world into [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=118.04s)]
*  war with Russia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=121.88s)]
*  Colonel Doug McGregor, always great to hear from you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=123.48s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fparWYY80&t=125.4s)]
