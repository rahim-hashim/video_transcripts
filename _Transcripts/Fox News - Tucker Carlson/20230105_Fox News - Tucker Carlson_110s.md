# Tucker accurately predicts Adam Kinzinger's fate
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g)
*  Sort of amazing news to report tonight, not really a Fox News alert, but very close. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=0.0s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger leaves Congress and then someone hires him. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=5.88s)]
*  Someone literally hired Adam Kinzinger for a job. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=10.4s)]
*  You may not believe it, but Trace Gallagher of Fox News can confirm it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  He was watching another channel tonight when he learned. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=17.2s)]
*  Trace Gallagher, what did you see? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, after seeing its ratings plummet over the past two years, Tucker, CNN has informed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=21.2s)]
*  longer be a far left media organization and will instead go back to being an unbiased [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=26.44s)]
*  news source, as if there was evidence that CNN was ever an unbiased news source. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  But to prove that things are changing, CNN has now hired former GOP Congressman Adam [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=36.88s)]
*  Kinzinger as not just a political analyst, mind you, but the network's senior political [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=41.72s)]
*  analyst, which is no surprise to this show, which just days ago predicted this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=47.2s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=53.36s)]
*  In the next few weeks, Adam Kinzinger will be another CNN contributor. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=54.36s)]
*  No one will ever see him again, but we will never forget him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=57.48s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=62.12s)]
*  And it appears to be a good fit considering the only one who hates former President Trump [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=63.24s)]
*  more than CNN is Adam Kinzinger. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=66.84s)]
*  Remember it was Kinzinger who voted to impeach Trump. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=69.76s)]
*  Kinzinger, who was a member of the January 6th committee, said if Trump was not charged [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=72.36s)]
*  with inciting an insurrection, the future of the country is doomed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=76.84s)]
*  And Kinzinger, who called Trump's GOP, quote, kind of creepy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=81.2s)]
*  Got to be looking forward to the promos, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Kinzinger and CNN, the dynamic unbiased duo. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=87.84s)]
*  Providing some senior political analysis. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=93.4s)]
*  Trace Gallagher, the best. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fTDm7gQO9g&t=95.60000000000001s)]
