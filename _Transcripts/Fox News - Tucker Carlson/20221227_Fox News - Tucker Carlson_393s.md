# Libs of TikTok founder reveals her identity to Tucker
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ)
*  Revealing your identity right now. Why are you doing that and why haven't you before? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=0.0s)]
*  so [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=4.24s)]
*  The reality is that I think most Twitter accounts are anonymous [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=5.76s)]
*  Yes, start with unless you're a public official or you know a figure of unless you have the verification [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=9.76s)]
*  Well, not anymore. Yeah, right that but until Elon changed that, you know, most most Twitter accounts start off anonymous as did mine [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=16.28s)]
*  and then I [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=25.48s)]
*  You know when my account started growing I [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=28.36s)]
*  realized the hatred [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=31.6s)]
*  That the left has and their violent nature and I was like I'm going to remain anonymous [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=34.24s)]
*  Yes, as my account was growing and getting more effective [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=40.68s)]
*  And I have remains anonymous until now. Well until I was I was stalked. My name was shared [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  My location was shared. My my photo is never shared that I've never done any in-person [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  events and I'm choosing to do that now because I [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=57.12s)]
*  Feel like I over the past few months [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=62.6s)]
*  I've done so much. I've helped educate people. I know that I have helped create legislation [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=65.88s)]
*  to tackle some of these issues and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=73.72s)]
*  I think I've done all I can and I am ready for the next step. I get people [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Asking me I have mom groups asking me all the time. Can you come help us? I [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Got in invitations, you know to help to help people understand [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  How do you how to expose the left and how to fight it and you know being anonymous was sort of keeping me [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  Really? I was restrained from from doing all those things and I am ready to do that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  I think that I'll be a lot more effective when I'm not so anonymous anymore [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=107.28s)]
*  And I'm excited. I already have a couple of speaking engagements planned for the next few months [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  And you know, hopefully there will be more but I want to do all I can [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=119.32s)]
*  and and help people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=123.88s)]
*  To fight this agenda and I'm glad that you are I think it's an act of bravery [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=126.28s)]
*  And you've had a remarkable effect and I just want to say and I'll say this another ten times because I think it's the most [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Interesting part about you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  You haven't really editorialized very much what you've done [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=137.32s)]
*  Essentially is bring to light bring to further light to publicize what they're already saying in public. That's your crime [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=141.4s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. They don't they don't want it to be shown though to certain audiences [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=147.56s)]
*  They they want their their content out there, but but they don't want us to see it. So it doesn't really add up [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=151.68s)]
*  No, it doesn't add up and they have no valid complaint against you, right? You haven't violated anyone's privacy [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=159.12s)]
*  You're posting what they put on tick-tock. They're allowed to post it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=165.0s)]
*  But we're just not let I notice the crime is noticing what they're doing. Yes, that's always the crime. Yeah [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=168.6s)]
*  so I think you've done an amazing thing and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=174.4s)]
*  Unlike so many other people in journalism and I am gonna whether you like it or not describe you as being in journalism [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=176.96s)]
*  Because I think you are I think I am too [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  You've had an effect a real effect by bringing this to light. How did you wind up? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=184.48s)]
*  I mean to the extent you're comfortable sharing it. Like how did you wind up doing this? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=189.58s)]
*  I assume you went to Columbia Journalism School to become a journalist. I went to Harvard and Yale [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=193.18s)]
*  I [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=197.68s)]
*  Thank God I didn't know because those are now obviously those institutions are all poisoned [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=200.6s)]
*  But so it started really during kovat [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=206.96s)]
*  I was noticing all of this content that was being published on tik-tok [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=209.6s)]
*  And I was just like this is crazy [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  But what at this point you're not in a related field like you weren't no [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=220.12s)]
*  You're not doing anything related to public policy or journalism nothing related to politics journalism now [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=225.96s)]
*  Maybe were you very political? No [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=231.88s)]
*  Really? I was not this kovat was like the other day. This is a couple years ago. Yeah, this was two years ago [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=235.04s)]
*  Well, my account started two years ago. Yeah [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=239.72s)]
*  That's that was just incredible. You can have this effect this quickly. So you're not a super political person [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=243.04s)]
*  You're not watching people's speeches on c-span [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=248.48s)]
*  No, there's a normal person stuck inside exactly and then and then kovat happened and and I think that kovat [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=251.2s)]
*  For me and I think for a lot of people it really woke people up [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  And it was sort of it was like an awakening [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=264.8s)]
*  either you can [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=267.44s)]
*  stay [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=269.2s)]
*  Like sleeping, you know [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  Not really interested in what's going on in our government or you can choose to get it to get involved [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=272.08s)]
*  And I think kovat really drew a lot of people in just because of all of the insanity that was going on and that was being [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  Imposed on us our rights were being violated [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  and I was like and that was really [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  That was really a turning point for me [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=291.96s)]
*  to to get involved in and to be interested and then [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=294.32s)]
*  Kovat also is when tik-tok started becoming big [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  Because everyone was stuck at home looking for entertainment and then they stumbled on tik-tok and we started seeing all those videos of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=302.64s)]
*  nurses, you know dancing in hospitals during [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=311.12s)]
*  During the pandemic and I was like, you know, tik-tok was was getting really big and I was like, oh, you know [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=314.12s)]
*  Let me let me see what this tik-tok thing is all about and then I stumbled upon this whole [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=319.52s)]
*  This whole platform with with all of I mean all of the stuff, you know [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=327.08s)]
*  Everyone I'm sure has seen some of the videos [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  It's just there's so much more and I was like I just I need to disseminate this like this it's just so bizarre and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=333.36s)]
*  And dangerous and I was like I just need them as many people to see this as possible [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=341.68s)]
*  And in in large part not exclusively but there was a lot of adults bragging about sexualizing children [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=347.04s)]
*  Yes a lot [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=354.12s)]
*  specifically teachers [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  There are also just parents activists doctors [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  That is the most scary part about it. And that's what my account focuses on a lot now [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=362.88s)]
*  Gosh what an interesting conversation [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=370.08s)]
*  I hope her stepping out inspires others to do this to do the same step out and speak the truth [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2SUWUXV8TQ&t=372.36s)]
