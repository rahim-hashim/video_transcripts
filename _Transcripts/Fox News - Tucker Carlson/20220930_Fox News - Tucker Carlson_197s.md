# These women are unbelievable: Dana White
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374)
*  When Dana White first got involved in the UFC back in 2001, he said he never imagined that the sport would allow female fights. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=0.0s)]
*  That all changed in 2013 when Dana White met Ronda Rousey, who went on to become one of the most famous female combat sports athletes in the world. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  So when you got into this 22 years ago, did you imagine there would be a category for female fighters? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  No. What you have to understand is at that time, I was trying to get people to accept men fighting in a cage, which people thought was horrible. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=25.04s)]
*  I saw a fight up in Northern California with two women. That was a horrible mismatch. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=34.8s)]
*  And I was like, oh, my God, nobody's ready for this. Then I met Ronda Rousey. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=42.08s)]
*  And it was ugly. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=48.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was ugly. I mean, you know, you see a woman on her back taking elbows to the face that she can't defend and that she's not she shouldn't even have been in this fight. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=49.4s)]
*  It's rough to see, you know, you know, again, I grew up in it and it comes off chauvinistic sometime, you know, because I know we live in a day and age where, you know, women want to be equal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=60.72s)]
*  And believe me when I tell you women have proved here that they are equal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=71.52s)]
*  One of the greatest fights that you will ever see in your life is Waley Zhang versus Yohana Yonjacheck. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=77.36s)]
*  And I don't mean female fights. One of the greatest fights you'll ever see is that fight. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=83.72s)]
*  So they have absolutely proven themselves. And people love the women's fights. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=88.6s)]
*  And they're so technical and they're so good. It's just I didn't see it coming. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=93.84s)]
*  And I didn't see it happening that fast. And women getting even women who were boxing back in the day, it was like a novelty. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=98.44s)]
*  They had no defense. So they'd stand in front of each other and just, you know, flail away and, you know, people would go crazy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=104.76s)]
*  But nobody was like, wow, that woman is super talented. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  She's, you know, you know, her style of fighting or this or that here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=114.04s)]
*  These women are unbelievable. They're very technical and very good. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  And you know, from the numbers that the audience responds. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=124.48s)]
*  No, the audience doesn't respond. The audience loves it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=128.36s)]
*  When I put a real good woman's fight on the card, a lot of people show up for that fight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=130.8s)]
*  They're there. When you ask them, you know, what's one of the highlights of tonight? Why are you here? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=135.32000000000002s)]
*  I want to see Waley Zhang and Yohana Yonjacheck. I want to see, you know, Amanda Nunes versus Juliana Pena. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=139.4s)]
*  I want to see Rhonda Rousey. These women become have become big stars. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=145.4s)]
*  Yeah. Famous. Yeah. It's awesome. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=150.0s)]
*  And what's different from us than any other. These women are as equal as the men. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=153.44s)]
*  They fight the same amount of rounds in non-title fights. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=159.0s)]
*  They fight the same amount of rounds in championship fights. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=162.52s)]
*  They get paid exactly the same as the men do. You know, they don't hit from a shorter tee. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=165.84s)]
*  They don't have, you know, all these other little handicaps they have for women when they play in other sports. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=170.44s)]
*  It's absolutely equal here for women and men. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=175.4s)]
*  The meritocracy at work. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=179.0s)]
*  And it's not a ring that I or Tucker, I think, ever want to be in. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=182.52s)]
*  Catch our nightly opens. Stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpP6e_K374&t=189.0s)]
