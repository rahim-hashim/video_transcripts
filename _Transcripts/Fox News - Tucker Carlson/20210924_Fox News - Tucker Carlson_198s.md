# Tucker blasts Biden for attacking the weak
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw)
*  So you've been hearing all week from the usual hysterical liars that the Border Patrol somehow [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=0.0s)]
*  officers used a whip to beat immigrants at the southern border just searching for a better [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=5.2s)]
*  life trying to get refugee status. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=10.4s)]
*  Everything about that is a complete lie. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=12.46s)]
*  A lot of the Haitians that are southern border in Del Rio already had refugee status in other [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=14.56s)]
*  countries that don't offer free healthcare so they came here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  By the way, the Border Patrol doesn't have whips. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=20.84s)]
*  They don't whip anybody. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=22.84s)]
*  They ride horses and horses have reins. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=24.72s)]
*  Today the photographer who shot that picture of the alleged whips were on the record to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=27.52s)]
*  confirm that the officers were using reins and they weren't whipping anybody. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=31.36s)]
*  So that should be the end of the story but of course it suits the Biden administration's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=36.08s)]
*  political purposes which is rushing as many new people into the country as possible so they can [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=40.8s)]
*  win the next several election cycles so they're continuing to lie. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=46.08s)]
*  The Biden administration has banned the Border Patrol from using horses [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  and today Joe Biden who has a fetish for going after the weak we notice [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=55.44s)]
*  vowed to crush the hourly workers who were involved in this, the Border Patrol officers. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=66.56s)]
*  To see people treated like they did, horses really running them over people being strapped, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=67.76s)]
*  it's outrageous. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=73.36s)]
*  I promise you those people will pay. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=74.4s)]
*  They will be an investigation underway now and there will be consequences. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  There will be consequences. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=81.52s)]
*  It's an embarrassment. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=83.28s)]
*  Can you imagine talking like that? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=86.16s)]
*  Those Border Patrol officers didn't bring their own horses to beat immigrants for fun. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=88.16s)]
*  They were riding horses owned by Joe Biden's government. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=93.44s)]
*  They were doing what they were told to do which is enforce federal law passed by the United States [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=97.52s)]
*  Congress and then the President of the United States, these are some of the weakest people [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=101.76s)]
*  by the way in our country. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=105.6s)]
*  They're just Border Patrol agents. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=106.56s)]
*  They have no power. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=108.48s)]
*  Imagine being married to one of these guys or being the child of one of these guys and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=110.24s)]
*  seeing the President of the United States say we're going to crush these people because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=113.76s)]
*  they're evil and implying they're racist. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=116.64s)]
*  It's sick. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=119.44s)]
*  So the DHS secretary and Kamala Harris today both claimed the officers had used whips, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=121.68s)]
*  liars. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=127.12s)]
*  They said the non-existent whips prove that systemic racism is real. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=128.0s)]
*  The investigation into what occurred has not yet concluded. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=132.8s)]
*  We know that those images painfully conjured up the worst elements of our nation's ongoing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=137.6s)]
*  battle against systemic racism. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=143.92s)]
*  And there needs to be consequence and accountability. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Human beings should not be treated that way and as we all know it also evoked images [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  of some of the worst moments of our history where that kind of behavior has been used against [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  the indigenous people of our country, has been used against African Americans during [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  times of slavery. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  This is someone who went to high school and is not even from here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=171.12s)]
*  She's from Canada. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=173.44s)]
*  How did the best country in the world get the worst people in the world to run it? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  It'd be interesting to know that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=180.4s)]
*  We can't control it at this point. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=182.56s)]
*  All we can do is assess what they're doing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwlWFJHA2Tw&t=183.68s)]
