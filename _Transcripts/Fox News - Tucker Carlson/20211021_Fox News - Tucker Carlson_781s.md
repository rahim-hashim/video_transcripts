# Tucker: What the hell is going on here?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=0.0s)]
*  cheerful in spite of it all. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=4.72s)]
*  We have spent an awful lot of time telling you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=5.76s)]
*  what we think about the Biden administration. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=7.36s)]
*  We do it virtually every night, a little repetitive. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=9.36s)]
*  So tonight for once, we're going to let [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration speak for itself. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=15.08s)]
*  This show has obtained some recently shot footage [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=18.56s)]
*  of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the president [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=21.32s)]
*  and vice president of the United States, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=23.64s)]
*  or vice versa, depending on your view. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Footage that shows them in their private moments, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=27.72s)]
*  deep within the federal compound in Washington. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  It is a remarkable window into who these people really are. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=33.16s)]
*  And maybe the most remarkable thing about it [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=36.44s)]
*  is that this video comes from the Biden administration [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  itself. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=41.16s)]
*  They released it, apparently on purpose. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=42.28s)]
*  They wanted you to see it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=44.42s)]
*  They thought you would be impressed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=46.44s)]
*  They thought it would make them look good. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=48.2s)]
*  Keep that in mind as you watch this first clip. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=51.04s)]
*  This footage is from Kamala Harris's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=54.0s)]
*  surprise birthday party the other day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Surprise. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=60.56s)]
*  Surprise. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Happy birthday to you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=62.24s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=64.48s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=66.16s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=66.98s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=68.66s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=69.48s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Yes, America, you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=71.14s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=72.26s)]
*  Woo. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=73.08000000000001s)]
*  Happy birthday to you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=74.4s)]
*  Happy birthday to you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=78.54s)]
*  Happy birthday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=82.7s)]
*  Happy birthday to you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=85.02s)]
*  In the entire history of sad parties, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=95.46s)]
*  that has got to take first place. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=98.74s)]
*  Talk about a mirth-free event. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=100.32s)]
*  It's like a room full of aliens [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=102.34s)]
*  have gathered to act out this concept [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=104.32s)]
*  they've just heard about called happiness. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  The head alien is a supernaturally strange being [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=108.86s)]
*  called Kamala Harris, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=111.78s)]
*  who for reasons no one ever explains, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=114.02s)]
*  walks into a room in the most secure building in the world [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  with a piece of elasticized fabric over her face. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  Like that's totally normal. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=122.14s)]
*  Just another masked birthday celebration. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=123.5s)]
*  This Kamala Harris then walks over to a man [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  press reports claim is her husband, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=129.94s)]
*  who like her is fully vaxxed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=131.98s)]
*  He for some reason has a mask on his face too, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=133.98s)]
*  which suggests that they don't actually live together [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=137.28s)]
*  or indeed have ever met. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=139.5s)]
*  We don't know the truth, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=141.42s)]
*  but whatever it is, the two then proceed to pantomime [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=142.26s)]
*  the most sexless imitation of a kiss imaginable, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  awkwardly rubbing faces through the gauze. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=148.34s)]
*  And then as if it could get weirder, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=151.04s)]
*  Harris suddenly yells surprise [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=154.1s)]
*  at her own surprise birthday party. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Like she's hosting the event [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=158.78s)]
*  for one of her multiple personalities. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=160.06s)]
*  What the hell is going on here? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  Who are these people? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=164.54s)]
*  Oh, just our leaders, the people who run the country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  And then it gets truly bizarre. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=167.78s)]
*  Take a look at this video. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=170.34s)]
*  Again, intentionally released [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=171.52s)]
*  by the White House press office of Joe Biden in a hallway. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=173.44s)]
*  He totters along like a nursing home patient [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=177.56s)]
*  in the final stretch, clearly unaware of his surroundings [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=179.88s)]
*  or what he's carrying in his own hands. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  Spoiler alert, they're flowers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=184.66000000000003s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=187.74s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=188.58s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=190.26000000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=191.08s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  Oh, Joe. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=194.44s)]
*  Oh, I'm very sorry. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=195.26000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=199.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=201.4s)]
*  Oh, look at that, Gord. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=202.24s)]
*  This is my favorite. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  Got it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=209.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=210.52s)]
*  Oh, I'm gonna hang this up with great pride. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=211.34s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=213.72s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=215.12s)]
*  The camera catches her masked alone in her own office. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  And then she talks. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=222.36s)]
*  Oh, Joe, I'm very touched, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=223.24s)]
*  says this alien posing as vice president. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=225.4s)]
*  She goes on to use the word gorgeous, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=227.8s)]
*  a word that no actual human being has used since 1977. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  There's even if you listen for it, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=234.0s)]
*  a fake kiss sound in there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=236.0s)]
*  We're assuming Harris made that sound, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  though it's possible they're playing some sort of soundtrack [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=240.0s)]
*  in the background. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=242.12s)]
*  Lifelike party sounds, volume one. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=243.16s)]
*  We can't be certain. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=245.6s)]
*  What we do know is that they wanted you to see this, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  and that is interesting. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=249.16s)]
*  You can tell a lot about a regime [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=250.88s)]
*  by the propaganda it produces. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=252.28s)]
*  North Korea puts out a ton of propaganda. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=253.94s)]
*  Just the other day, Kim's government released a video [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  of its soldiers breaking concrete slabs [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=258.04s)]
*  with their bare hands. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=260.12s)]
*  One particularly committed communist lies down shirtless [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=261.88s)]
*  on shards of broken glass. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=265.12s)]
*  So the message here is not hard to understand. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  These are the people defending North Korea. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=269.76000000000005s)]
*  Back off or we'll eat you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=271.92s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=274.46000000000004s)]
*  But what's the message of the Joe and Kamala videos? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=276.48s)]

*  The people in charge are even worse [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=281.92s)]
*  than you thought they were? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  Kamala may have seemed kind of fake to you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=284.72s)]
*  Joe may have looked a little out of it, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=286.3s)]
*  but actually the White House is now telling us [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=287.64s)]
*  you don't know the half of it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  It's possible Kamala Harris is an actual robot [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=292.2s)]
*  with batteries, the new frontier of AI. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=294.76s)]
*  Joe Biden isn't just punchy, he's barely conscious. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=298.2s)]
*  That's the message they're sending. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=302.2s)]
*  It's really strange, and it's been going on for a while. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=304.3s)]
*  Remember last year when Joe Biden read from a note card [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=308.24s)]
*  that Kamala Harris would be his vice president? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  This was the announcement video they released. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=313.0s)]
*  Hi, hi, hi, sorry to keep you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=317.26s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=319.7s)]
*  You ready to go to work? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=321.14s)]
*  Oh my God, I'm so ready to go to work. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=324.38s)]
*  First of all, is the answer yes? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=326.9s)]
*  The answer is absolutely yes, Joe, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=328.94s)]
*  and I am ready to work. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=331.26s)]
*  I am ready to do this with you, for you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=332.82s)]
*  I just, I'm just deeply honored and I'm very excited. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=335.58s)]
*  Hey. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=340.58s)]
*  Whoa, that's just beyond belief. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=343.7s)]
*  So why would the people around Joe Biden [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=346.78s)]
*  want the public to see something like that? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=349.14s)]
*  Maybe they don't care. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=351.7s)]
*  Maybe they're not embarrassed of Joe Biden's condition. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=353.06s)]
*  Maybe in fact his condition was the whole point [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=355.18s)]
*  of making him the Democratic nominee for president [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=357.78s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=359.65999999999997s)]
*  That's not unimaginable, it's happened, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=361.38s)]
*  there's precedent for it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  In 1617, a group of unscrupulous political operatives [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=364.94s)]
*  in Istanbul installed a mentally defective man [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=368.46s)]
*  as Sultan of the entire Ottoman Empire. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=371.94s)]
*  His name was Mustafa I. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=374.46s)]
*  Historians later referred to him as Mustafa the Mad, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=376.46s)]
*  and he certainly was that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=379.06s)]
*  Mustafa spent his days babbling like an infant [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=380.82s)]
*  and throwing coins to birds. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  Occasionally, if he was feeling sporty, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=385.44s)]
*  he would knock the turban off someone else's head. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=387.38s)]
*  He was completely demented. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=389.78s)]
*  The general population didn't know that, of course. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  The Sultan rarely left the palace, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=393.62s)]
*  and when he did, he spoke from a script. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=395.02s)]
*  But the people around him certainly knew. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=397.42s)]
*  They preferred him that way. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=399.62s)]
*  He was easier to control. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=401.14000000000004s)]
*  Whenever you think of him, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=403.42s)]
*  Joe Biden is definitely easy to control. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=404.26s)]
*  You recall this clip in which Biden kept referring [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=406.94s)]
*  to something called the Harris-Biden administration. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=408.94s)]
*  Harris-Biden administration is gonna relaunch that effort [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=413.06s)]
*  and keep pushing further to make it easier [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=415.54s)]
*  for military spouses and veterans [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=417.3s)]
*  to find meaningful careers. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=419.14s)]
*  Again, these are prepared remarks. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=423.02000000000004s)]
*  We can't say that enough. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  These are statements that the Biden people [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=425.98s)]
*  are making voluntarily. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  So many of them are like that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=429.70000000000005s)]
*  They're not gaffes. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=431.58000000000004s)]
*  They're what they want you to see. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=433.06s)]
*  In December of last year, Kamala Harris, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=435.64000000000004s)]
*  who grew up in Canada, a foreign country, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=437.26s)]
*  swore that she witnessed, quote, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=440.1s)]
*  multiple generations of her family celebrating Kwanzaa, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=441.54s)]
*  an American holiday that was invented [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=445.26s)]
*  in Long Beach, California, after Kamala Harris was born. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=447.18s)]
*  My sister and I, we grew up celebrating Kwanzaa. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=451.48s)]
*  Every year, our family, and our extended family, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=454.9s)]
*  we would gather around across multiple generations, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=458.29999999999995s)]
*  and we'd tell stories. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  The kids would sit on the carpet, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=463.32s)]
*  and the elders would sit in chairs. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=465.09999999999997s)]
*  So to everyone who was celebrating, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=467.06s)]
*  happy Kwanzaa from our family to yours. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=469.5s)]
*  Our family. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=474.46s)]
*  That's just crazy. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=476.78s)]
*  They would put something like that out. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=478.09999999999997s)]
*  Not one word is true, but not one word is believable. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=480.06s)]
*  Again, it was a prepared statement. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=483.66s)]
*  It was carefully considered. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=484.98s)]
*  They didn't even bother to look at a calendar. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=486.5s)]
*  It was like when Kamala Harris said [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=488.92s)]
*  that Tupac was the best rapper alive [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=490.18s)]
*  23 years after he died. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  When you're making history, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=495.48s)]
*  you don't care about chronology or facts. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=496.32000000000005s)]
*  We've never had a vice president [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  who looks like Kamala Harris, so words no longer matter. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=499.78000000000003s)]
*  That's the real message. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=502.06s)]
*  All that matters is what Kamala Harris looks like. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=503.82000000000005s)]
*  She's our Martin Luther King. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=506.26000000000005s)]
*  In 1965, the actual Martin Luther King [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=508.5s)]
*  told the story about a civil rights march [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=510.54s)]
*  in Birmingham, Alabama. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=512.08s)]
*  At that march, a police officer asked a young girl [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=514.14s)]
*  who was present, what do you want? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=516.42s)]
*  In King's telling, quote, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=518.9s)]
*  the little girl looked at him straight in the eye [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=520.18s)]
*  and answered, feed him. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=522.02s)]
*  That was 1965. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=524.74s)]
*  Here's Kamala Harris' version of the same story, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=526.54s)]
*  this time starring Martin Luther King's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=528.98s)]
*  modern reincarnation, Kamala Harris. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=530.74s)]
*  She would tell the story about how they're marching. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=534.38s)]
*  And this is back when strollers didn't really have armrests [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=536.9s)]
*  and seat belts. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=539.34s)]
*  So they're marching away and shouting and all of that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=540.9s)]
*  And then I think it was my Uncle Freddie looked down [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=546.54s)]
*  and then looked in the stroller, which was empty. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=550.3s)]
*  And said, where's Kamala? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=554.9s)]
*  And apparently, they left me like a block behind. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=558.2199999999999s)]
*  I'd fallen out the stroller. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=560.66s)]
*  There you go. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=565.3s)]
*  And then my mother would tell a funny story [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=566.14s)]
*  about how like one day she, and I was fussing [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=567.78s)]
*  and you know, and so I'm fussing and fussing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=570.5799999999999s)]
*  She, it's much cuter when she would tell the story, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=572.5799999999999s)]
*  but she'd say, so then she would look down at me [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=574.66s)]
*  and Kamala, what do you want? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=576.78s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=577.9399999999999s)]
*  And I looked back up at her and I said, freedom. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=578.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=581.54s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, that's our Martin Luther King, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=588.6999999999999s)]
*  the Canadian version, except without the wisdom, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=590.74s)]
*  the insight, the restraint or the eloquence, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=593.18s)]
*  but with a brand new, highly creepy engineered laugh. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=595.02s)]
*  A noise that according to zoologists, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=599.98s)]
*  scares the hell out of squirrels [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=601.62s)]
*  and other small woodland creatures. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=602.66s)]
*  But maybe you like it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=604.34s)]
*  Maybe you wanna hear a whole lot more terrifyingly cringy [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=605.78s)]
*  fake laughter from a highly ambitious lady with dead eyes. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  The White House is betting that you do. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=612.78s)]
*  So to accommodate your bottomless appetite [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=614.78s)]
*  for being patronized by Kamala Harris, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=616.86s)]
*  they released this video in which she talks about space. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=618.66s)]
*  I just love the idea of exploring the unknown. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=622.82s)]
*  And then there's other things that we just haven't figured out [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=627.22s)]
*  or discovered yet. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=629.86s)]
*  To think about so much that's out there [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=631.1s)]
*  that we still have to learn. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=633.82s)]
*  Like I love that. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=636.0200000000001s)]
*  I love that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=637.34s)]
*  And so I'm very excited about the space council. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=638.1800000000001s)]
*  You guys are gonna see, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=640.6600000000001s)]
*  you're gonna literally see the craters on the moon [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=642.5s)]
*  with your own eyes. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=645.74s)]
*  With your own eyes, I'm telling you, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=648.2600000000001s)]
*  it is gonna be unbelievable. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=650.9s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=654.02s)]
*  It's funny, you imagine often that the truth is hidden away. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=657.0600000000001s)]
*  We'll never really get to what the truth is. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=660.34s)]
*  But in fact, very often the truth is right there. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=662.98s)]
*  It's right in the video. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=664.74s)]
*  Just look at the video. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=665.58s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=666.74s)]
*  It's the truth they want you to see anyway. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=667.5600000000001s)]
*  And for that reason, it's deeply revealing. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=669.62s)]
*  That video tells you everything. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=671.42s)]
*  One of those kids, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=673.5s)]
*  listening to Kamala Harris talk about space, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=675.0600000000001s)]
*  we later learned, was a child actor. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=676.7s)]
*  And yet he was still the most genuine person in that video. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=678.74s)]
*  It's kind of nuts when you think about it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=683.5400000000001s)]
*  These people literally have no idea how absurd they look [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=685.6600000000001s)]
*  and how could they? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=689.3000000000001s)]
*  They live in a tiny, airless cult [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=690.1400000000001s)]
*  where everyone pretends that Joe Biden is fully competent [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=691.76s)]
*  and Kamala Harris is a civil rights hero. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=694.0600000000001s)]
*  It's Jonestown. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=696.1400000000001s)]
*  The clips we displayed are the documentary evidence [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=698.34s)]
*  that historians of the future will study [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=700.9000000000001s)]
*  to figure out what happened to America. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=702.22s)]
*  Behind the heavily guarded walls of the White House, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=705.1s)]
*  everyone has gone crazy. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=707.26s)]
*  Just this week, the Biden administration declared [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=710.22s)]
*  that a biological man who wears a dress [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=712.34s)]
*  is now a female admiral. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=714.78s)]
*  And then they sent that brave four-star female admiral [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=717.62s)]
*  out to deliver a speech that read like something [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=720.86s)]
*  out of a D-Day documentary. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=722.74s)]
*  Watch. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=723.9399999999999s)]
*  I am truly honored to join the ranks of men and women [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=724.9399999999999s)]
*  across this great nation who have committed [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=728.3s)]
*  to defend the United States against small and large threats, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=730.92s)]
*  known and unknown. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=734.62s)]
*  I am honored to serve as the first female four-star officer [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=737.06s)]
*  of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=741.26s)]
*  Come on. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=745.06s)]
*  They're daring you to sit there and not say [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=745.9s)]
*  this is ridiculous, but it is ridiculous. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=747.38s)]
*  Sorry, not playing along. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=749.86s)]
*  But they don't think it is. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=752.18s)]
*  And so you have to ask yourself, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=753.6999999999999s)]
*  how long will it be before Joe Biden appoints his horse [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=755.02s)]
*  to the Supreme Court? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=757.62s)]
*  And when he never really does do that, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=759.42s)]
*  you have to ask how long will it be [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=760.98s)]
*  till CNN informs us this is a watershed moment [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=762.3s)]
*  for equine rights. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=764.98s)]
*  Don't you dare laugh. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=766.36s)]
*  That would be a hit crime. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQv_h5JQJHY&t=767.28s)]
