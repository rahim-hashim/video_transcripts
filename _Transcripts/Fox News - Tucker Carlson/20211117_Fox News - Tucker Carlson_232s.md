# Truck driver claps back at MSNBC's Tiffany Cross
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 17, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc)
*  So we don't have enough truck drivers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=0.0s)]
*  That's part of the so-called supply chain problem. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=3.68s)]
*  Of course, the cause is we've acted like driving a truck was somehow a disreputable thing to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=6.08s)]
*  do, and majoring in gender studies was like the greatest thing you could do. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=11.32s)]
*  So we're obviously reaping the fruits of that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=14.36s)]
*  But MSNBC has a completely different explanation for it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=16.72s)]
*  You'll be shocked to learn that according to a host called Tiffany Cross, the real problem [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=19.8s)]
*  is racism. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=25.2s)]
*  According to Tiffany Cross, too many truck drivers are the wrong color. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=26.2s)]
*  This is, again, an industry populated by a lot of white men over the age of 55. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=29.92s)]
*  This group of people overwhelmingly voted for Trump. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=35.4s)]
*  Some people have talked about, you know, aggressive truck drivers cutting them off or not being [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=38.88s)]
*  helpful. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=43.52s)]
*  So if you think the supply chain problem is the result of racism, maybe you've got a certain [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=47.36s)]
*  obsession that's coloring your interpretation, so to speak. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=53.8s)]
*  All of this was kind of interesting news to Karl Tharp Porter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=58.56s)]
*  He's a truck driver called Karl from the South Side. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=61.6s)]
*  We saw his response to that segment on Twitter. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=64.2s)]
*  Here's what he wrote, quote, I'm a truck driver. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=66.08s)]
*  Doesn't matter that I'm black and I've never experienced racism from the drivers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=68.36s)]
*  Don't bring your leftist agenda to us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=71.28s)]
*  So we thought it'd be kind of interesting to talk to an actual truck driver, which Karl [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=74.0s)]
*  Tharp Porter is, and we're happy to have him join us right now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=76.84s)]
*  Karl, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=79.44s)]
*  So MSNBC's view is this is somehow a race crisis, our trucking shortage. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=82.76s)]
*  Is that your experience as a truck driver? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  I want to say that there is a divide, but it's not on the issues of race. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=95.28s)]
*  I had to do my due diligence as far as talking to the elder experienced truck drivers that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=101.28s)]
*  are so-called black, and I had to ask them, you know, have you experienced these things [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=108.56s)]
*  like is being interpreted? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=112.32s)]
*  And the obvious is that a lot of people are dealing with emotional issues here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=114.88s)]
*  It's more of an accountability issue. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  It's a spiritual battle. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  And I think that it's either right or wrong, good or evil. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=125.36s)]
*  And that's how I look at it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=128.92s)]
*  I like to look at things in that type of lens. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=130.12s)]
*  I don't fall into the prey of the left where it goes more of the emotional base and it [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=132.76s)]
*  emotional weariness as far as being fearful of things to happen. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=138.92s)]
*  What struck me was that the woman stated that there was a racism issue, but she didn't talk [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  about the more important issues like of gender being in the field of truck driving as a woman. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=149.56s)]
*  That we deal with wage issues. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=155.72s)]
*  We deal with DOT regulation issues. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=158.32s)]
*  The fact that I have to be over the road for over two weeks and then come back home and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  I see my family, those are true issues. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=164.48s)]
*  I don't want to deal with the invisible boogeyman like racism. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=166.36s)]
*  So to be able to talk about this, Tucker, I appreciate you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=170.44000000000003s)]
*  And I just want to get that word out that we need to get over this imaginary thought [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  of racism. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  To me it doesn't exist. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=180.52s)]
*  Again, it's only good and evil, right and wrong. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=181.72000000000003s)]
*  Truckers that do things that are wrong out there, you need to take accountability and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  let those people know that that's not the way that we do things. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=189.28000000000003s)]
*  We are a family unit in the truck driving industry. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  We don't want to deter young drivers like myself away from the industry because of other [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=194.44s)]
*  people's fears and disbeliefs. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=198.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=200.72s)]
*  So, in other words, the real problem with truck driving is it's a hard job. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=201.72s)]
*  You know, it's hard on your family when you get paid more. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=208.8s)]
*  Maybe they could point that out once in a while. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=209.8s)]
*  Yeah, I bet. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=212.24s)]
*  Well, thank you for doing it because we need it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=213.72s)]
*  Karl Thorpe Porter. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=215.64s)]
*  Good to see you tonight. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=216.64s)]
*  All right now, take care. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAP_cXtEDQc&t=218.64s)]
