# Will Cain: How bad can inflation get?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ)
*  Ned Ryan is the CEO of American Majority and he joins us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Ned, great to see you tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=4.16s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=5.74s)]
*  Thanks, Will. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=6.58s)]
*  Sadly, I think we have to ask the question [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=8.0s)]
*  that's probably at the top of everyone's mind. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=9.56s)]
*  It's bad, but how bad can it get? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=11.6s)]
*  Oh, I don't think we're anywhere near the bottom, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  sadly, Will. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=17.78s)]
*  When you hear Biden saying that his solution [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=19.12s)]
*  to solving inflation is more government spending, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=21.76s)]
*  more regulation, I mean, these will be jet fuel [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  on inflation and continue to tank the economy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=29.04s)]
*  And so when people hear these as the solutions, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=32.44s)]
*  that's why he's going down with Hispanics, independence. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=35.68s)]
*  I would also point out, Will, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=39.4s)]
*  that he's at 57% approval in the black community. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=41.0s)]
*  And to give people perspective, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=44.64s)]
*  right before Democrats got completely shellacked [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  in the 2010 midterms, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Obama was still over 90% with the black community. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  This thing is absolutely trending in the wrong direction. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=54.32s)]
*  And the thing that I wanna point out to people though [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=57.6s)]
*  is this, Will, these are not bugs. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=59.72s)]
*  These are features of the Biden administration, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=63.0s)]
*  the outrageous government spending, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=65.64s)]
*  the terrible energy policy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=67.76s)]
*  All of these things are absolutely intentional. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=69.28s)]
*  It's not as though they're gonna wake up someday and go, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  oh yeah, we made mistakes, we're gonna solve this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=74.04s)]
*  These are intentional and they're doing it in such a way [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=76.88s)]
*  to compel certain behavior. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=79.8s)]
*  When I hear people talk about $6 for a gallon of gas, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=81.16s)]
*  I know many on the left would prefer to have $10 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=84.6s)]
*  for a gallon of gas to compel people [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  to actually start using renewables [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=89.44s)]
*  to force that behavior on people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  And we're ruled by dangerous fools, Will. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  They do not care about the priorities of the American people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  They do not care about anything [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=98.88s)]
*  that will actually benefit the American people [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=100.6s)]
*  because quite frankly, in their arrogance, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=102.6s)]
*  they don't think the dirty little peasants [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  know what's best for them. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=106.44s)]
*  But Ned, you would think that they do care about winning. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  All of this they're putting in place [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=111.8s)]
*  and what you suggested is that it's a feature, not a bug, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=113.68s)]
*  would seem to get in the way of winning an election [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  in the midterms or in 2024. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=119.2s)]
*  Where is their sense of victory? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=121.4s)]
*  Where is their sense of a self-correcting mechanism, Ned? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=124.48s)]
*  I think they are so far gone. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=128.52s)]
*  I mean, they're stuck between a rock and a hard place, Will, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=130.44s)]
*  in which the far left has really taken over [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=133.16s)]
*  the Democratic Party and they really can't pivot out of this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=135.28s)]
*  And I think they're going to face some really harsh realities [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=138.60000000000002s)]
*  in this fall's midterms. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  I think Biden will be the 800-pound gorilla [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  with cement boots on Democrats [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=145.56s)]
*  at the federal, state and local level. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  And I think the interesting thing about this, Will, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=150.16s)]
*  because they are in denial, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=151.92s)]
*  I think that the devastating, absolute annihilation [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  they will face in 2022 will have long-term benefits [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=156.76s)]
*  for multiple election cycles, 2024 and beyond. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=160.0s)]
*  You remember that old Saturday Night Live skit, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  Ned, with Will Ferrell, where they play, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=165.16s)]
*  give me more cowbell? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=167.32s)]
*  It's got Christopher Walken in it as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  And it's, don't fear the reaper. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=170.2s)]
*  No matter what, he wants more cowbell. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=171.64s)]
*  My suspicion is that the answer to this [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=173.44s)]
*  will be more cowbell. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=175.56s)]
*  It will be more Democratic accusations [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=176.64s)]
*  of them being the savior from white supremacy [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=178.48s)]
*  and more accusations of their opponent as racists. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=180.56s)]
*  And let's see if that delivers them, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=182.88s)]
*  the American people who are suffering from this economy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=184.32s)]
*  More cowbell, Ned, we'll see. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=186.88s)]
*  I enjoyed talking to you tonight, Ned. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=190.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=191.0s)]
*  Thanks, Will. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=191.88s)]
*  You cannot get it anywhere else. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeafMvHUdOQ&t=201.6s)]
