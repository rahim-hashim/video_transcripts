# Prior: They ‘don’t have the right’ to impose gender transitions on parents
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00)
*  And it's happening all over the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=0.0s)]
*  Ian Pryor has been on this for a long time, more than a year. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=1.6600000000000001s)]
*  He's the executive director of Fight for Our Schools in Virginia, and we're happy to have [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=4.2s)]
*  him join us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=7.94s)]
*  Ian, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=8.94s)]
*  You wonder if parents in your state are aware of just how this hasn't gone away just the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  opposite. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  We've seen all these videos of angry parents at school board meetings, but they've gotten [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=16.78s)]
*  even more aggressive in pushing it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=19.72s)]
*  Or am I imagining that? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=21.42s)]
*  No, that's absolutely right. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=22.42s)]
*  And this bill that is being pushed in Virginia by Elizabeth Guzman, I mean, it's evil, but [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=24.3s)]
*  it's predictable. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=29.36s)]
*  I mean, this is where it goes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=30.36s)]
*  We've been dealing in Virginia, especially Northern Virginia, with schools that say, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=31.96s)]
*  well, look, if Judy comes to the school counselor and says, I want to be John now, we don't [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=35.92s)]
*  have to tell the parent unless the student gives us permission. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=40.7s)]
*  And the reason why they don't tell the parent is because the parent might not affirm that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=44.16s)]
*  And the schools consider that an unsafe environment, abusive. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=48.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=52.24s)]
*  And so that's why the parents don't get to know. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=53.24s)]
*  This is the natural progression. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  A law that says, yes, we agree it's abusive. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=57.14s)]
*  And since it's abusive, now we're going to send CPS after you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=60.14s)]
*  We're going to prosecute you for felonies and misdemeanors. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  And we're going to we're going to destroy your lives and destroy your employment. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=65.86s)]
*  And we're going to take your kids from you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=68.82s)]
*  What Elizabeth Guzman did was entirely predictable. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  And all the Democrats like Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton, that's they're going [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=73.88s)]
*  to try and distance themselves from this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=78.22s)]
*  You can't. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=80.14s)]
*  You've already gone out there and said you support schools keeping this information from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=81.14s)]
*  parents. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=85.7s)]
*  You're completely OK with this agenda and you're not going to be able to outrun it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=87.28s)]
*  But teachers and school administrators and Elizabeth Guzman from Peru, they're not your [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=92.28s)]
*  kids parents. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  You're your kids parents. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Where do they get the right to make these kinds of decisions for your children? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, they don't have the right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=104.08s)]
*  I mean, they do not have the right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=105.72s)]
*  The Constitution gives parents the rights to the care, custody and control of their [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=107.16s)]
*  children. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=111.0s)]
*  So if they tried this, they would be roundly defeated in court. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=112.0s)]
*  But look, the fact of the matter is for people like Elizabeth Guzman and her allies, if you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=115.06s)]
*  go and you're reading your kids books about transgenderism at five, you're getting them [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=119.3s)]
*  on puberty blockers, you're then giving them testosterone and getting a double mastectomy, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=123.86s)]
*  you're a great parent. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=128.34s)]
*  Otherwise, if you don't believe that, they're going to prosecute you, put you in jail, and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=129.7s)]
*  you're not going to see your kids because they're going to take them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=134.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=136.78s)]
*  Well, live and let live. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=137.78s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't mean it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=139.1s)]
*  Ian Pryor, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=140.1s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=141.9s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10FcTSmFe00&t=142.9s)]
