# Tucker: Adam Kinzinger... what a man can be when he stops trying to be a man
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we're going to have updates for you in a moment on the new FBI censorship scandal [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=1.92s)]
*  as well as the CIA's involvement in the Kennedy assassination 59 years ago, which is now confirmed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=6.72s)]
*  It's all real. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  But first, because it's Friday and we're in a sentimental mood, we'd like to take a moment [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=14.8s)]
*  to say goodbye to one of our all-time favorite members of Congress, Mr. Adam Kinzinger of Kankakee, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Illinois, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=23.84s)]
*  Kinzinger was first elected to the House 12 years ago, and for the bulk of his time in office, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=25.6s)]
*  he served utterly without distinction in virtual anonymity. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  A few of his constituents had heard of him, but none expressed interest in learning more. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=33.84s)]
*  Then, in 2018, came the transformation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=39.04s)]
*  That was the year that Adam Kinzinger turned 40 and things began to change inside of him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=42.0s)]
*  The first signs were subtle but unmistakable, choking up at a car insurance commercial, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  opening an Instagram account and posting pictures of himself, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=51.68s)]
*  wearing spandex bike shorts to Starbucks without shame and sometimes with a fanny pack. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=54.8s)]
*  By 2021, Kinzinger had a full-blown case of male menopause with all of familiar painful symptoms, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=60.32s)]
*  mood swings, hot flashes, food cravings, uncontrollable weeping. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=66.4s)]
*  A lesser man would have retreated from public life, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=71.52s)]
*  chosen new pronouns and transitioned in private. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=73.84s)]
*  But Adam Kinzinger chose another path. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=76.64s)]
*  He chose to be a role model. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=78.64s)]
*  He wanted other middle-aged men to know there is life after a hormonal imbalance. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=80.8s)]
*  And so on July 27, 2021, Adam Kinzinger bravely came out of the closet as a weepy man. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  You may remember the moment. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  I never expected a day to be quite as emotional for me as it has been. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  But you guys won. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=100.16s)]
*  You guys held. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=103.44s)]
*  You know, democracies are not defined by our bad days. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=104.16s)]
*  Imagine the courage that took. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I am emotionally incontinent. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I am utterly irrational. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=119.2s)]
*  No, I will not be silent. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=121.28s)]
*  In Washington, Kinzinger's performance was considered deeply inspirational. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=123.92s)]
*  Here's a man who has no control of himself at all, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=127.84s)]
*  so we'd better put him in charge of important things. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Kinzinger quickly became regarded as an essential voice on foreign policy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=132.56s)]
*  When the world hangs in the balance, you want a guy who cries a lot. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=136.56s)]
*  For his part, Kinzinger demonstrated a remarkable ability to make any situation on the planet, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=140.08s)]
*  no matter how complex or weighty, all about him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=144.56s)]
*  Here he was yesterday on the House floor in his final, yes, emotion-laden address. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=151.12s)]
*  History has proven that American isolation from the world affairs is dangerous. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=156.4s)]
*  Over the years, I've been privileged to lead the effort on supporting American leadership [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=162.72s)]
*  in a world drowning in faux strongmen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=166.48s)]
*  Advocating for the rights of Syrian men, women, and children [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  to live without fear of Assad's death squads shouldn't be political. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=173.76s)]
*  It's just simply the right thing to do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=178.24s)]
*  Advocating for stronger American assistance in Ukraine [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=181.28s)]
*  to counter Putin's illegal invasion shouldn't be political. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=184.88s)]
*  That's just the right thing to do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=188.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's just the right thing to do. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=191.44s)]
*  See, the world actually isn't complicated. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=192.88s)]
*  In fact, the world is simple. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=195.68s)]
*  It's like an original made-for-TV movie on Lifetime, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=196.88s)]
*  the kind where you burn through two bags of skinny pop just trying to keep your tears in check. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=200.0s)]
*  So if Adam Kinzinger is doing something in a foreign country with guns, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=204.72s)]
*  by definition, it's, quote, just the right thing to do. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  Like in Syria, Kinzinger's often expressed concern for Syria's men, women, and children [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=211.68s)]
*  is what matters. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=216.72s)]
*  And because that concern matters so much, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  Kinzinger has pushed hard to continue the Neocon proxy war in Syria. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  Result? Syria now has no economy left and there's a massive cholera outbreak in progress. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Men, women, and children are dying in huge numbers because it's just the right thing to do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  Same in Ukraine. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  Kinzinger made that clear the other day when he responded personally [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=235.12s)]
*  to a Twitter account called Cat Turd. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=238.4s)]
*  Because when you're one of Washington's leading authorities on foreign policy, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=240.96s)]
*  you spend a lot of time on Twitter reading accounts with names like Cat Turd. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  So the other day, Cat Turd made the mistake of posting a meme that seemed to mock the colors [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=247.36s)]
*  of the Ukrainian flag, colors that are sacred to Adam Kinzinger [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=251.44s)]
*  and every other empathetic soccer mom in her mid-40s. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=255.12s)]
*  You can imagine how offensive that was. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=258.0s)]
*  It was like telling an off-color joke about Meghan Markle. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=260.48s)]
*  It could not stand. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=263.36s)]
*  And so alone and battling debilitating hot flashes in his kitchen, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=265.68s)]
*  fighting the urge to open yet another bag of chips ahoy, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=268.8s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger fought back. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=271.44s)]
*  Literal evil, he wrote in a late night response to Cat Turd. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=273.44s)]
*  If I met you in person, it would not end well for you, sicko. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=278.32s)]
*  Hear that, Cat Turd? It will not end well for you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=285.12s)]
*  That's not a pillow fight Adam Kinzinger is talking about. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=289.04s)]
*  That's a full-on slap fight with hair pulling. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=292.0s)]
*  This is real. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=294.56s)]
*  You'd better apologize. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  Our heart goes out to Cat Turd tonight who's probably cowering in a litter box somewhere, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=298.0s)]
*  waiting for Adam Kinzinger to show up with sharpened nails, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=301.2s)]
*  mock the Ukrainian flag, get scratched. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=304.4s)]
*  Those are the rules, Cat Turd. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=306.88s)]
*  It's a tough town. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=308.4s)]
*  Meow. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=309.52s)]
*  But speaking of how it will all end, how's it going to end for Adam Kinzinger? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=311.44s)]
*  Well, we suspect it will end like it began, in anonymity. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=315.12s)]
*  In just weeks, Adam Kinzinger will be another CNN contributor and no one will ever see him again. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=318.16s)]
*  But we will never forget him. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=323.36s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger will live forever in our hearts as an example of what a man can be [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=325.76s)]
*  when he stops trying to be a man and unleashes the emotionally fragile divorced single mom within. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=330.64s)]
*  Have another glass of chardonnay and listen to me cry. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=336.64s)]
*  Yes, Ms. Kinzinger, we will. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=339.36s)]
*  So here it is one last time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  I never expected a day to be quite as emotional for me as it has been. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=346.56s)]
*  But you guys won. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=351.04s)]
*  You guys helped. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=356.24s)]
*  You know, democracies are not defined by our bad days. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=359.6s)]
*  Au revoir, Adam Kinzinger. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=368.88s)]
*  See you at SoulCycle. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=371.04s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DwWEiR2tI&t=381.04s)]
