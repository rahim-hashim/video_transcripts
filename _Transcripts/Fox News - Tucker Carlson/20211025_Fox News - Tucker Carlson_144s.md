# Woke employees pressured Facebook to censor conservatives: Alex Marlow
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM)
*  So the Wall Street Journal got ahold of a bunch of internal documents from Facebook, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=0.0s)]
*  from the company's internal racial justice chat room. Of course they have one of those. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=3.36s)]
*  And they found, among many other things, that Facebook employees are obsessed with the site [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=9.68s)]
*  Breitbart. They hate Breitbart. Breitbart shouldn't be allowed to talk. Why is Breitbart on Facebook? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=14.4s)]
*  And so apparently, Facebook cut traffic to Breitbart News by as much as a fifth without [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=18.96s)]
*  telling them. And they also did this to a bunch of other conservative sites. Alex Marlowe runs [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=26.16s)]
*  Breitbart. He joins us tonight to respond to what we've just learned. Alex, thanks so much for coming [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=29.92s)]
*  on. So were you surprised? I mean, I was a little shocked by how open they were. Were you surprised? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=35.04s)]
*  Yeah, I was shocked only by the framing of it. The Wall Street Journal put out the story as if [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=41.36s)]
*  it was going to be some sort of damnation hit piece on Breitbart. And it contained a smoking gun in it, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=46.08s)]
*  which is that these woke SJWs had pressured Facebook senior management to diminishing not [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=51.52s)]
*  just Breitbart's traffic, but traffic across conservative media and deliberately cutting down [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=56.64s)]
*  their most engaged users to favorite corporate, billionaire-backed, multinational conglomerates [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=61.44s)]
*  to promote their news over Breitbart's, which is accurate, which is incredibly popular, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=69.6s)]
*  and it was thriving, not dominating on the platform. It's just so interesting. I mean, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=74.32s)]
*  they have all these different left-wing news outlets, which is almost all of them, and yet [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=79.28s)]
*  they were completely fixated on the idea that Breitbart might have a story on Facebook, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=83.2s)]
*  that they couldn't get over it, like no diversity of opinion. Did you note this? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=87.36s)]
*  Absolutely. Tucker, there's literally billions of Facebook pages, and this one page, for whatever [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=92.72s)]
*  reason, triggers the left at such an unbelievable degree that they have to whine to their bosses to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  try to get us censored. Thankfully, it hasn't totally worked yet, but every Republican member [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=104.48s)]
*  of Congress should take note of this. This came before the 2020 election, Tucker. All the criticism [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=109.04s)]
*  of us were before 2020. These change votes and change minds. Right. Well, that's it. They hate [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=113.92s)]
*  Facebook because they think that Trump voters organized on Facebook. That's why they're trying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=119.12s)]
*  to force Facebook to censor, because we have an election coming up, obviously. You know that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, Alex Marlowe, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWpDqCqeNYM&t=128.96s)]
