# Tucker Carlson: This is ridiculous
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY)
*  But first, to step back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=0.0s)]
*  So, when something this awful happens, something that affects the lives of millions of your [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=1.0s)]
*  fellow Americans, decent people step back for a moment. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=5.8s)]
*  It's a moment that demands reverence and silence to consider what we've just seen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=9.5s)]
*  And then the practical questions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=13.16s)]
*  People are suffering. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=15.26s)]
*  How are they suffering? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=16.26s)]
*  They don't have power. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=17.26s)]
*  They don't have communications. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=18.26s)]
*  How many homes were destroyed? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=19.26s)]
*  You ask questions like that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=20.88s)]
*  You try to assess what this means and the human cost of it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=21.88s)]
*  The one thing you don't do is immediately jump forward to score some sort of cheap and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=25.32s)]
*  sleazy political point from it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=29.72s)]
*  That used to be obvious. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=32.42s)]
*  But for the past several years, it's been clear it's no longer obvious, at least to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=34.28s)]
*  one political party. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=37.96s)]
*  You saw this happen after the forest fires in California two years ago. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=38.96s)]
*  It happened after tornadoes killed people in Midwest last year. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=42.04s)]
*  And it's happening again now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=44.84s)]
*  Immediately, on cable television and on the floor of the legislative bodies across this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=47.08s)]
*  self-described experts are demanding that you accept responsibility for whatever natural [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=52.88s)]
*  disaster has just occurred. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=57.08s)]
*  It's your fault, including for Hurricane Ian. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=58.24s)]
*  You did this because you didn't support giving Joe Biden trillions of dollars to fight climate [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=61.64s)]
*  change. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=66.58s)]
*  So you caused it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=67.58s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=68.58s)]
*  Decades ago, it used to be one or two a season would happen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=69.58s)]
*  Now with climate change and these extreme warm waters, it's almost, you know, it's happening [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=72.68s)]
*  all the time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=76.6s)]
*  This storm, in a way, is kind of bad news for the people that are still trying to deny [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=77.6s)]
*  climate change as a factor. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=82.16s)]
*  Florida Republicans deny climate change as a monster storm barrels towards the coast. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=84.0s)]
*  This will be a first time test for how you adapt to these new, stronger storms on a warmer [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  planet as a result of climate change. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  The threat exacerbated, of course, by climate change. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  Charleston, like Miami, gets water that comes up on a good sunny day. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=102.28s)]
*  Climate change because water levels are rising. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=107.0s)]
*  Our earth is getting warmer and there is just no doubt, I think, left that it is feeding [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=109.32s)]
*  these beasts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=114.08s)]
*  Imagine taking a science lecture from someone as stupid as Stephanie Ruhler, Ali Veshi. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=117.48s)]
*  So on that level, it's ridiculous. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=123.32s)]
*  And it's also, as we just suggested, unseemly and anti-human. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=125.32s)]
*  Of course, people are dying, so wait just a moment before putting forward your demands [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=130.56s)]
*  for more political power. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=137.12s)]
*  But it's also factually untrue. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=138.12s)]
*  So you just heard one hair hat say it used to be one or two hurricanes a season would [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=139.76s)]
*  happen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=143.12s)]
*  Now it's happening all the time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=144.12s)]
*  And you hear this all the time. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=145.12s)]
*  And it's a way of terrifying you into handing politicians more power over your life. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=147.36s)]
*  But the fact is, it's a lie. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=152.76s)]
*  It's not even remotely true. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=154.26s)]
*  I mean, it's not a close call. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=156.56s)]
*  There has been, as a factual matter, no increase in hurricane frequency in the continental [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=158.8s)]
*  United States from 1900 to 2020. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  That's 120 years. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=167.12s)]
*  It's been recorded. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  We have the data. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  They're on your screen right now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  In fact, as Michael Schellenberger has pointed out, someone has actually looked at the numbers, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  the number of landfalling hurricanes has dropped slightly over the past century. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=176.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=181.08s)]
*  We're not sure, but we can probably guess it has nothing to do with climate or your [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=182.08s)]
*  SUV. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  We do know that in that same period, deaths of human beings from natural disasters such [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=187.4s)]
*  as hurricanes have dropped a lot by about 90 percent. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=191.32s)]
*  And the death toll is forecast to drop even more as people respond to the changing environment. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  That's what people do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  Government scientists at the NOAA and even the professional alarmists at the IPCC predict [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=202.8s)]
*  that hurricanes will become 25 percent less frequent throughout the 21st century. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=207.28s)]
*  Oh. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  And that makes sense because the current Atlantic hurricane season is the slowest one in a quarter [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=215.4s)]
*  century. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  So none of that has to downplay or minimize in any way the savagery of Hurricane Ian or [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=222.72s)]
*  the sadness of what it's done to your fellow Americans. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=226.96s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=229.52s)]
*  But it does raise the question, how exactly are you responsible for it? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=231.02s)]
*  Well, of course, you're not in any sense. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=233.88s)]
*  You're not liable for that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=236.56s)]
*  You didn't do that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=237.82s)]
*  You're a normal person. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  You're grieving for the people who were just killed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  They're not trying to score political points on their deaths. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=243.12s)]
*  But Don LaMonde steps into the breach, the breach between fact and rhetoric, with a brand [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  new theory. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=252.76s)]
*  Don LaMonde claims that storms may not have become more frequent, but they definitely [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=254.04s)]
*  become more, quote, intense watch. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=257.0s)]
*  The science shows what the science shows. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  It's undeniable what is happening. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=261.48s)]
*  But listen, let's talk about the storm surge. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Really, what I was trying to explain is just the phenomenon of the intensifying storms [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=266.8s)]
*  over the years. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=271.24s)]
*  I'm not trying to say that one particular storm, we could gauge something. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=273.0s)]
*  But listen, you get an idea. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  You've been doing this for a while. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=279.08s)]
*  I've been covering these for, you know, since I've been in the business for 20 years. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=280.08s)]
*  I've lived on the Gulf Coast. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=283.08s)]
*  You see the intensity of the storms increasing, and that's the science definitely shows that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=285.04s)]
*  So the intensity of the storms has increased. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=290.44s)]
*  And notice how, like all TV presenters, the claim is never proven. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=294.2s)]
*  They never show you how it's true. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=297.84s)]
*  They just assert it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=300.0s)]
*  They become more intense. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=301.82s)]
*  Well, how does Don LeMond know that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=302.82s)]
*  Because of a longitudinal study he's done? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=304.38s)]
*  Well, yeah, in a way, he, quote, lived in the Gulf Coast. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=305.94s)]
*  So he knows the storms are getting more intense because he's been in this business a long [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=309.14s)]
*  time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=312.26s)]
*  Well, is that true? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=313.26s)]
*  It's worth assessing it since you hear it constantly and there's a political reason [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=314.9s)]
*  they're telling you that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=318.26s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=319.84s)]
*  Are the storms getting more intense? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=320.84s)]
*  And if so, how much more intense are they getting? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=321.84s)]
*  Well, we did our level best since this is a new show to get to the bottom of that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=324.85999999999996s)]
*  According to the latest models from the NOAA, the worst case scenario is that hurricanes [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=327.86s)]
*  get 5% stronger this century. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=332.94s)]
*  We're 22 years into the century, 78 years to go. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=335.42s)]
*  So hurricanes are 25% less common and at most 5% more intense. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=340.06s)]
*  Do the math. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=347.18s)]
*  Well, as scientist Roger Pelke put it, quote, even under the most extreme scenarios of climate [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=348.18s)]
*  change, future disasters will look a lot like today's. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=351.74s)]
*  So it's not really about science, is it? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=356.74s)]
*  Because actually there's no science behind these claims. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=359.26s)]
*  No. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=362.62s)]
*  It's what everything is in this intensely politicized country. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=363.86s)]
*  It's another opportunity to punish people who don't vote the right way, to cow them [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=367.72s)]
*  into submission, to seize the moral high ground, to punish your opponents. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=371.74s)]
*  That's why even as bodies are still being identified, and apparently many have not been [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=377.06s)]
*  The view, which apparently is still on the air, mocked the people of Florida for daring [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=382.68s)]
*  to ask disaster relief money from the federal government. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=388.6s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  Governor DeSantis says it's all hands on deck to prepare for what's coming. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=392.76000000000005s)]
*  And that includes reaching across the aisle for help. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  Isn't it socialism when the government helps you? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  So they say, like, social security and Medicare and Medicaid and things like that? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=403.56s)]
*  Yeah, and the riot department's got to come. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=409.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=410.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, socialism. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=411.88s)]
*  Oh, so clever. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=412.88s)]
*  Oh, what an incisive point. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=415.88s)]
*  This show is totally opposed to censorship or deplatforming or pulling anyone off the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=417.84s)]
*  air. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=421.52s)]
*  We're certainly not calling for that in the case of The View. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=422.52s)]
*  But it's an objective matter. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=424.52s)]
*  When that show finally does die a well-deserved death and is gone and forgotten, this will [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  be a slightly better country. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=429.0s)]
*  That's just true. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  So consider what you just saw. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=431.52s)]
*  A hurricane devastates Florida, kills Americans, and the reaction of the morons on The View [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=433.32s)]
*  is to laugh at them, to mock the people who are suffering. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=439.76s)]
*  And while they're doing this, they claim it's really coming from a place of compassion. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=443.76s)]
*  They're laughing at people who are dying because they're better than you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  See how that works? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  Here's Joy Reid. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  It's a bit ironic now that you might have Floridians having to actually pour over the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  borders and go north and get out of the state of Florida in the exact same crisis that we've [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=458.12s)]
*  been talking about on a trolling level in that state for a long time. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=464.28s)]
*  And be careful about attacking people who have to move to save their own lives and safety, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=467.64s)]
*  because you never know when it's your people that have to move, when it's your people [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=473.0s)]
*  who have to migrate, when it's your people who have to get on that road. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=475.96s)]
*  So we throw on a lot of cable news clips on the air, and on one level it's like, who [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=481.58s)]
*  cares what the dummies on cable television say? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=485.26s)]
*  But it's kind of a window into our broader political debate. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=488.8s)]
*  If you wind up in a country where no one can think clearly, when the most educated Harvard [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  graduates like Joy Reid literally can't think in a logical, linear way, they're incapable [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=496.44s)]
*  of rational thought, then over time your whole country becomes incapable of rational thought. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  People just fall out of the habit of thinking like adults, and we're moving toward there. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=507.0s)]
*  So these are the very same people, by the way, who cheered as illegal aliens were removed [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=513.16s)]
*  by force from Martha's Vineyard and sent to a military base. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=518.4s)]
*  They called them trash. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  They took them out within 48 hours with the Army. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  But now they're lecturing you about compassion as they gloat over a deadly hurricane. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=525.44s)]
*  It's time to stop taking them seriously. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=531.28s)]
*  Of course they're not compassionate. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=532.6s)]
*  They don't care about other people. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=533.6s)]
*  What they care about is advancing the political power of the party they belong to. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=535.76s)]
*  And if you need more evidence of that, Joy Reid went on to explain that the hurricane, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=540.36s)]
*  the one we just saw, is not a moment to stop and reflect on the fragility of life. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=549.76s)]
*  It's another reason to keep our border open. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=550.76s)]
*  The reality is that humans, we're literally running from what the climate, from the climate [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=554.72s)]
*  change that we're pretending isn't happening. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=560.96s)]
*  But we're physically being moved around the Earth because of it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=563.0s)]
*  It will actually be the single biggest cause of migration. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=568.72s)]
*  We typically think of migration being caused by conflict and wars and things like that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=571.8000000000001s)]
*  In Syria it triggered it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=575.88s)]
*  In Ukraine, that's not going to be what it is. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  It's actually going to be migration because people can't move. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=579.32s)]
*  Really speaking, prosperous people can move first because they can afford to. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=582.76s)]
*  But eventually when the grain stops growing or the fields keep flooding, the poor people [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=585.52s)]
*  move too. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=589.4s)]
*  And we're going to have to come to terms with the fact that that's going to be the major [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=590.4s)]
*  cause of migration around the world and here in America. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=593.08s)]
*  Imagine when these people go home at night and look in the mirror. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=598.36s)]
*  Ooh, another day of successfully pretending not to be stupid. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=601.76s)]
*  Another day of fooling TV viewers and thinking we know what we're talking about. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=605.6s)]
*  But nobody's fooled. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=608.6s)]
*  Anyone who knows anything, anyone who knows any common sense at all or just the powers [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  of observation that most adults have would know that what they're saying is ridiculous. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=613.52s)]
*  Ian wasn't the first hurricane in Florida. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=617.32s)]
*  Florida gets hurricanes every year. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=619.8000000000001s)]
*  And more Americans have moved to Florida in the past two years than any other state. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=622.1800000000001s)]
*  So actually climate is not forcing people out of Florida. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=626.4200000000001s)]
*  They're somehow moving there to one of our hottest states. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  How does that work exactly? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  They never answer. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=632.72s)]
*  Instead they tell you the solution to climate change to keep our southern border open. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=633.72s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard is still off limits, of course, because that's where their donors live. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  What's so interesting, even as they make the case that the United States deserves to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  keep its borders open, we deserve the punishment that we receive from mass migration because [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=647.36s)]
*  we cause climate change, that's the argument they're making. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=651.32s)]
*  This is atonement for our climate sense. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=654.1800000000001s)]
*  These same people never tell China to open its borders, even though China is by far the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=656.38s)]
*  largest carbon emitter and the largest polluter in conventional terms in the world. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=663.36s)]
*  But no one's ever in China's face about being an ethnostate or racist, not letting [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=668.8s)]
*  non-Han Chinese into the country, which they don't. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=673.8s)]
*  They have no moral obligation to let Burkina Faso move to Beijing. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=677.28s)]
*  Why is that exactly? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=681.1199999999999s)]
*  In fact, leaders of the Democratic Party defend China. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=683.18s)]
*  They defend China. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  The same people tell you climate change is the most important issue in the world. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=689.9599999999999s)]
*  China, of course, the main driver of climate change by their definition, carbon emissions. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=692.8399999999999s)]
*  But those same people tell you that China is doing a great job and we're sinning. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=698.04s)]
*  Here's our climate czar, the cadaverous John Kerry. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=702.4799999999999s)]
*  My question to you is, what can be done about China? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  There's seeming reluctance to participate in affairs of climate control, other nations. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, China, Mike, China, interestingly enough, China has a plan. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=718.1999999999999s)]
*  They put a plan in place. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=722.88s)]
*  We think they could be doing more. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=724.12s)]
*  But China is going to be building more electric vehicles, will be put on the road over the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=726.88s)]
*  next year or so in China than in all the rest of the world put together. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=734.1600000000001s)]
*  They are deploying renewable power at a rate that exceeds all other nations. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  They are the largest manufacturer of renewables in the world. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=743.64s)]
*  And so China is moving. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=748.44s)]
*  So John Kerry, who really is cadaverous, it felt mean to say that, but actually look [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=752.84s)]
*  at the tape, it's pretty accurate. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=757.1600000000001s)]
*  John Kerry is basically doing an infomercial for the Communist Party of China. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=759.2s)]
*  This is the climate czar. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=763.88s)]
*  This is the country that's built more coal plants in the past five years than any place [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=765.52s)]
*  in the world by far, 10X. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=769.48s)]
*  And he's not only sniffing their throne, he's defending them on climate grounds? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=772.84s)]
*  It's not subtle. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=779.2s)]
*  They're not even trying. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=781.1600000000001s)]
*  They don't care about climate change. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=783.36s)]
*  They definitely don't care about natural disasters. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=785.2800000000001s)]
*  They just want power. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's why they suck up to the most powerful guy in the room. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  And that would be Xi, Chairman Xi. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=791.72s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=795.48s)]
*  How deep is their insincerity? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=796.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, last year, during hurricane season, Joe Biden leveraged these natural disasters [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=798.96s)]
*  as a way to sell his vaccines. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=804.2800000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=807.08s)]
*  God forbid a natural disaster strikes, we have to make sure we're ready to be protected [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=808.76s)]

*  Let me be clear. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=817.16s)]
*  If you're in a state where hurricanes often strike, like Florida or the Gulf Coast or [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=818.48s)]
*  into Texas, a vital part of preparing for hurricane season is to get vaccinated now. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=824.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=831.2s)]
*  The lesson the hurricane has in tornadoes and tidal waves and earthquakes is to get [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=832.64s)]

*  Can't we just have a natural disaster that we accept as natural? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=836.92s)]
*  That's why they're called natural disasters, because we didn't cause them. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=841.5999999999999s)]
*  They're products of nature. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=844.4799999999999s)]
*  God's in charge. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=845.8399999999999s)]

*  They think they're in charge of the weather. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=853.92s)]
*  And that's why they just can't give it a break. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=856.52s)]
*  They just can't let people die and their deaths be observed for what they are, which [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  is a tragedy that demands reverence, not posturing, not another stupid political speech. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKNIUWv3zFY&t=863.32s)]
