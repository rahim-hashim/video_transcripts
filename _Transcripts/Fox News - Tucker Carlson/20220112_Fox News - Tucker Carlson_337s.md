# No one energizes the right like Hillary Clinton: Jason Nichols
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU)
*  Either way, it is way past time to get Hillary back into the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=0.0s)]
*  The lady's got a speech to give. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=4.46s)]
*  She wrote it five years ago for her inevitable inauguration, thanks to the Macedonians that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  didn't happen. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=10.94s)]
*  But she never threw it away. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=12.3s)]
*  She still got the speech. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=14.02s)]
*  Last month, she read a portion of it on NBC News. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=16.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=18.64s)]
*  I dream of going up to her and sitting down next to her, taking her in my arms and saying, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=19.64s)]
*  Look at me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=28.92s)]
*  Listen to me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=30.540000000000003s)]
*  You will survive. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=32.54s)]
*  You will have a good family of your own and three children. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=34.84s)]
*  And as hard as it might be to imagine, your daughter will grow up and become the president [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=39.92s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=47.1s)]
*  Who's she crying for? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=50.28s)]
*  Herself. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=51.64s)]
*  In case you're confused by the context there, that was Hillary telling her deceased mother [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=52.64s)]
*  that everything is going to be okay because Hillary has been elected president of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  United States. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  No more tears. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=60.8s)]
*  No more anxiety. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=61.98s)]
*  We're going to make it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=63.16s)]
*  We've got a woman in the White House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=64.16s)]
*  A lot's happened since Hillary Clinton wrote those words. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=66.12s)]
*  It's a different country now than it was five years ago. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=68.24s)]
*  But Hillary Clinton hasn't changed. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=71.08s)]
*  Her primary interests remain exactly what they always were. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=72.6s)]
*  She's still talking with endless and undimmed enthusiasm about herself. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  We don't know what's in the rest of her victory speech. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=80.88s)]
*  We're going to have to wait until January of 2025 to find out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=82.36s)]
*  The one thing we can safely assume, it ends with a cackle and a finger. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=86.16s)]
*  Jason Nichols, the co-host of Vince and Jason Save the Nation, along with Vince Colonies, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  is a long-time Democrat and perfect for this conversation. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=95.92s)]
*  Jason Nichols joins us now, our friend. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=98.8s)]
*  Great to see you, Jason. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=100.64s)]
*  So Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=101.84s)]
*  Democrats made the case, and as noted, I think it's an entirely fair case, that it was Hillary [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=104.84s)]
*  Clinton's right to be president of the United States. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=109.92s)]
*  It was in fact her destiny and God's will. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=112.08s)]
*  It was stolen from her by the Macedonians. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  So why wouldn't that still be true? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=116.36s)]
*  Why doesn't she have a moral right to the presidency in 2024? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=118.08s)]
*  Well first of all, you know, this is almost like Groundhog Day if it were a horror movie. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  This is such a bad idea. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=129.6s)]
*  I'm surprised someone actually put the pen to paper to actually say this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  Number one, as you alluded to, she's 77 years old, so when people are talking about Joe [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=135.76s)]
*  Biden's energy levels, she's at the same age as Trump and Biden and all these people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=141.16000000000003s)]
*  And the Democrats say that they that we want new leadership and younger leadership. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=146.68s)]
*  The other element of this is no one energizes the right the way Hillary Clinton does. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=151.28s)]
*  The same thing with Democrats and Donald Trump. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  When you mentioned Donald Trump, now they're having trouble messaging because Donald Trump [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  isn't on the ballot. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  So Hillary Clinton does the same thing, gets people excited on the right, and they're [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=166.38s)]
*  going to go out and vote against her, which makes it really difficult for Democrats. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=171.1s)]
*  And the other thing that I would say, Bill is a liability. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=175.14s)]
*  Can I just one correction? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm on the right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=179.14s)]
*  I'm enervated by Hillary Clinton. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=180.78s)]
*  I'm totally exhausted just thinking about her. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=182.42s)]
*  It's just like it's a bottomless well of narcissism and it sucks me in every time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=184.42s)]
*  I start thinking about her as much as she thinks about herself and that's bad. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=188.46s)]
*  But again, you will go out and vote against her. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=193.78s)]
*  I'm almost positive. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=196.5s)]
*  Fair, fair. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=198.5s)]
*  The other thing that I'll say is that, you know, the backbone of the Democratic Party [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=200.78s)]
*  is African American women and African American women will be incensed and feel betrayed if [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  Hillary Clinton comes back and jumps the line on Kamala Harris. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=213.82s)]
*  And if African American women, even a small sliver, a small percentage, sit on their hands, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=219.38000000000002s)]
*  you're not going to win Georgia, you're not going to win Pennsylvania, you're not going [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=225.34s)]
*  to win a lot of these states that are very necessary to win. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  Look, you may be absolutely right as a political matter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  I suspect that you are. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=234.3s)]
*  But as a moral matter, 30 years ago, Kamala Harris wasn't even Willie Brown's girlfriend [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=235.74s)]
*  yet. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=240.5s)]
*  I mean, I think she was still in high school in Canada. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=241.5s)]
*  No, I'm not being mean, I'm just honest. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=243.86s)]
*  So Hillary Clinton has been in this game a long time and I do think it's fair to say [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=246.26s)]
*  that if anyone's earned it in the Democratic Party, it's certainly her. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=250.1s)]
*  It wouldn't be jumping the line exactly, would it? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=253.42s)]
*  Yeah, a long, disgraceful career, but still long. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=256.02s)]
*  She's had a long career. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=259.62s)]
*  She has a lot of accomplishments and sometimes you have to be able to walk away and say, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=260.7s)]
*  hey, I did great things. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=266.06s)]
*  You know, I became secretary of state. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=267.82s)]
*  People have to call me secretary of Clinton. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=270.14s)]
*  They're going to call me that for the rest of my career or the rest of my life, I should [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=272.06s)]
*  say, and move on. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=275.54s)]
*  And the vice president of the United States right now is Kamala Harris. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think people will feel disgusted. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=283.1s)]
*  I don't care how much hot sauce she uses and how often she goes on the breakfast club, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=285.3s)]
*  African American women will feel disgusted if she jumps the line. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=291.02000000000004s)]
*  The last thing is that Bill Clinton is a liability. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=295.1s)]
*  He took a lot of private jet flights on, you know, a couple of people's jets that I won't [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=299.06s)]
*  say. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=303.86s)]
*  That will come back. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=305.18s)]
*  You know, that will come back to bite him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=306.18s)]
*  Donald Trump was on those jets as well. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  I think you're speaking of Jeffrey Epstein, who Hillary Clinton absolutely did not kill. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=311.5s)]
*  And I mean that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=316.1s)]
*  She did not. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=317.1s)]
*  So now that we've established that, I want to thank you, Jason Nichols, for coming on [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=318.1s)]

*  Hey, great seeing you, Tucker. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9uYkKzHKU&t=323.26s)]
