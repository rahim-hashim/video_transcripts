# Tucker eviscerates Dems for exploiting ‘suffering’ people
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk)
*  10% of Americans have depression. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=0.0s)]
*  They tell you it's all chemical imbalance in the brain. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=2.96s)]
*  That's a lie. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=5.16s)]
*  Some of it may be. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=6.0s)]
*  But depression is also a product of living a life [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=7.4s)]
*  you're not supposed to be living. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=10.32s)]
*  And if your mercenary wife [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  and all the political consultants around you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=14.88s)]
*  tell you you have to be in the US Senate [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=16.3s)]
*  and you don't want to be in the US Senate, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=17.72s)]
*  you're not ready to serve in the US Senate, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=19.04s)]
*  maybe it gives you depression. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=21.04s)]
*  That's not crazy, actually, is an explanation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=22.1s)]
*  Those people should have to answer for it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=24.6s)]
*  who did this damn. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  So it's kind of interesting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=28.16s)]
*  that you're not hearing our leaders talk that much [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=29.2s)]
*  about black people anymore. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=31.32s)]
*  Remember all the neoliberals [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=32.64s)]
*  were obsessed telling you about black people. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=33.6s)]
*  Why aren't they talking about black people anymore? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=35.76s)]
*  Three years after George Floyd, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=37.16s)]
*  actually the lives of many African Americans, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=38.92s)]
*  real people, have gotten a lot worse. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=41.84s)]
*  Following the 2020 Floyd riots, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=44.96s)]
*  African American deaths by homicide [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=46.9s)]
*  reached levels never seen before in this country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=49.08s)]
*  Someone should stop and ask, why is that? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=51.92s)]
*  But no one in the Democratic Party is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  because they don't care. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=57.32s)]
*  They don't have to care [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=58.16s)]
*  because they have a new class of victims [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  to exploit for political power. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=61.44s)]
*  Out with black people, in with transgenderists. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=63.44s)]
*  We're going to exploit their suffering [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  to become more powerful. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=69.24s)]
*  And of course, big corporations [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=70.28s)]
*  are taking the lead as they always do. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  Bud Light just honored a man who dresses up [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=72.84s)]
*  like a little girl called Dylan Mulvaney. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=77.44s)]
*  I got some Bud Lights for us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=79.32s)]
*  So I kept hearing about this thing called March Madness [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=81.36s)]
*  and I thought we were all just having a hectic month, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=84.88s)]
*  but it turns out it has something to do with sports. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=87.44s)]
*  And I'm not sure exactly which sport, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=90.48s)]
*  but either way it's a cause to celebrate. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=93.22s)]
*  This month I celebrated my day 365 of womanhood [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=97.64s)]
*  and Bud Light sent me possibly the best gift ever, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=100.96s)]
*  a can with my face on it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=104.36s)]
*  So do you think that the people in charge [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=107.44s)]
*  care about that person or any transgender person? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=110.44s)]
*  Really, if they did, they might ask questions like, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=114.8s)]
*  is the suicide rate among young people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=117.0s)]
*  who are getting hormone treatments rising or falling? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=119.48s)]
*  Because if you cared, you'd want to know that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=122.6s)]
*  They don't want to know, they don't care. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=123.92s)]
*  You think Sandy Corteza even thinks about that? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=125.16s)]
*  No, the point is getting power from the suffering of others. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=127.44s)]
*  And if you've decided you're another sex, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=131.8s)]
*  you're definitely suffering on many, many levels. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=133.36s)]
*  But point that out and you get attacked. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=135.96s)]
*  That happened to our friend, Billboard Chris in Canada. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=139.8s)]
*  He went to a trans rally in Vancouver on Friday. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=142.32s)]
*  Here's what happened to him while there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=146.2s)]
*  You suck, you suck. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=148.28s)]
*  You, you're not wanted. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=150.11999999999998s)]
*  You, you're an idiot. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=152.28s)]
*  You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=154.28s)]
*  Hey, get the. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=167.83999999999997s)]
*  Get the. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=168.68s)]
*  So who's the aggressor there? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=173.68s)]
*  Well, it wasn't the man who calls himself Billboard Chris. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=176.24s)]
*  He was assaulted. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=178.56s)]
*  And when he reported his assault to the, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=179.84s)]
*  air quotes here, police, the police refused to investigate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=182.44s)]
*  Within seconds, I was surrounded, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=188.56s)]
*  not allowed to walk freely, pushed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=191.52s)]
*  As you can see, my nose is bleeding. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=196.0s)]
*  They just walked up to him and assaulted him. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=199.36s)]
*  You want to see, I don't, where's the video? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=200.4s)]
*  I have it on my camera, but I'm filming right now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=205.24s)]
*  Yeah, I can, I can show it to you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  How about you show it to me? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=210.08s)]
*  Are you going to do something about it if I do? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=211.4s)]
*  If I actually see an assault and not claim it an assault. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  No, that's fine. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=217.8s)]
*  You'd think that happened, ma'am. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=219.52s)]
*  You think he did it to himself or something? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=221.24s)]
*  People can do these things to hurt themselves on purpose. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  You don't honestly think that this man just [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=227.68s)]
*  punched himself on purpose. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=229.68s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=231.72s)]
*  Oh, the rosy cheeked face of tyranny. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=233.84s)]
*  She could be working in the city bank HR department. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=236.4s)]
*  Maybe she will be someday. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=238.84s)]
*  She's not the only one. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=240.96s)]
*  The police chief, the deputy police chief rather, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  Howard Chow of Vancouver has taken her side. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=244.84s)]
*  He says he's appalled, not that people are being bashed [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=248.08s)]
*  in the face for their political views, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=250.32s)]
*  but because some people don't like the fact [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=252.12s)]
*  the police didn't respond. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=254.8s)]
*  He hasn't condemned the militants who attacked that man. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  That's because in Canada, as in this country, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=260.48s)]
*  militants with the right cause, the trans cause, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=263.12s)]
*  can do whatever they want. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=267.88s)]
*  They can even kill Christian children in school [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=268.72s)]
*  and they're the victims. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urHVpeJzmFk&t=272.08000000000004s)]
