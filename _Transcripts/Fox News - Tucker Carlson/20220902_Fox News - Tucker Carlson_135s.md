# Tucker Carlson: Joe Biden really has crossed over into a dangerous place
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0)
*  He made fun of it at the top of the show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=0.0s)]
*  because we didn't really know how else to respond, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=1.74s)]
*  but Joe Biden really has crossed over [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=4.24s)]
*  into a very dangerous, very dangerous place. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=5.94s)]
*  Tonight, he declared in a speech in Philadelphia [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  that anyone who disagrees with him is a threat to the country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=10.32s)]
*  Here's part of what Biden said. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=14.18s)]
*  Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=16.56s)]
*  Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=22.52s)]
*  represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=25.32s)]
*  of our republic, that the Republican Party today [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=29.8s)]
*  is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=32.74s)]
*  and the MAGA Republicans. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=36.94s)]
*  And that is a threat to this country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=39.44s)]
*  Yeah, they're a threat, says the guy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=43.68s)]
*  with the blood-red Nazi background [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=45.38s)]
*  and Marines standing behind him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  It's a complete outrage that this is being sanctioned [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=49.46s)]
*  as a White House event. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  In other words, that this is the approved position [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  of our government. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=56.36s)]
*  It's totally immoral. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=58.32s)]
*  And then the guy who encouraged riots in 2020 [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=59.82s)]
*  accused MAGA Republicans of somehow threatening [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=62.42s)]
*  the rule of law in the United States. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=64.8s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=66.42s)]
*  MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=68.0s)]
*  They do not believe in the rule of law. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=71.74s)]
*  They do not recognize the will of the people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=73.3s)]
*  They refuse to accept the results of a free election, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=76.94s)]
*  and they're working right now, as I speak, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=80.58s)]
*  in state after state to give power to decide elections [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=83.64s)]
*  in America to partisans and cronies, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=88.48s)]
*  empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=91.88s)]
*  MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=97.12s)]
*  They promote authoritarian leaders, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=101.78s)]
*  and they fan the flames of political violence [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=103.56s)]
*  that are a threat to our personal rights, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=106.92s)]
*  to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=110.52s)]
*  to the very soul of this country. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=114.22s)]
*  This is truly nuts and threatening [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=117.66s)]
*  to the future of the United States. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=121.44s)]
*  It's hard to believe he just did that, but he did. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFKT-uGQW0&t=122.74s)]
