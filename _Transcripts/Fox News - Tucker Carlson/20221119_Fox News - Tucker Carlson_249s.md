# Babylon Bee CEO: The left's insane ideology needs to be propped up
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0)
*  So, it may be looking back, say, 10 years from now, that one of the most consequential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=0.0s)]
*  decisions in the history of big tech may have been Twitter's snap decision to ban the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=4.12s)]
*  satire site Babylon Beat. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  What did the site do wrong? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=12.96s)]
*  Well, it mocked Rachel Levine, the fake trans admiral that Joe Biden insists we describe [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=14.52s)]
*  as a man. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=21.8s)]
*  Twitter's ban was publicized. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk saw it and was outraged by it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=26.72s)]
*  Not because he's a right winger, but because he believes in the First Amendment. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=30.32s)]
*  Fast forward to today, Elon Musk now owns Twitter, and the Biden administration is trying [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=34.2s)]
*  to destroy him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=39.12s)]
*  We're talking about investigating him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=40.12s)]
*  The president from the podium not long ago suggested he might be a threat to national [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=41.84s)]
*  security. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  So, all of this began with the banning of the Babylon Beat. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Seth Dillon is the CEO of Babylon Beat. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  His conversation with Elon Musk, we played part of it a moment ago. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=52.8s)]
*  Seth, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  So Elon Musk seemed to see—a lot of people have been banned on Twitter, but when you [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=58.84s)]
*  got banned, he seemed to see it as a red line being crossed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=63.0s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=67.14s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think it all goes back to the primary issue of free speech. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=68.64s)]
*  He calls himself a free speech absolutist. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=75.88s)]
*  And one of the things that free speech protects is the right to make jokes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=78.44s)]
*  You know, you have the right to be wrong. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=82.16s)]
*  You have the right to make jokes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=83.16s)]
*  And you can't even laugh. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=84.92s)]
*  You know, you can't even poke fun at these ideas, especially these ideas that are really [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=85.92s)]
*  crazy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  We have this situation where, you know, this worldview needs to be propped up. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  The left's insane ideology needs to be propped up by silencing people on the other side, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  especially people who mock them and expose their foolishness. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=99.4s)]
*  You know, I think Musk saw that as being problematic. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=102.36s)]
*  And so it's part of the reason, I guess, why he decided to step in and take some action. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad he did. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=108.56s)]
*  Do you think there are so—he's the richest man in the world, famously, or was on the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  day he bought it, in any case. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=113.72000000000001s)]
*  But there's so much institutional resistance to allowing Americans to speak freely. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=115.84s)]
*  Do you think he will be able to restore free speech, legal speech—might be a better definition—to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  Twitter? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, for all of our sakes, I hope so. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  There is a lot of resistance. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=133.24s)]
*  You know, he's facing pressure from advertisers who are facing pressure from these activist [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=134.24s)]
*  groups. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  What he's threatened right now is this system that they had set up, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  They have all this power. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=142.36s)]
*  They've empowered these activists by basically giving them a sword and a shield, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=143.74s)]
*  They can strike down anything as misinformation or hate speech that they want. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  They can smear you all that they want. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=150.9s)]
*  And then they have a shield, on the other hand—that's their sword. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=152.3s)]
*  They have a shield, on the other hand, where you can't make fun of them, you can't [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=154.9s)]
*  criticize them, or you get banned. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=157.74s)]
*  Musk has threatened to take away that shield. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=160.34s)]
*  And they will fight, I think, to the death to try to prevent him from doing that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  So he's got a tough battle ahead of him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=166.06s)]
*  And I think you're absolutely right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=169.06s)]
*  I don't think you're overstating it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=170.26s)]
*  I think they—and I hate the word existential, but that's what this is for them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=171.66s)]
*  Did you understand how important censorship was for the people currently in charge to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=175.22s)]
*  keep their power? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they seem to think it's the most important thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  They do. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=187.54s)]
*  And, I mean, there's a reason for that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  You know, mockery and criticism, you know, it can expose foolishness. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=189.66s)]
*  It can make you look silly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=195.22s)]
*  I think that's the big weak point, especially when the ideas that you're trying to defend [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=196.9s)]
*  are indefensible. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=201.66s)]
*  You know, you don't want to have arguments about it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=202.66s)]
*  You want to shut down the debate before the debate even happens. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=204.78s)]
*  You know, I didn't expect that it would come to the point that it's come to, and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=207.42s)]
*  that we would see the kind of content moderation, as they like to call it, that we're seeing, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=211.34s)]
*  that basically just silences one side of the discussion and takes out even people who are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=215.54s)]
*  trying to use humor effectively in the conversation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=219.73999999999998s)]
*  But, you know, here we are. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=222.7s)]
*  We're in this place. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=224.26s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=225.26s)]
*  I'm excited. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=226.26s)]
*  I'm hopeful that maybe, you know, Musk will be able to fight back and do something about [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=227.26s)]
*  this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he certainly is. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=232.06s)]
*  Seth Dillon, whose banning started it all. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=234.58s)]
*  Great to see you tonight. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=237.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7Ad_631z0&t=238.18s)]
