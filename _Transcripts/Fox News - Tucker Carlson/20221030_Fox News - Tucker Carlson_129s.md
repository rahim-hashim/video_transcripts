# Glenn Greenwald: The media enjoys being this brazen
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw)
*  Glenn Greenwald is an independent journalist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=0.0s)]
*  His work is on Substack. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=1.96s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=2.92s)]
*  Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=3.96s)]
*  There's something about the unwillingness of people [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=6.16s)]
*  to acknowledge the obvious. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=8.88s)]
*  There was a candidate whose views I really liked, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=10.4s)]
*  who had a performance like that, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=12.56s)]
*  like Feteman's performance. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  I hope I'd be honest enough to say, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=14.96s)]
*  you know, I agree with the guy, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=16.16s)]
*  but that was disqualifying. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=17.0s)]
*  There's something about the unwillingness [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=18.6s)]
*  to admit what everyone knows is true, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=20.3s)]
*  that, oh, it's chilling. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=22.28s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=23.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a form of power. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=26.48s)]
*  You know, so often George Orwell [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=27.98s)]
*  was so prescient in what he predicted [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=29.68s)]
*  about how authoritarianism and tyranny would work. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  And in 1984, the novel we all read in high school [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=34.72s)]
*  and his warning about how authoritarianism would happen, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=37.22s)]
*  he described a tyrannical party [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  and he described as their final [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=41.88s)]
*  and most essential command [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=43.9s)]
*  that you are to ignore the evidence [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=46.64s)]
*  of your own eyes and ears. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=48.68s)]
*  If you can get a citizen order to do that, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=50.8s)]
*  to trust what they're told [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  more than what they're seeing and hearing on their own, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=56.32s)]
*  that is a population that is put into extreme subservience. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=59.02s)]
*  And I think on some level, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  the media almost likes being this brazen in their lives. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=64.94s)]
*  Remember when we all witnessed Joe Biden, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=68.54s)]
*  who we've seen in public life for 50 years, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=70.66s)]
*  so obviously suffering cognitive decline, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=72.78s)]
*  they decided to tell us [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  it wasn't really cognitive decline [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=77.22s)]
*  that he had a stutter, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=78.82000000000001s)]
*  a stutter that was never there before. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=80.58s)]
*  Half the time he doesn't know where he is, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=82.98s)]
*  half the time he falls asleep in interviews now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  And if you raise any of these things, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=87.66s)]
*  we're told you're a big people who stutter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=89.66s)]
*  This is what they're doing now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  They completely got caught lying. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=94.14s)]
*  They attacked this young reporter [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=96.02s)]
*  for doing what her job is, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=98.02s)]
*  but which they see as a crime, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=100.1s)]
*  which is reporting things derogatory [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=101.58s)]
*  or damaging to the Democratic Party. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=103.38s)]
*  And now they just are so brazen about it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=105.52s)]
*  that they're going to insist [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=108.22s)]
*  that what you're seeing is not really what you're seeing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=109.34s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=112.34s)]
*  That's the heart of it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=113.78s)]
*  It's Orwell's observation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for pointing that out, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=116.62s)]
*  that if they can make you ignore something you know is true, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=117.78s)]
*  then they have control over you completely. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=121.78s)]
*  You're a slave. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald, thank you very much. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=125.66000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQ2nG1HIfw&t=127.62s)]
