# 'Conservative warrior' punches back against 'RINO' establishment
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0)
*  So Arkansas is one of the most conservative states in the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=0.0s)]
*  How do you know that? We just poll the people who live there and what they think about the various issues. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=3.2s)]
*  But like a lot of conservative states, Arkansas is governed by some very liberal Republicans. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=7.2s)]
*  So Jake Beckett is not one of them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=12.0s)]
*  He's running for Senate in the primary as a Republican in the state of Arkansas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=14.0s)]
*  And it looks like not everyone is for that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  So for several weeks, Jake Beckett's first name was completely wrong on thousands of ballots. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=20.96s)]
*  Now that's a problem for him because another candidate with the same last name, Beckett, is also in the ballot. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=26.64s)]
*  Election officials told us today they have fixed the problem, but voting has already started in the Arkansas primary. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=32.08s)]
*  Now Jake Beckett is suing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  We thought this was interesting, so we asked him to come on and explain what's happening to us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=40.16s)]
*  Jake, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=43.2s)]
*  It's hard not to see, and maybe you don't want to say this out loud, but from an outsider's perspective, it almost seems like sabotage [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=45.28s)]
*  by your own party. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, I'll say it sucker. Here in Arkansas, we have a lot of Republicans, but not very many conservative warriors. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  And that's who I am. At my core, I'm a warrior. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  And the establishments lined up against me. They have four or five super PACs running non-stop attack ads. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=63.2s)]
*  There's probably one coming up on your next commercial break here in Arkansas. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  But what happened is early voting started on Monday, and we discovered we had outraged voters from multiple Arkansas counties [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  reaching out to me with screenshots of the ballot boxes and these voting machines. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=78.16s)]
*  My name was wrong. It said Jack Beckett instead of Jake Beckett. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=82.56s)]
*  So we reached out to these counties and we expected they'd be surprised. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=86.0s)]
*  You know, oh my gosh, the ballots are wrong. No, they knew Tucker. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=89.52s)]
*  We have proof. They admitted that for three weeks before early voting started, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=93.28s)]
*  they knew my name was going to be wrong and said nothing in violation of Arkansas state law. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=97.2s)]
*  So look, here's what happened, Tucker. They thought I was part of the old right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=102.8s)]
*  They thought I was one of these establishment rhinos who was just going to take it lying down, say, okay, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=106.16s)]
*  you know, all shucks. We'll get them next time. No, Tucker. I punched back. I'm going to do business as business is being done. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=111.2s)]
*  I'm part of the new right. We filed lawsuits. We took them to court. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  Today in court, the judge said this whole situation was deeply troubling and all of a sudden, Tucker, voila, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=121.28s)]
*  they started fixing these voting machines and these ballots they originally told us in a lie were unfixable. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  So we already got them on the run, Tucker, here in Arkansas. They've already fixed them in one county. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=133.52s)]
*  We're going to make sure they verify. You know, as Reagan said, trust but verify. We skipped the trust. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=138.56s)]
*  We're going straight to verify. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=143.2s)]
*  We're going to make sure on Monday that all 75 Arkansas counties have the correct name on the ballot. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  That's Jake Beckett for U.S. Senate, not Jack. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=150.08s)]
*  But even if it says Jack, vote for Jack because look, I'm not going to D.C. to be a part of the establishment regime, the uniparty. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=152.96s)]
*  I'm a conservative warrior. I'm going to fight for the citizens of Arkansas on election integrity because look, Tucker, at the end of the day, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=160.4s)]
*  this should not be a partisan issue, election integrity. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=167.12s)]
*  Look, if you have the courage to put your name on the ballot to run, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  if you love your country enough to run for office and serve our country, if you're Republican, Democrat, Green Party, who cares? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=172.8s)]
*  I don't care what office you're seeking, U.S. Senate or dog catcher. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=178.56s)]
*  You deserve to have the voters be fully informed, be fully enfranchised and know who they're voting for. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  So when I win this race, Tucker, when I win this primary, win this runoff if necessary and go to the U.S. Senate, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to turn the guns of the Arkansas Rhino establishment inward. I'm going to fix this once and for all. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=193.84s)]
*  And I'm going to make sure Arkansas has secure elections. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=200.08s)]
*  Yeah, and politicians who represent the people of Arkansas, you know, Asa Hutchinson does not represent your average Arkansas Republican. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=202.88s)]
*  Sorry, I don't get any. Jake Beckett, I appreciate you're coming on tonight. Godspeed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=209.84s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. Thank you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHY3uIdZ_-0&t=214.32s)]
