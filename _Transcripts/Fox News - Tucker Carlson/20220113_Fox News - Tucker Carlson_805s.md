# Tucker: This is worse than we thought
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight there was a lot going on right around the time of the last presidential inauguration. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=2.44s)]
*  So you may have missed that on his very first day as president, Joe Biden ordered federal [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=7.36s)]
*  law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prepare a review of how the administration [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=12.72s)]
*  should fight terrorism. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=17.32s)]
*  By last June, that report was complete. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=19.26s)]
*  It concluded that after more than 20 years, Islamic terror is no longer the greatest threat [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=21.28s)]
*  to this country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=26.38s)]
*  Instead the agencies declared that domestic political extremism is quote, the most urgent [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=27.92s)]
*  terrorism threat the United States faces today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=33.6s)]
*  That's a very stark assessment. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=37.2s)]
*  So you have to ask who exactly are these terrorists who threaten us so urgently? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=38.2s)]
*  And they're not who you might expect. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=42.94s)]
*  The report did not even mention the BLM riots, the deadly BLM riots that had just taken place. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=44.74s)]
*  There wasn't a word about Antifa. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=50.3s)]
*  There was nothing about the gunmen who murdered 800 Americans in the city of Chicago last [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=51.3s)]
*  year, many of them children. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=55.92s)]
*  No, they weren't there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=57.04s)]
*  Instead, the Biden administration declared that the quote, most lethal elements of today's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=58.04s)]
*  domestic terror threat are political conservatives. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=63.4s)]
*  They're people who disagree with Joe Biden. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=66.56s)]
*  Now that report was released almost exactly six months ago, six months ago this Friday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=69.92s)]
*  It received relatively little attention and hasn't since. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=74.48s)]
*  And no major news organization even asked the most obvious question. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=77.88s)]
*  These terrorists who threaten us, where are they? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=81.94s)]
*  If Trump voters are really the most quote, lethal threat that our country faces today, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=85.38s)]
*  where are all the people they've killed? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=90.38s)]
*  That's not an easy question to answer. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=92.94s)]
*  Just look at the numbers, which are fairly tidally kept. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=94.56s)]
*  Take a look at all the Americans who died by violence over the past 12 months. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=98.36s)]
*  And there are many thousands and thousands of Americans. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=101.66s)]
*  I'm going to ask a simple question. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=104.06s)]
*  How many of them were killed by right wingers for political reasons? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  Not many. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=110.44s)]
*  Or since we're talking about threats here, pose the question another way. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=111.7s)]
*  Are you more in danger walking through a neighborhood that votes 90% Democrat or a neighborhood [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  that votes 90% Republican? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=124.38s)]
*  This claim is ridiculous on its face. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=125.78s)]
*  There is no substantial right wing terror threat in this country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=129.12s)]
*  Certainly not in relative terms. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=132.78s)]
*  There just isn't. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=133.88s)]
*  And no one's shown there is. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=136.02s)]
*  The White House knows this, of course. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=137.9s)]
*  They can read the numbers as well as anyone else can. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=139.36s)]
*  So they're working hard to create the illusion of that threat. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=141.84s)]
*  Much hangs on their ability to do that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=145.34s)]
*  You may remember the story this fall about a group called the National School Boards [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  Association, which sent a letter to the feds asking the DOJ to take a look at parents who [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  don't like their kids' curriculums. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=156.44000000000003s)]
*  Well, the Justice Department responded immediately to that letter, talking about customer service. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=158.24s)]
*  Days later, the attorney general announced the FBI would investigate moms who dared to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=163.24s)]
*  complain at school board meetings as potential terrorists. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=167.84s)]
*  Many people were shocked by this story, but we just learned it's worse even than we thought [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=172.0s)]
*  it was. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=176.12s)]
*  A new Freedom of Information Act request has revealed that the National School Boards Association [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=177.12s)]
*  asked the feds to investigate parents because the feds asked them to ask the feds to investigate [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=182.24s)]
*  parents. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=186.96s)]
*  See how that works? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=187.96s)]
*  Apparently, the Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, told school board administrators [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=189.44s)]
*  to write their letter to the White House. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=193.68s)]
*  The White House then used that letter as a pretext to begin a crackdown on parents. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=195.84s)]
*  See how that works? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=201.6s)]
*  The snake eating its tail. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=202.6s)]
*  When you don't have enough domestic terrorists to justify a political purge, then you just [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=204.2s)]
*  go ahead and create them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=208.24s)]
*  And that's exactly what they've been doing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=209.4s)]
*  This week, the campaign against this new American al-Qaeda entered a new and very ominous phase. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=211.6s)]
*  Again, little noticed by the national media. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=217.4s)]
*  This Tuesday, two days ago, the DOJ announced the creation of a new domestic terrorism unit. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=220.24s)]
*  What will it do? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=225.6s)]
*  Well, it will target, quote, anti-authority ideologues. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=226.6s)]
*  Anti-authority ideologues. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=230.88s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, this country was founded by people who are anti-authority ideologues. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=231.88s)]
*  That's why they created America and baked the idea of opposing authority, so it doesn't [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=237.4s)]
*  get too big and take over your life, into our founding documents. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=242.2s)]
*  These ideas are central to the American idea. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=246.44s)]
*  In fact, they are the American idea. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=248.92s)]
*  But in this administration, they are now crimes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=251.2s)]
*  Here's Matt Olson, the assistant attorney general, explaining. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=253.8s)]
*  We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=256.76s)]
*  That is, individuals in the United States who seek to commit violent criminal acts in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  furtherance of domestic social or political goals. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  Domestic violent extremists are often motivated by a mix of ideologies and personal grievances. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=272.24s)]
*  We've seen a growing threat from those who are motivated by racial animus, as well as [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=278.16s)]
*  those who ascribe to extremist anti-government and anti-authority ideologies. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  I've decided to establish a domestic terrorism unit to augment our existing approach. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=288.44s)]
*  This group of dedicated attorneys will focus on the domestic terrorism threat. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  Who's the threat to the country? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=300.88s)]
*  That guy is the threat to the country and the people working for him and those propping [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  him up and the people spreading the core lie here, which is that American citizens [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=305.76s)]
*  who distrust the government or don't like its policies are terrorists. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=312.96s)]
*  Just today on MSNBC, Jason Johnson, one of its contributors, described the entire Republican [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=317.32s)]
*  party as a terrorist organization. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  So you can see where this is going. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=324.76s)]
*  Again, and we're quoting now, this is the assistant attorney general, we have seen a [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=326.64s)]
*  growing threat from those who ascribe to anti-government and anti-authority ideologies. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  Really, is that threat growing? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=334.4s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=337.08s)]
*  Let's see here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=338.08s)]
*  That threat is being used to justify the creation of this agency. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=339.08s)]
*  But it's not rooted in reality. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=342.08s)]
*  Twenty-seven years ago, back in 1995, you'll remember, 168 people were murdered in the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  Oklahoma City bombing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=348.24s)]
*  Another 700 were injured. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=349.96s)]
*  Now the investigation into what happened that day involved nearly 30,000 interviews. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=352.32s)]
*  Investigators gathered 7,000 pounds of evidence. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  We could go on. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=361.08s)]
*  It was an enormous investigation. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=362.08s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland, by the way, was part of it at the time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  Here's the point. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=367.28s)]
*  Despite the size of that investigation, no one suggested, even hinted, that we might [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=368.28s)]
*  need to create a new domestic terror division within the DOJ to handle the problem. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=375.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=379.76s)]
*  The whole thing was handled by FBI field offices, as things like this had been for many decades. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=380.76s)]
*  The FBI field offices did their jobs. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=386.8s)]
*  The man accused of doing it got the death penalty. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  And you may have noticed it didn't happen again. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=391.2s)]
*  And then Joe Biden became president. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=394.0s)]
*  And the number of so-called domestic terror investigations more than doubled. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  So the question is, what exactly are they investigating? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=401.4s)]
*  If there's no substantial death toll from these terrorists in our midst, what exactly [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  are the feds looking into? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, they're taking a close look at crimes like the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer, a plot that helped her political fortunes considerably. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=415.32s)]
*  What did it consist of? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=420.08s)]
*  Well, that conspiracy in the end turned out to have more FBI agents and informants involved [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=421.28s)]
*  than would-be kidnappers. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  The guy the feds said were running it turned out to be homeless. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  He was living in the basement of a vacuum repair shop. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=432.0s)]
*  His friends called him Captain Autism. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  And they called him that for a reason. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=438.32s)]
*  He wasn't the ringleader of anything. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=440.52s)]
*  He couldn't have been. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=443.12s)]
*  The whole thing was ridiculous. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=444.12s)]
*  But it stoked the storyline. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=446.56s)]
*  It was politically expedient, and so the media uncritically promoted it again and again, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=448.16s)]
*  as if it were real. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=452.04s)]
*  The media's job, by the way, to remind you, is to push back against government statements [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=453.24s)]
*  to find out if they're actually true. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=457.6s)]
*  Because it turns out politicians may say things for political reasons. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=459.56s)]
*  And it's the media's job to discern truth from spin. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=462.52s)]
*  The media's job is not to act as spokesmen for the people in power. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=467.52s)]
*  And yet that's what they're doing. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=473.6s)]
*  Now the DOJ, in case you haven't noticed, has decided that the January 6th protesters [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  are the real terrorists. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=479.24s)]
*  They're the insurrectionists you keep hearing about. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=480.76000000000005s)]
*  And yet, weirdly, as of just two days ago, not one American citizen had actually been [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  charged by the federal government with insurrecting. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=488.48s)]
*  Watch them admit that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=491.36s)]
*  Has anyone been charged with the crime of insurrection following January 6th? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=493.32000000000005s)]
*  I am not aware that anyone has been charged with that particular offense, even if it is [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=500.76s)]
*  an offense. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=507.76s)]
*  I just am not aware of that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=508.76s)]
*  Oops. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=510.76s)]
*  They can actually be insurrectionists if no one has committed insurrection. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=511.76s)]
*  That's pretty embarrassing. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=516.76s)]
*  Apparently the DOJ finally realized how embarrassing it was. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=517.76s)]
*  So about 48 hours after the testimony you just saw, and more than a year after January [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=520.76s)]
*  6th, today the feds announced that they will charge someone with sedition after all. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=527.56s)]
*  Now if you've got any questions about the timing of these charges or the merit of the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=534.56s)]
*  sedition case the DOJ just announced, the Biden administration would like to remind [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=538.56s)]
*  you to keep those questions to yourself. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=542.56s)]
*  And just to make sure that you do keep them to yourself or are unable to share them with [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=545.56s)]
*  anyone else, today Joe Biden also announced a crackdown on the news media. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=548.56s)]
*  As he put it, a crackdown on anyone who spreads quote, disinformation and misinformation [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=554.3599999999999s)]
*  about his government. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=559.3599999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=561.3599999999999s)]
*  If you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=562.3599999999999s)]
*  Personal choice impacts us all. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=566.3599999999999s)]
*  Our hospitals, our countries. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=569.3599999999999s)]
*  I make a special appeal to social media companies and media outlets. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=571.3599999999999s)]
*  Please deal with the misinformation and disinformation that's on your shows. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=576.3599999999999s)]
*  It has to stop. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=582.16s)]
*  The misinformation that's on your shows. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=584.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=587.16s)]
*  Message received. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=588.16s)]
*  It has to stop, Joe Biden says. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=589.16s)]
*  So that means that big tech and media organizations have to do what he says. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=592.16s)]
*  Just like his Vax mandate, found unconstitutional today by the way. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=596.16s)]
*  It'll still be enforced because big businesses rely on the government to exist. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=600.16s)]
*  They take government money, they are regulated from the very top to the very bottom by the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=606.16s)]
*  government. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=610.16s)]
*  It takes a lot to defy the President of the United States. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  If he tells you to do something, you'd better do it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=613.9599999999999s)]
*  What Joe Biden is telling media companies to do today is to censor their content so [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=615.9599999999999s)]
*  it doesn't contradict his decrees. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  Now CNN has no problem with this. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  In fact, they made fun of what Joe Biden said today. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  They made fun of his call for censorship. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  Not because it's obviously unconstitutional, which it is, but because it wasn't quite [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  fascist enough. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  One of those weird looking media reporters over at CNN wrote this, quote, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=637.76s)]
*  So they understand exactly what's going on here. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=646.76s)]
*  Joe Biden is targeting Fox News for censorship. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=648.76s)]
*  His call for censorship, by the way, comes after hundreds of doctors and scientists [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=651.76s)]
*  called on Spotify to adopt a misinformation policy that would shut down Joe Rogan's podcast. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=656.76s)]
*  Rogan recovered from COVID without the Vax and they hate him for it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=661.76s)]
*  So it's not just the government, of course, it's people acting on behalf of the government [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=666.56s)]
*  calling for the same thing, which is censorship of political opinions. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=671.56s)]
*  What you're seeing here is dangerous. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=676.56s)]
*  There's no other way to describe it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=678.56s)]
*  Far more dangerous than domestic terror threat they've been bloviating about for the last [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=679.56s)]
*  three days. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=683.56s)]
*  It contravenes the First Amendment. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=684.56s)]
*  Under the First Amendment, the government cannot coordinate with private actors to censor [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=685.56s)]
*  free speech. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=689.56s)]
*  Period. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=690.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court has made that very clear over centuries. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=691.56s)]
*  And yet that's exactly what's happening. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=695.3599999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden did it today. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=697.3599999999999s)]
*  Care to complain about that? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=698.3599999999999s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=700.3599999999999s)]
*  You may have noticed what happens to people who complain too much. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=701.3599999999999s)]
*  Roger Stone, for example, complained an awful lot about the government. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=703.8599999999999s)]
*  He did it loudly, often. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=706.8599999999999s)]
*  He did it for years. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=708.3599999999999s)]
*  And the DOJ didn't like it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=709.3599999999999s)]
*  So in the end, they accused Roger Stone on the basis of zero evidence whatsoever of colluding [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=711.06s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  In the end, they charged him with lying to Congress, something that happens literally [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=717.28s)]
*  every day of the year. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=720.8599999999999s)]
*  But in his case, they made it a felony, threatened to send him to prison for the rest of his [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=722.5s)]
*  life. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=725.5s)]
*  But in the meantime, they sent a helicopter, a boat, and armed paramilitaries to his home [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=726.5s)]
*  at dawn after coordinating the raid with CNN. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=731.1s)]
*  Really one of the darkest moments in civil liberties in recent history. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=734.7s)]
*  We still have the tape. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=739.18s)]
*  Let's watch it again. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=740.18s)]
*  Exclusive footage you're looking at right now from CNN as the FBI arrives at Roger [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=741.7s)]
*  Stone's residence in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, taking him into custody. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=748.66s)]
*  They arrived before dawn there, before 6 a.m., or just after 6 a.m., a dozen officers were [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=754.3399999999999s)]
*  told. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=760.18s)]
*  So they coordinate with CNN just to make sure it's all preserved on tape, to send the message [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=765.4599999999999s)]
*  to everybody else for the encouragement of the others, as the French used to say. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=771.3s)]
*  And then they send guys with automatic weapons to your house to shut you up, to destroy you. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=775.66s)]
*  Now the people who ordered that raid should have been brought up on charges themselves. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=781.06s)]
*  But they weren't. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=785.2199999999999s)]
*  They're promoted. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=786.2199999999999s)]
*  And now thanks to Joe Biden, they have more power to harass their political enemies. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=787.2199999999999s)]
*  Do you feel safer? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5Bb3Mt0rg&t=791.42s)]
