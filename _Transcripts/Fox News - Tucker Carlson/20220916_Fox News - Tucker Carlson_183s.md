# Marjorie Taylor Greene: China is 'our number one threat'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k)
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene is, however, she's a member of Congress from Georgia and we're happy to have her join us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. Selling off one of America's most valuable assets to China, a company to add insult to injury that his son was invested in. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=4.72s)]
*  Why is no one saying anything about this? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=15.0s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure, Tucker. I think it is absolutely outrageous and so do the American people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=18.88s)]
*  The one role that is most important for the president of the United States is to protect our country's national security. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=24.2s)]
*  Our strategic petroleum reserves are just that. Our national security when it comes to oil, the very important resource that we have that fuels our economy, helps us drive our cars and petroleum also feeds over 6000 products. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=31.4s)]
*  Things Americans rely on every single day, but Joe Biden has been selling off a million barrels of oil every single day and we're down to 434 million barrels of oil. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=47.72s)]
*  America consumes just around 19 million barrels of oil per day. We cannot. We cannot sustain this. It is putting us in danger. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=57.959999999999994s)]
*  And by our tracking, he has sold over 7 million barrels of oil to China. China, our number one threat that wants to conquer us, wants to become the number one superpower in the world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=66.64s)]
*  And because of that, Tucker, it is imperative that when Republicans take back Congress that we have to hold hold Joe Biden accountable for this because he's planning on selling more oil out of our strategic petroleum petroleum reserves again, starting in October. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=78.44000000000001s)]
*  So I'm introducing articles of impeachment against Joe Biden on Monday because of this outrageous move that he has continued to make and putting our entire country in danger. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  So he's doing it now or in September next month is October. The month after that, if I'm if I'm following it correctly, would be November, the first Tuesday in which is his pivotal midterm election. So he's doing this for political reasons. Keep gas prices low before people vote. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=106.88s)]
*  Absolutely. Our strategic petroleum reserves are not meant to lower gas prices for November elections. They're meant to be a national security emergency supply for all Americans. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=122.0s)]
*  But Joe Biden is abusing it and he's putting our entire country in danger. And because of that, we're not going to have any more oil left. He's selling it to our enemies and foreign countries all over the world. Joe Biden has to be impeached and we must do it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=134.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's and it's not his. I know this guy has lived at public expense for his entire adult life, but he doesn't own that. It belongs to the public and he can't just sell it to China. It's just too it's just too crazy to continue. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=148.12s)]
*  Well, I appreciate those business partners. Well, you're that's business partners for sure. Yes. Marjorie Taylor Green of Georgia joining us tonight. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=161.2s)]
*  Stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=177.6s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlLH3jEZ2k&t=181.2s)]
