# Fired Marine tells Tucker why he challenged leadership over Afghanistan
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY)
*  Stu Scheller spent 17 years as United States Marine Corps officer, five combat deployments [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=0.0s)]
*  in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=8.36s)]
*  To this day, Scheller remains the only person in the United States punished in any way for [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=9.84s)]
*  the debacle of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=15.4s)]
*  He criticized it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=18.44s)]
*  They sent him to jail for it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=19.96s)]
*  We sat down for his first interview since leaving jail, and it was fascinating. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=22.06s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=26.6s)]
*  So this had been building up for a while. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=28.48s)]
*  So anyone that has been there and experienced it, it's very personal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=35.36s)]
*  And so in the age that we lived, I was watching the Afghanistan plan fall apart before our [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=40.24s)]
*  eyes, social media, real time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=46.36s)]
*  It was very frustrating. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=48.16s)]
*  And I was talking to my family, I was talking to my friends, I was having a real hard time [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=49.16s)]
*  with it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=52.28s)]
*  And then about a week previous to it, the commandant of the Marine Corps released a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=53.68s)]
*  white letter that stated, you know, was your sacrifices worth it, addressing all of us [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=57.44s)]
*  struggling with what we were struggling with. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=62.28s)]
*  And he stated, if you are having trouble, you need to go seek therapy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=64.36s)]
*  But he never pointed out that anyone, any senior leader might be culpable for wrongdoings. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=68.8s)]
*  And I saw that as him placing his loyalty to the other general officers and not to the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=75.2s)]
*  junior enlisted. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=79.0s)]
*  We could have all avoided the trip to the therapist had he admitted that senior leaders [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=80.68s)]
*  had fault. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=84.68s)]
*  So I was angry about that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=85.68s)]
*  I was angry about how it was handled. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=86.68s)]
*  And then a week later, the unit that got attacked was my first unit. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=89.32s)]
*  When I was in Ramadi, my best friend got hit with an S-vest in 1-8. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=93.12s)]
*  It came full circle to me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=96.8s)]
*  I was the regimental operations officer that put 1-8 out on deployment. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=98.12s)]
*  I knew all the company commanders. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=102.68s)]
*  I knew the battalion XO. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=103.68s)]
*  I knew the ops. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=104.68s)]
*  I intimately knew this unit. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=105.68s)]
*  Since then, I had moved on to become a battalion commander. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=107.6s)]
*  And all of this just got to a point where I knew for a fact that no senior leaders were [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=110.6s)]
*  going to be held accountable. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  I knew that I was going to be held accountable. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  But at a certain point, we need to publicly address our shortfalls or we're going to keep [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=120.0s)]
*  repeating the same mistakes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=124.0s)]
*  And so even after I made that video, I made the video in my office. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=125.28s)]
*  I didn't post it right away. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=129.84s)]
*  I drove to my house. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=131.0s)]
*  And you're outside your house. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=132.96s)]
*  You got your wife and your three kids inside the house. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=133.96s)]
*  And I'm pacing around the front of the house on my phone, like the button away, knowing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=136.96s)]
*  that that's going to change your life forever. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  And I made the decision to put that out there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=145.8s)]
*  But why? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, everything you said, I think everyone understands your frustrations. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  But you're clearly smart. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  So you sort of knew maybe you could go to jail for it, but you knew. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=157.12s)]
*  But you did it anyway. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=162.08s)]
*  So why did you do that? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=163.08s)]
*  This has been my whole life. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=165.88s)]
*  My whole adult life has been dedicated to America, foreign diplomacy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=167.84s)]
*  I wrote a master's thesis on how to make foreign diplomacy more effective. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=173.0s)]
*  There's no one more personally invested than me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=178.88s)]
*  I've awards for valor. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=181.24s)]
*  But all that's irrelevant when I'm watching the junior service member win every tactical [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=184.44s)]
*  engagement in the future that our general officers right now are talking about. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=192.6s)]
*  The shift of the force, the national security strategy, it's all predicated on changes on [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  the tactical level, how to mature the force, distributed operations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=201.0s)]
*  That's all tactical level stuff. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  We've won every tactical level engagement. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=205.72s)]
*  What we're losing at is the operational level where General McKenzie and the combatant commanders [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=207.84s)]
*  reside and that link between the strategic level and the National Security Council, the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=212.2s)]
*  Secretary of Defense and the president. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Those are the people that need to be addressed and be held accountable because these are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  the people that are junior enlisted, are going out there sacrificing everything. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=221.56s)]
*  I would submit sacrificing more than the general officers are and they're not getting the credit [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=225.04s)]
*  they deserve. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=228.56s)]
*  And so you ask me why I did it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  And those are the men you command. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=231.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=233.32s)]
*  I was a company commander in multiple different commands. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=234.32s)]
*  I've been a company commander at the School of Infantry. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=237.4s)]
*  I was a company commander in 3-2, a weapons company commander and a headquarters company [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=239.0s)]
*  commander. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=242.24s)]
*  I was a company commander at the basic school for a bunch of officers. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=243.24s)]
*  So cumulatively I've been a company commander for five years. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  I had been selected to battalion command. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=247.76s)]
*  I was in my battalion command seat for about two months before I made that video. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=249.24s)]
*  So it was pretty short lived and they fired me before dinner the next night. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=253.88s)]
*  But I did it because not only was I personally invested, following Vietnam, there was no [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  general officers that were held accountable. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=267.44s)]
*  And the narrative that's told today is how the general officers had to basically clean [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=269.32s)]
*  up the draft generation and make good service members. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  And the exact same thing is happening right now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=277.48s)]
*  They're taking, hey, the G-Wat generation doesn't know how to fight China. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=281.48s)]
*  We need to change it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=284.12s)]
*  It's the tactical problems. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=285.12s)]
*  And they're not focusing on the operational and strategic problems, which are the same [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=286.38s)]
*  things that should have been addressed after Vietnam and we're not. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=289.44s)]
*  And the reason they kind of got washed away is because we had a marginal success in Desert [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  Storm in the 90s. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=296.36s)]
*  And that just kind of threw us off in terms of the systemic changes that need to take [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  place. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  All of those reasons are why I felt like, you know, it's not my place to say it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=304.4s)]
*  And everyone pointed that out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  But there's nobody else saying it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, there's just nobody else saying it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=313.52s)]
*  Stu Scheller, a really brave man and an honorable man. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=317.64s)]
*  Exactly the sort of person you want defending your country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQizj2kGfHY&t=321.52s)]
