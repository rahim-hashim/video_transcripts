# LA Sheriff warns vaccine mandates will impact public safety
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ)
*  Los Angeles County is one of the biggest counties in the world, actually. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Alex Villanueva is the sheriff of LA County. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=3.84s)]
*  He has pledged not to enforce these mandates because he doesn't want citizens to die. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=6.48s)]
*  The sheriff joins us tonight. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=11.48s)]
*  Sheriff, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=13.56s)]
*  So we talked to you some time ago and you had this position. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=15.92s)]
*  I know you've taken a lot of heat for it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Tell us why you maintain this position and what you think could happen if you were to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=21.88s)]
*  cave on this question. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=25.62s)]
*  Well, the results are very obvious. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=28.8s)]
*  For example, I have a 20 percent increase in people that are putting into retire early. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=31.0s)]
*  That's over 100 people right there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=36.56s)]
*  Another 300 plus are filing workers' compensation claims. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=38.28s)]
*  That's a 22 percent increase. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=42.08s)]
*  I have 238 deputies now applying for out-of-county jobs that do not have vaccine mandates. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=44.32s)]
*  And I have 1,600 potential people that have 28 years or more of service. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=50.58s)]
*  They could just walk away and not lose a penny and not even look back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=54.84s)]
*  And that is a huge threat to the departments already severely understaffed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=59.32000000000001s)]
*  But the board of supervisors is just, they don't care apparently. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=63.28s)]
*  So I've heard people say, well, you know, you lose a third of your firemen or 40 percent [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=67.84s)]
*  of your cops. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  Just like hire new people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  Just, you know, bring in, I don't know, temp workers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  Are you comfortable handing out firearms and badges to people with no experience? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  It takes me almost a year and a half to replace an entry-level worker, to replace a veteran [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=84.2s)]
*  30-year expert in whatever capacity. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=90.64s)]
*  For example, a homicide investigator. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=95.0s)]
*  Those are decades that it takes to replace someone like that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=96.0s)]
*  And you cannot quantify the impact that has on public safety. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=99.12s)]
*  But guarantee you, homicides will go up. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=103.08s)]
*  A lot of things are going to go up. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=105.4s)]
*  And response time is going to get longer and longer. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=106.68s)]
*  Your priorities are so exactly in the right place. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=109.78s)]
*  I just have to ask you, are people thanking you for taking a stand on this? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=111.68s)]
*  Well, I've got a lot of people that are thanking me from across the political spectrum, except [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  for one group. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=121.72000000000001s)]
*  The woke left somehow embraced this idea like it's another cultural war to fight, a mandate. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=123.0s)]
*  But where is all the data that supports mandates? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  They're not looking at hard science and hard data. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=131.68s)]
*  They're going with, well, it feels good to have a mandate. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=134.38s)]
*  Man, why didn't you run for governor? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=138.0s)]
*  Sheriff, I appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=141.64s)]
*  Sorry to embarrass you with that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=143.44s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=144.84s)]
*  Godspeed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYXqCEeauQ&t=145.84s)]
