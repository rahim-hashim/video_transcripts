# Biden African travel ban built on a lie: Journalist
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM)
*  Yesterday's White House press briefing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=0.0s)]
*  Jen Psaki claimed that there are [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=2.0s)]
*  potentially thousands of new [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=4.28s)]
*  COVID cases in South Africa. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=5.84s)]
*  Therefore, she said a travel ban [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=7.68s)]
*  against several countries in Southern [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=9.84s)]
*  Africa will remain in effect. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=11.76s)]
*  One reporter from Africa was in the room. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=13.76s)]
*  He wasn't buying it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=16.68s)]
*  Objective is I have to wrap [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=18.16s)]
*  this up in a minute, but Patsy, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  go ahead, Patsy, go ahead, go ahead. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=22.36s)]
*  Following up, following up. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=24.8s)]
*  Let let Patsy I just answered. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=26.52s)]
*  Simon, I answered a question on this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=30.8s)]
*  Let's let's Patsy Simon Simon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=32.52s)]
*  I answered a question on this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  Let's let Patsy ask a question. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=38.04s)]
*  It's not effective to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=41.36s)]
*  scream over your colleagues in here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=42.36s)]
*  Let's let Patsy ask a question. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=43.68s)]
*  Simon Atiba is the man [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=47.0s)]
*  you just saw in that clip. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  He's the White House correspondent [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=49.8s)]
*  for Today News Africa, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=51.24s)]
*  and he joins us now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=53.28s)]
*  So Simon, do you think you were being [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=54.96s)]
*  disrespected by the Biden White House? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=56.36s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Jesse, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=61.0s)]
*  and I'm so glad to be here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=63.0s)]
*  And I thought Fox News were full of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=65.12s)]
*  racist and hate black and hate Africans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  But here you have me, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=71.64s)]
*  someone who was born in Africa [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=73.4s)]
*  and covers the White House for [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=75.12s)]
*  for Today News Africa. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=77.76s)]
*  I think that the travel ban [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=79.92s)]
*  was based on a lie. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=81.28s)]
*  The president on November 26 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  banned eight African countries. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=85.72s)]
*  Only two of those countries [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=88.92s)]
*  had any case of Omicron variant. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=91.04s)]
*  Six of the other countries [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=95.0s)]
*  had zero case of the variant. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=96.92s)]
*  And let me give you an example of Namibia, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  one of the countries the president banned. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  It's a small country in Southern Africa, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  2.5 million people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=108.76s)]
*  In two years, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  they've had only 400 cases of COVID-19 [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=112.12s)]
*  in the entire country, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=115.68s)]
*  and they have zero case, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  zero case of the Omicron variant. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=119.36s)]
*  Yet the president banned them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=122.04s)]
*  And right now there's total chaos [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  because people can't travel to Namibia, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=126.64s)]
*  people can't travel to Zimbabwe, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=128.96s)]
*  people can't travel to Mozambique, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=131.68s)]
*  yet they have zero case. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=133.56s)]
*  So I believe that I wasn't the one [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=135.52s)]
*  who was disrespected. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=137.28s)]
*  I think Africa was disrespected [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=138.56s)]
*  by banning countries based on a lie. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=141.2s)]
*  So the Biden people say [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=145.28s)]
*  the scientists told Biden [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=148.48s)]
*  to slap the travel ban [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=150.48s)]
*  on these Southern African countries, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=151.84s)]
*  and he's just doing what the scientists want him to do. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Are you buying that? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=157.92s)]
*  Or do you think there's something more? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  No, it's a total lie. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=160.56s)]
*  The way people see it in Africa, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=164.0s)]
*  the scientists, I spoke to the WHO [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=166.12s)]
*  before coming here, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=168.8s)]
*  and I've attended all the press briefing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  of the WHO in the past two years, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  and I've asked more questions [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  at the WHO press briefing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=176.6s)]
*  than any reporters in the world. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=178.32s)]
*  And the WHO believe that the travel ban [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=180.92s)]
*  don't prevent variant. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=184.04s)]
*  The Gavi told me travel ban [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  don't prevent variant from spreading. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=190.32s)]
*  Africa CDC told me travel ban [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=193.72s)]
*  don't prevent variant from spreading. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=197.84s)]
*  So I believe that it was a very ill-thought idea, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  and I believe that any scientist who says [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=205.16000000000003s)]
*  you should ban countries that have zero variant [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  and allow countries that have variants [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=211.28s)]
*  to come to the U.S., [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  I believe it is a bad advice, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=216.0s)]
*  and I think that it seems discriminatory, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=220.52s)]
*  and it almost seems a bit racist, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=223.84s)]
*  because all those countries, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=225.72000000000003s)]
*  all the eight countries, black African countries. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=227.28s)]
*  Can you imagine if the former president, Donald Trump, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  and I'm not his fan, I disagree with his tweet, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  I disagree with 150%, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=236.96s)]
*  but can you imagine if he had banned eight African countries [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=239.4s)]
*  and those countries, six of those countries [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=244.4s)]
*  have zero case of the variant, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=246.96s)]
*  there would have been an uprising, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=250.88s)]
*  do we ban him a racist, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  someone who hates black and hates Africa, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=254.6s)]
*  and yet we are seeing it in this administration. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=257.6s)]
*  So I believe that Africa has been disrespected, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  and I believe that the travel ban [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=263.92s)]
*  do not really make sense. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=266.52s)]
*  Any scientist who says that you should ban a country [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=268.28s)]
*  that has zero case and has had 400 cases of COVID-19 [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=271.6s)]
*  in two years, and not ban the UK that had 22 cases, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=277.0s)]
*  and I had hundreds of thousands of people dying [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=281.92s)]
*  in the past two years, that cannot be good science. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=284.92s)]
*  Well, the theoretical situation that you just mentioned, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=290.48s)]
*  if Donald Trump had done that, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=293.88s)]
*  he would have been scorched as a racist, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=295.16s)]
*  shows me that you, Simon, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  know more about how this country works [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  than a lot of the people in this country do. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for coming on Fox News, you're always welcome. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NFPm-cnWM&t=308.32s)]
