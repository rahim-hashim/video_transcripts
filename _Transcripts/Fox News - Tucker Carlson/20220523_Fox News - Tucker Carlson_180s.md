# Stacey Abrams made a ‘gaffe of a faux pas’: Civil rights attorney
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw)
*  State of Georgia has been pretty good to our friend Stacey Abrams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=0.0s)]
*  Not clear what Abrams does for a living, and yet somehow she has been able to afford two [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  homes in the state of Georgia. But she's not grateful for it. Over the weekend, Abrams, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=8.8s)]
*  who was apparently running for office again despite being the real governor of Georgia, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=12.56s)]
*  went out of her way to attack the state she hopes to lead. Watch. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=16.88s)]
*  I am tired of hearing about being the best state in the country to do business when we are the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=21.68s)]
*  worst state in the country to live. Well, there's a campaign tactic you don't see very often. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=25.76s)]
*  I hate this place. Elect me. Robert Patio, it's a radio talk show host in Atlanta. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=34.32s)]
*  He's a statewide Democratic party strategist and a regional director for the Rainbow Push Coalition. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=40.88s)]
*  He joins us tonight. Robert, thanks so much for coming on. So you don't often hear people seeking [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=45.52s)]
*  to lead a state attack the state. What do you think that was about? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=51.52s)]
*  Well, I think it was a gaffe. It was a faux pas. This is what happens often when you have a [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  campaign where most of your fundraisers are coming out of California. Most of your talking [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=59.36s)]
*  points and political strategists are coming out of New York and D.C. And the same things that work [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  in D.C. aren't going to work in Dakota, Georgia. You have to get out there and actually talk to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=67.12s)]
*  people in the grassroots. You have to talk to some of the political strategists and political [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=70.64s)]
*  consultants who are right here in the state. And then you have people like D.Doc and Tagler, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=75.44s)]
*  who's running for secretary of state, who's been to all 159 counties and talks to people on a daily [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=79.04s)]
*  basis. You have to dig down and make sure that you are reflecting the views of the people of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=83.68s)]
*  your state, not simply people who are putting money into the campaign. Well, that seems like [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  a theme here. So if you look at the polling and what voters care about, surprise, surprise, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=91.84s)]
*  it's not global warming. It's not Ukraine. It's inflation, gas prices and the economy. Those are [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  the top three. So if your campaign has really run out of the west side of Los Angeles, how can you [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=102.56s)]
*  be in touch with those issues, I wonder? Well, I think a big part of it is going to have to be [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=108.4s)]
*  going on a listening tour around the state, making sure you're talking to people in small diners and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  local communities. And I'm from down in Harris County, Georgia. So we view things a little bit [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=117.28s)]
*  differently. We see people from Atlanta as being outsiders, so do people from outside the state or [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  outside the region. So I think you have to start working with some of those regional people, people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=126.48s)]
*  like Keith McCants in Middle Georgia, Scout Smith, who's a great political consultant there in the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=130.16s)]
*  state, John Jetson, who's a veteran who can connect you to those communities. When you start [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=134.4s)]
*  actually listening to the voters instead of listening to the consultants, that's when you're [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=138.8s)]
*  able to win a race. And particularly when you have a fractured Republican Party like we have in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  state of Georgia right now, where you have David Perdue attacking Brian Kent for not being Republican [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=146.16s)]
*  enough. I think that you have an opportunity to really build that grassroots support while they're [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=151.36s)]
*  having a civil war on the other side. Yeah. I mean, it seems like you couldn't run a party worse than [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=155.52s)]
*  the state of Georgia's run its Republican Party. So Robert, appreciate your thoughts on that. Thank [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=160.8s)]
*  you very much. Thanks. Anytime. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm8QVyYGcw&t=165.92000000000002s)]
