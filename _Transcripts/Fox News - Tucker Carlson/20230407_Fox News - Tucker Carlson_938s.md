# Tucker Carlson: Transgenderism is America's fastest-growing religion
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k)
*  Good evening and welcome to a special edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Good Friday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=4.4s)]
*  This is the saddest and at the same time by far the most hopeful day on the Christian [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=6.24s)]
*  calendar. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=10.28s)]
*  There was a time not so long ago when the overwhelming majority of Americans observed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=11.28s)]
*  Good Friday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=14.96s)]
*  They got up, they went to church, they talked about it at the office and at dinner that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=15.96s)]
*  night. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=18.84s)]
*  It was part of their culture. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=19.84s)]
*  That's no longer true. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=20.84s)]
*  Tonight, you wonder how many Americans even know it's Good Friday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  So after hundreds of years, this has finally become a non-Christian country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=25.78s)]
*  But it's not a secular country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=29.92s)]
*  You sometimes hear people call it that, but they are wrong. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  There are no secular countries. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=34.22s)]
*  Every country has a religion because every person has a religion, even if it's atheism. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  Everybody worships something. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=42.96s)]
*  We're born that way. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  We can't get away from it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  So what is America's religion now? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=46.72s)]
*  Well, as it happens, we have video. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=48.56s)]
*  This is from St. Mark's Lutheran Church in Fargo, North Dakota. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  It was taken on April 2nd. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=54.84s)]
*  That was the first Sunday after the mass killing in Nashville in which three adults [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=57.24s)]
*  and three children were murdered at a Christian school for being Christians. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  In the old America, Christian pastors would have preached about this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=66.04s)]
*  They would have acknowledged the evil on display and they would have prayed for those who'd [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=69.8s)]
*  been killed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  A form of that is still happening today, but the roles have been inverted. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=74.8s)]
*  In America's new religion, the victims are not the children who died in Nashville. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=79.26s)]
*  The victim is the woman who killed them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=83.34s)]
*  As Audrey Hale called herself transgender, she was by definition a holy martyr. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=86.26s)]
*  Watch this pastor in a formerly Christian church compare Audrey Hale to Jesus. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  Leaders were looking for any excuse, valid or not, to crucify Jesus. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=100.54s)]
*  And they found that reason. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=109.44s)]
*  It's baffling to me that someone's existence can be so threatening that people decide they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=111.24s)]
*  need to be controlled, that they need to have laws made against them, or even worse, that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  the people that they find to be so threatening should die. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  So Audrey Hale's very existence as a transgender person was so threatening to authorities that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=133.42s)]
*  they killed her just as the Pharisees killed Jesus. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=139.7s)]
*  Her death had nothing to do with the fact she just murdered six people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=144.32s)]
*  That was the pastor's sermon at St. Mark's in Fargo. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=149.1s)]
*  So it's pretty clear that St. Mark's Lutheran Church is no longer a Christian church. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=153.42s)]
*  So what is it now? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=157.2s)]
*  Well, it's a transgenderist church, one of many. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=158.2s)]
*  Transgenderism is this country's priestess growing religion. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=162.5s)]
*  Like many faiths, its theology features a supernatural transfiguration, the moment a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=165.14s)]
*  person is transmogrified from one sex to another. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  Converts to this faith abandon their old lives and embrace an entirely new sex. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  Former identities no longer exist. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  They're dead names. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=180.82s)]
*  But here's one big difference. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=183.42s)]
*  Transgenderists do not believe in the god of monotheism. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=186.44s)]
*  They believe that they themselves are god with the power to control nature. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=189.44s)]
*  And if you think about it, this should be a concern because it's a recipe for extremism. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=194.54s)]
*  People who believe that they're god tend to react very badly when told that they're not. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=200.42s)]
*  So if you were running the government and you wanted to prevent violence in your own [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  country, you would be very concerned about the growth of a cult like this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=209.34s)]
*  But the Biden administration is not concerned at all. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=215.0s)]
*  In fact, it is cheering this cult on. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=217.1s)]
*  Watch Joe Biden's spokeswoman just days after the massacre of children in Nashville explain [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=220.62s)]
*  that when transgenderists quote, fight back, she approves. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=226.22s)]
*  Fourteen states have now banned gender affirming health care while some of these laws are currently [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=231.22000000000003s)]
*  blocked by courts. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=237.56s)]
*  This is a dangerous, a dangerous attack. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=239.5s)]
*  This is awful news. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=243.08s)]
*  We need to be very clear about that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=244.08s)]
*  LGBTQI plus kids are resilient. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=246.58s)]
*  They are fierce. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  They fight back. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=253.24s)]
*  They're not going anywhere. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=254.66000000000003s)]
*  And we have their back. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=257.46000000000004s)]
*  This administration has their back. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=259.18s)]
*  They are fierce. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=263.26s)]
*  They fight back. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=264.68s)]
*  This administration has had back. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  So this is coming on the heels just days after a massacre in which children were murdered, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=269.36s)]
*  apparently in response to laws against and surgical castration of children. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=275.74s)]
*  So the White House is not decrying that the White House is endorsing it as clearly as [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=282.58s)]
*  it possibly could. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=286.54s)]
*  And that's why no one from the Biden White House is visiting the grieving Christian families [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=287.54s)]
*  in Nashville. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=290.68s)]
*  Instead, today, Kamala Harris went to Nashville to promote three Democratic Party legislators [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=291.68s)]
*  who led a riot at the State House, a riot designed to promote, yes, the cult of transgenderism. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=297.16s)]
*  So consider the message here. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=303.82s)]
*  We're on your side. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=306.02s)]
*  And not only we're on your side, you, the mentally ill who may be armed, are the victims. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=307.73999999999995s)]
*  And you are being genocided. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  Your very existence is at stake. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=316.38s)]
*  In other words, making paranoid people on the edge more paranoid. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=318.41999999999996s)]
*  So fight back. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=323.26s)]
*  You are fierce. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=324.26s)]
*  This is not the message to give to religious nuts with weapons, and particularly not this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  group of religious nuts with weapons. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=332.18s)]
*  This is a group that has for years been committing acts of violence at rates much higher than [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  you would expect across a cross section of the population. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=339.74s)]
*  To give a few examples, last year a trans girl tried to assassinate a sexist justice, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=343.98s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh, at his home. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  Then he self-described not binary shooter, also a member of the cult, murdered five people [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=351.06s)]
*  at a Colorado nightclub. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=354.98s)]
*  In 2019, a trans teenager shot nine people in a high school, killing one. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=357.62s)]
*  That was in Denver. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=362.22s)]
*  In 2018, a mentally ill transgenderist shot up a right-aid distribution center in Aberdeen, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=363.22s)]
*  Maryland. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=368.7s)]
*  That massacre killed four. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=369.7s)]
*  So you can see where this is going, and you shouldn't be surprised by it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=370.94s)]
*  Mental illness leads to violence. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=375.7s)]
*  This is a species of mental illness, and there's no mental illness greater than the delusion [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=377.5s)]
*  that you are God. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=381.8s)]
*  And that's exactly what this cult teaches its adherents. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=383.62s)]
*  You are God. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=387.82s)]
*  You can change nature with your will. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=388.82s)]
*  Change biology. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=390.82s)]
*  Now with the endorsement of the Biden administration, the terrorism that is the inevitable result [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=394.82s)]
*  of this belief system is accelerating. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=399.06s)]
*  Police just arrested a man called William Whitworth. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=401.7s)]
*  He's a transgenderist, uses the name of Lily, in the state of Colorado. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  Apparently he had a kill list and a manifesto. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=408.66s)]
*  He was planning to attack three schools and churches, and apparently some talk show hosts [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=411.5s)]
*  So it would be nice to see this manifesto or the kill list, but of course you can't [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=416.82s)]
*  see it because the authorities are, as they have in Nashville, hiding it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=421.82s)]
*  Now why are they hiding it? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=426.54s)]
*  Because they have to. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=428.54s)]
*  When your religious views violate the unyielding laws of nature itself, you have no choice [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=430.04s)]
*  but to hide things. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=436.22s)]
*  You have to. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=437.62s)]
*  Deception is mandatory, and it will soon be reflected in the law. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=438.78s)]
*  That is already happening in Canada, which is in some sense the new California. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=444.06s)]
*  If you want to know our future, look north, not west. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=447.06s)]
*  In Canada, transgenderism will soon be the justification for suspending all freedom of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=450.62s)]
*  speech. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=456.42s)]
*  A new law will ban speech that offends transgenderists near drag performances. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=457.42s)]
*  So you can't complain. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=462.58s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=464.82s)]
*  The drag communities are done waiting for this government to take real action in effective [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=466.54s)]
*  ways, and so is the Ontario NDP. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=472.9s)]
*  The proposed legislation does two things, and I will go through them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  Firstly, it enables the Attorney General to create a 2SLGBT-QI Plus Community Safety Zone [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=479.9s)]
*  to prohibit within 100 metres of the property any homophobic, transphobic act of intimidation, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=487.42s)]
*  threat, offensive threats, offensive remarks, protest, disturbance, and distribution of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=494.41999999999996s)]
*  hate propaganda within the meaning of the criminal code. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=499.54s)]
*  It also comes with it a penalty of $25,000 if prosecuted successfully. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=503.70000000000005s)]
*  So here's a rule of thumb that is worth tacking on your refrigerator because it explains so [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=511.38s)]
*  much. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=515.14s)]
*  If the people who claim to be victims are working to oppress you, they're not actually [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=516.14s)]
*  victims. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=522.38s)]
*  They are oppressors. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=523.38s)]
*  And once again, with this cult specifically, that is inevitable because at its core is [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=526.54s)]
*  a provable lie, defied and revealed by the unchanging laws of science. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=532.74s)]
*  We do not have the power to change our sex. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=539.8s)]
*  It is in our DNA. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=542.74s)]
*  It is in our bone structure. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=543.74s)]
*  You dig up a fossilized skeleton thousands of years later and you can tell it's sex. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=545.4599999999999s)]
*  We can't change that much as we might want to, much as we might feel deep sympathy for [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=551.28s)]
*  those who want to. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=555.42s)]
*  We still can't change it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=556.54s)]
*  That is true. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=559.14s)]
*  And so of course they have to criminalize your observing that it's true because that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=561.74s)]
*  is a challenge to the core of their faith. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=566.7s)]
*  These are religious extremists on a jihad against the population. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=569.1s)]
*  In order to win, they have to force everyone to lie, period. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=573.5s)]
*  But there are always a few who refuse no matter what to lie. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=579.14s)]
*  And one of those is Riley Gaines. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=582.42s)]
*  So last year, Riley Gaines was a collegiate swimmer at the University of Kentucky. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=584.34s)]
*  During an NCAA championship, she and her teammates were forced to compete against a man called [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=588.7s)]
*  William Thomas. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=593.22s)]
*  Now, there's been a lot of news coverage of William Thomas, but here's the truth. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=594.22s)]
*  Thomas had been a male swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania and he had a lackluster swimming [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=599.22s)]
*  career. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=602.86s)]
*  So he came up with a plan. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=603.86s)]
*  He decided to give himself a female name. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=604.86s)]
*  And soon he started winning women's swimming competitions. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=607.26s)]
*  So what do you call that? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=612.14s)]
*  You call it cheating. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=613.14s)]
*  That's cheating. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=614.78s)]
*  And Thomas's cheating was not a secret. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=615.86s)]
*  It was obvious to everybody. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=617.06s)]
*  But only Riley Gaines was brave enough to say something about it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  She came on our show last July. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=623.14s)]
*  That night we watched Leah Thomas win a national title and blow all the other females completely [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=626.54s)]
*  out of the water. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=631.1s)]
*  And that next day we came back and the mood had shifted to where people were mad. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=633.02s)]
*  The girls, you know, there were tears. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=638.26s)]
*  These poor 9th and 17th place finishers who missed out on being named an All-American. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=640.9s)]
*  There's extreme discomfort in the locker room. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=646.02s)]
*  There's, you know, kind of these grumbles of... [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=648.22s)]
*  Is he wandering around the women's locker room? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=651.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=653.62s)]
*  And that's not something, you know, we were forewarned about, which I don't think is right [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=654.62s)]
*  in any means. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=658.9399999999999s)]
*  Changing in a locker room with someone who has different parts. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=661.02s)]
*  So you can probably tell just from that clip that Riley Gaines is not an ideologue. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=666.78s)]
*  She was not a political activist. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=670.42s)]
*  She was a college swimmer and assumed that she would be just that, a college swimmer. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=671.42s)]
*  But she was forced into a place where she had no choice but to tell the truth. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=676.26s)]
*  She was not going to violate her own conscience. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=680.78s)]
*  The story she told was almost hard to believe in a supposedly rational country, but it was [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=683.5s)]
*  real. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=687.14s)]
*  And because nobody else had the courage to stop this trend before it accelerated, similar [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=688.46s)]
*  things began to happen all over American sports and with predictable results. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=692.5s)]
*  In November, the National Hockey League sponsored an all trans draft tournament. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=697.78s)]
*  A male cross dresser was allowed to compete against women. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=702.22s)]
*  What do you think happened? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=704.54s)]
*  Well, during the game, the man lightly checked a woman into the boards and gave her a concussion. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=705.54s)]
*  Yeah, because he's a man, she's a woman. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=710.26s)]
*  In October, a North Carolina high school volleyball player suffered a significant head injury [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  after another man dressed as a woman spiked a ball at her head. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=717.26s)]
*  You can watch that on YouTube. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=720.36s)]
*  It's on video. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=721.36s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=722.36s)]
*  But nobody should be surprised that it happened. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=723.66s)]
*  Nine years ago, a man called Fallon Fox declared himself a woman and competed in a mixed martial [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=727.02s)]
*  arts fight against a competitor called Tomeka Brentz, who was a woman. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=732.86s)]
*  In a total of 36 seconds on the mat, Fox fractured the bones in Tomeka Brentz's face and won [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=736.9s)]
*  the fight. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=743.14s)]
*  As Tomeka Brentz later put it, quote, I've never felt so overpowered in my life and I'm [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=744.48s)]
*  an abnormally strong female. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=749.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, because even an abnormally strong female, which she is, is no match for most [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=752.26s)]
*  biological men. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=757.58s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=760.22s)]
*  It is measurable. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=761.5400000000001s)]
*  We don't need to guess. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=763.1800000000001s)]
*  But almost nobody at this point, at this deeply contemptible point of cowardice in the West, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=765.4200000000001s)]
*  almost nobody will say that because they're afraid. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=772.1s)]
*  But Riley Gaines will say that because she's not afraid. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=774.5s)]
*  So last night, Gaines went to San Francisco State University to talk about her experiences [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=776.26s)]
*  in NCAA swimming. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=780.54s)]
*  And Riley Gaines is not a hater. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=782.5s)]
*  She is a measured, decent person who believes in logic and reason and finding common ground [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=784.06s)]
*  with people who disagree with her. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=790.5s)]
*  She does not think she is God. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=792.68s)]
*  But that fact is not believe she's God makes her a terrifying threat to the zealots who [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=795.3s)]
*  do do their God. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=800.42s)]
*  And so at San Francisco State last night, the zealots attacked her. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=802.8s)]
*  A mob surrounded Riley Gaines and prevented her from moving through the hallways. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=806.26s)]
*  At one point, the thugs said they wouldn't let her pass unless she, unless she. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=810.18s)]
*  During the chaos, a man dressed as a woman punched her several times. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=814.7199999999999s)]
*  The mob howled with rage, screaming threats and obscenities. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=818.4599999999999s)]
*  We're not overstating. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=821.8599999999999s)]
*  Here's what it looked like. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=822.8599999999999s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDms8mc68k&t=824.86s)]
