# Tucker: Hunter is probably our greatest painter right now
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE)
*  We made the point a lot on this show because it's true that the entire purpose of the Democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=0.0s)]
*  Party's immigration policy is to change the population of the United States in a way that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=6.92s)]
*  guarantees they win every election going forward. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=11.28s)]
*  This is effectively electorate packing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=14.22s)]
*  It's an assault on democracy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=17.22s)]
*  It devalues your vote. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=18.68s)]
*  It's happening right in front of us, and we've said so out loud. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=21.5s)]
*  And every time we do say it out loud, the usual liars and dummies who imagine themselves [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=23.84s)]
*  to be the gatekeepers of our national conversation throw a fit. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=27.78s)]
*  They become apoplectic. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=31.46s)]
*  They call us the usual names. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=32.64s)]
*  Boo hoo. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=33.94s)]
*  And then after a few days, this is the most interesting part, they inevitably go back [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=35.1s)]
*  to bragging in public about how they're using immigration policy to change the population [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=38.34s)]
*  of the United States in a way that guarantees they win every election going forward. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=42.7s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=46.5s)]
*  And then expect us not to notice. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=47.5s)]
*  Jennifer Rubin is a columnist at the Washington Post. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=49.58s)]
*  Rubin is probably the dumbest person ever to have a newspaper column. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=53.02s)]
*  She's also highly aggressive. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=56.38s)]
*  Actually, she does this a lot because she's got no self-awareness. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=57.74s)]
*  And she did just the other day in print, hoping no one would notice. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=60.22s)]
*  But we did. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=62.54s)]
*  Here's what she wrote, quote, Democratic hopes that demography would deliver Texas have not [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=63.54s)]
*  been wrong, but perhaps just premature. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=68.18s)]
*  The 2020 congressional race has suggested that while the fight for Hispanic votes remains [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=71.14s)]
*  competitive, the sprawling suburbs around major Texas cities are increasingly moderate. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=79.86s)]
*  In other words, crows Jen Rubin, the Great Replacement Plan is working. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=81.38s)]
*  It's helping the Democratic Party. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=87.12s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=88.56s)]
*  Well, thanks for telling us that Jen Rubin. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=89.56s)]
*  And let us know if it's racist to read your column out loud. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=92.68s)]
*  So Hunter Biden, in contrast to a lot of other people in this country, is in a really good [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=99.12s)]
*  place right now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  He's become a painter, finger painting apparently, and he's been selling his works for hundreds [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=105.64s)]
*  of thousands of dollars to unnamed foreign buyers because that's totally legitimate. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  People have criticized him for this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  What does he think? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't care what you think. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  If I was going to choose something, to become an artist and subject yourself to that, the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  normal and criticism of sharing your art to a wider audience than your friends and family [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  is, at least in my book, it's a pretty courageous thing to do. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=135.32s)]
*  You seem to have good spirits about this sort of kind of crazed narrative around your painting [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=141.84s)]
*  How do you... [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=147.48s)]
*  What's your response to the people who are coming after the prices of the work or just [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=148.48s)]
*  the collectors? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=155.2s)]
*  What's been your response to that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=156.2s)]
*  Other than f*** them? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  Honestly, it's kind of hard to blame Hunter Biden for this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, if someone's going to pay you hundreds of thousands of dollars for your art, a hobby [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  you just taken up like 20 minutes ago, would you take the money? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=171.72s)]
*  Of course you would. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=175.68s)]
*  You would do what you could get away with. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=177.28s)]
*  99% of people would. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=179.68s)]
*  It's everyone else who's implicated in this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  The people who are interviewing Hunter Biden and calling any criticism of his art career [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=184.44s)]
*  hyperventilating, it's all political, it's the people buying this crap purely because [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=188.6s)]
*  he's the president's son, and it's the entire media establishment pretending it's not happening. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=192.88s)]
*  Those are the villains in this story. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=198.9s)]
*  Hunter Biden is just a man on the make getting what he can, and he's getting a lot. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=200.88s)]
*  He just hosted an art show in Hollywood. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=204.66s)]
*  It featured hundreds of rich people from around California, including the mayor of the rapidly [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=206.18s)]
*  disintegrating city of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  He was there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=214.82s)]
*  Now, why might that be? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=215.82s)]
*  Because he's a huge art fan? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=217.9s)]
*  Because Hunter Biden, after 50 years of running around, smoking crack, or doing whatever he [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=219.94s)]
*  was doing, became a great artist? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=224.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=226.26s)]
*  No. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=227.26s)]
*  Joe Biden has just nominated Garcetti to be the American ambassador to India. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=228.26s)]
*  Garcetti, you should know, appears in Hunter Biden's laptop on a list of key contacts to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=232.5s)]
*  grease the wheels for Hunter Biden's Chinese business partners. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=237.06s)]
*  It's all so repulsive. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=240.46s)]
*  It's actually happening now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=241.74s)]
*  It's so third world. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=243.14s)]
*  Miranda Devine has chronicled it really like nobody else. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=244.7s)]
*  She works at the New York Post, and we're grateful to have her with us tonight. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=246.74s)]
*  Miranda, have you purchased one of these paintings? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=249.74s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=252.7s)]
*  They're really out of my price range. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=255.26s)]
*  And we're talking about up to $500,000. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=258.06s)]
*  And they don't really strike me as being so good that I want them on my walls. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=260.34s)]
*  Maybe as a novelty item, I think maybe a lot of people would be buying it because Hunter [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=265.26s)]
*  Biden has become now so notorious through his laptop, one of three that he's mislaid [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=269.62s)]
*  around the place. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=275.7s)]
*  And we can laugh at him. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=277.22s)]
*  And as you say, he doesn't care. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=279.86s)]
*  He's untouchable now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=282.38s)]
*  His father is the president. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=283.9s)]
*  And whatever grift he's up to, it's really Joe Biden's grift. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=285.86s)]
*  It's the president's grift. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=289.74s)]
*  And now it's the White House's grift. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  And so it's everyone's problem, particularly the Democrats. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=293.38s)]
*  And I think anyone who goes to these Hunter Biden art shows, there's another one happening [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=297.14s)]
*  in New York in the fall later on, if they go, they are legitimizing what is really just [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=301.34s)]
*  a racket. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, the entire art world is a tax dodge. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  And I think that's well known to rich people. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=313.68s)]
*  I'm not sure a lot of people understand that, but a lot of it's just about tax avoidance, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=315.42s)]
*  of course. But what about all these so-called art critics and newspaper reporters who, under [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=318.78s)]
*  any other circumstances, would be covering this with at least some amusement and they're [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  totally ignoring it? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=328.74s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's like everything that plays badly for Joe Biden. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=331.58s)]
*  You saw it before the election when we published our stories on the laptop that were [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=335.78s)]
*  suppressed. And you've seen it ever since. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=339.74s)]
*  Anything that's negative about Joe Biden is covered up and excused and explained away. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=341.9s)]
*  And any bad optics are quickly mopped up. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=348.58s)]
*  That's, I guess, what the White House is good at. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=351.26s)]
*  And we know that Hunter Biden is under investigation for money laundering, among other [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  problems. And we know that the art world is notorious for being a venue for money [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=359.5s)]
*  laundering. So it really takes a lot of chutzpah for him to do this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=366.02s)]
*  But that's the byword, I think, of the Biden administration is shamelessness. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=370.34s)]
*  It's shameless that the president is isn't even pretending to distance himself from [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=375.73999999999995s)]
*  what's going on. He keeps on hiding behind this mirage of being just a kindly, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=381.58s)]
*  fatherly family man when he's been in on this influence peddling enrichment program [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=387.38s)]
*  from the start. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=395.38s)]
*  None of these people ever do anything useful. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=396.5s)]
*  Like you're getting off drugs. Good for you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=398.66s)]
*  Why not learn HVAC repair, how to fix a diesel engine or how to take drywall? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's always some BS fake. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, I'm a lobbyist. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=407.70000000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? I'm a consultant, an artist like none of it's real. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeSMDT9DJE&t=409.26000000000005s)]
