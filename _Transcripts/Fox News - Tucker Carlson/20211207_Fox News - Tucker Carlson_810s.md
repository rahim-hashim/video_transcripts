# Tucker: Why is the United States doing this?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, here's something all of us need to begin to internalize. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Just because something seems far-fetched or it seems crazy or it seems totally destructive [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=8.64s)]
*  to core American interests doesn't mean the U.S. government won't do it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=14.4s)]
*  That's the main lesson of the moment we're living in. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=19.92s)]
*  So, with that in mind, do not discount, no matter how far-fetched it may seem, a hot [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=22.16s)]
*  war with Russia. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=27.28s)]
*  Yes, that is a lunatic idea. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=29.28s)]
*  There is nothing we could possibly gain from a military confrontation with Vladimir Putin, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=31.2s)]
*  and there's very much we could lose, including, of course, many thousands of American lives. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=35.2s)]
*  But that doesn't mean Joe Biden won't do it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=40.24s)]
*  Biden is unpopular, he's incompetent, and he's desperate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  But more than anything, Joe Biden is weak. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  He is a pawn of his staff and the hard-eyed ideologues who surround him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  Russia is currently involved in a border dispute with neighboring Ukraine. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=54.96s)]
*  Many of Biden's closest aides are pushing the United States to get involved militarily. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=58.6s)]
*  Now among the many, many ironies here is that the Ukraine crisis was largely created by [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=63.88s)]
*  Joe Biden's own aides and many people like them throughout all levels of the U.S. government. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=69.08s)]
*  So here's the Russian position. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=75.28s)]
*  For Russia, the core question is NATO. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=76.8s)]
*  NATO was the post-war military alliance created in 1949 to keep the Soviets from invading [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=79.64s)]
*  Western Europe, and it worked pretty well for about 40 years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=84.68s)]
*  But the Soviet Union has not existed in more than three decades. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=88.04s)]
*  It's part of history now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=91.48s)]
*  And yet NATO very much lives on, better funded than ever. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  It is an army without a purpose. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=96.92s)]
*  So at this point, NATO exists primarily to torment Vladimir Putin, who, whatever his many [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=99.12s)]
*  faults, has no intention of invading Western Europe. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=103.72s)]
*  Vladimir Putin does not want Belgium. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=107.92s)]
*  He just wants to keep his Western border secure. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=109.94000000000001s)]
*  That's why he doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=112.62s)]
*  And that makes sense. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=115.26s)]
*  Imagine how we would feel if Mexico and Canada became satellites of China. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=116.56s)]
*  We wouldn't like that at all. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=120.84s)]
*  In Russia's case, this is an existential question. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=122.56s)]
*  A NATO takeover of Ukraine would compromise Russia's access to its Sevastopol Naval Base. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=125.44s)]
*  That's the site of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and one of the country's only connections [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=131.18s)]
*  to international waters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=134.6s)]
*  In the words of Russia scholar Richard Sackwa, if Russia lost the Sevastopol Naval Base, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=136.74s)]
*  it would be, quote, the biggest military geopolitical defeat of Russia in the last [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=141.48s)]
*  thousand years. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=145.72s)]
*  So for Vladimir Putin, that's unacceptable. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=147.62s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=149.32s)]
*  He cannot let it happen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=150.42s)]
*  He will not let it happen. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  But for the United States, and this is the main point here, there would be no benefit [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=153.33999999999997s)]
*  either. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  The United States would gain precisely nothing from taking over Ukraine. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=158.67999999999998s)]
*  Why would we want to do that? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=162.28s)]
*  At best, we'd be driving Russia, and we are in fact deeper into the arms of the government [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  of China. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  And that would be a disaster for the United States and a disaster for the world. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=170.28s)]
*  So why are we doing this? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=174.56s)]
*  Why is the U.S. government pushing Ukraine to join NATO? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=175.74s)]
*  Well, God knows why. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=179.4s)]
*  But we are doing this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  Both parties are doing this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  The neocons around Joe Biden are for it, of course, as they are for every sinister and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  stupid idea. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=188.52s)]
*  But so is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a smart man. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=189.78s)]
*  So is Ohio Senator Rob Portman. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=192.56s)]
*  So are many Republicans. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=195.24s)]
*  So this is a bipartisan sort of insanity. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=197.32s)]
*  The question is, can Joe Biden stand up to it? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  And the answer is, come on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  Biden has always been more lobbyist than leader. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  He says what he's told to say. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  Once it was the credit card companies in Delaware that wrote his scripts. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=209.16s)]
*  Now it's the neocons at the State Department. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=211.72s)]
*  It's the same idea. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=213.28s)]
*  Biden spoke today with Vladimir Putin by video call, and according to the White House, he [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  informed the Russian leader that the United States plans to control Ukraine no matter [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=218.6s)]
*  what. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=222.84s)]
*  Secretary of State and struggling pop musician Tony Blinken repeated that message. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=224.36s)]
*  He threatened to send American troops there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=228.16s)]
*  Here's Tony Blinken's spokesman. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=230.6s)]
*  If Russia chooses to fail, to deescalate, if Russia chooses to move forward with any [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=233.4s)]
*  plans it may have developed to continue its military aggression or to aggress militarily [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=238.12s)]
*  upon Ukraine, to violate Ukraine's sovereignty, its independence, its territorial integrity, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=245.16s)]
*  we and our allies would be prepared to act. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=252.5s)]
*  We would be prepared to act resolutely. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  These such children. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=260.3s)]
*  Ukraine's territorial integrity, that's the concern. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=262.09999999999997s)]
*  That's what this is really about, they're telling us, because if there's one thing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=264.97999999999996s)]
*  the Biden White House cares about, it's secure borders, at least in Eastern Europe, where [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=269.18s)]
*  borders are not racist. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=273.94s)]
*  Ukraine's borders must be defended. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=276.09999999999997s)]
*  It would be immoral to open those borders to the world and allow, say, tens of thousands [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  of unemployed Haitians to pour across. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=283.38000000000005s)]
*  We can't allow that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=285.82000000000005s)]
*  In fact, we will send American troops to Ukraine to prevent that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=286.82000000000005s)]
*  Open borders are only permitted in Texas, Arizona, and California, and anywhere else [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=290.6s)]
*  that potential Democratic voters might arrive uninvited from the Third World. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=295.06s)]
*  But Ukraine? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=298.5s)]
*  No. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=299.5s)]
*  Ukraine is a God-given right to territorial integrity, and American soldiers will die [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=300.5s)]
*  to defend that territorial integrity. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=305.54s)]
*  That's our official position as a country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=309.22s)]
*  Now according to CNN, we must stop these Russian attacks on the sacred borders of Ukraine, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=312.22s)]
*  because if we don't stop them, what we could have here is what CNN is calling a dire security [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=317.38s)]
*  situation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=322.94s)]
*  Now that phrase apparently comes from Joe Biden's Under Secretary of State, Toria Nuland, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=324.38s)]
*  who according to CNN gave a quote, gloomy briefing to US senators last night. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=328.3s)]
*  Now Toria Nuland is strongly in favor of or with Russia. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=333.3s)]
*  What's amazing is that anyone, anywhere, is still listening to her. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=336.38s)]
*  No serious person could take Victoria Nuland seriously. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  She's a joke. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=344.54s)]
*  Not only is she obviously unimpressive as a person, ask anyone who knows her, and she's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=345.66s)]
*  not especially pro-American, by the way, she was one of the architects of the disaster [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=348.74s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=353.26s)]
*  So why is Toria Nuland still talking about foreign policy? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  Is the guy who designed Chernobyl still building nuclear reactors? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=358.3s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=362.94s)]
*  Only in Washington, where failure is assiduously rewarded, could someone like Victoria Nuland [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=364.34s)]
*  still wield power, which she absolutely does. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=368.86s)]
*  It's scary when you think about it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=372.1s)]
*  Toria Nuland is driving our Ukraine policy, which of course is being justified by our [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=373.82s)]
*  broader support for quote, democracy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=378.66s)]
*  Now keep that in mind as you listen to this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=381.54s)]
*  This is the same, the same Toria Nuland, who was caught on tape several years ago scheming [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=383.7s)]
*  about how to end democracy in Ukraine. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=389.94s)]
*  Here's Nuland in a leaked audio recording plotting the overthrow of Ukraine's democratically [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=393.5s)]
*  elected president. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=398.53999999999996s)]
*  Listen as Nuland rattles off a list of potential puppets to install in place of the democratically [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=400.42s)]
*  elected president. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=404.8s)]
*  I think Yats is the guy who's got the economic experience, the governing experience. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=405.8s)]
*  He's the guy, you know, what he needs is cleech and tawny book on the outside. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=409.86s)]
*  He needs to be talking to them four times a week. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=413.98s)]
*  You know, I just think cleech going in, he's going to be at that level working for Yats [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=416.62s)]
*  and Yook. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=423.1s)]
*  It's just not going to work. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=424.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think that's right. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=425.1s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=426.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=427.1s)]
*  It's just not going to work. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=428.1s)]
*  What are the voters of Ukraine who thought they were engaged in democracy? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=429.1s)]
*  Nope, there's Toria Nuland working to overthrow democracy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=432.18s)]
*  Keep in mind, if they'll do it there, they will do it here. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=435.38s)]
*  You're hearing the same State Department goon who worked to organize a coup in Ukraine telling [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=438.9s)]
*  us we need to go to war with Russia to preserve democracy in Ukraine. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=445.04s)]
*  These people have no shame. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=450.36s)]
*  So the question is, what is this really about? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=452.68s)]
*  Of course it's not about democracy, for which they have zero respect. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=454.16s)]
*  Well, in part, it's a hangover from the lunatic Russia hoax that absorbed Washington for three [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=456.68s)]
*  years. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=461.24s)]
*  Everything about Vladimir Putin is bad, therefore let's have a war with him. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=462.24s)]
*  A lot of people think that, but there's also a deeper cause here that's rarely noted. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=465.36s)]
*  For years, Ukrainian interests have pumped millions of lobbying dollars into Washington, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=470.4s)]
*  D.C. to change American foreign policy in the region. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=475.32s)]
*  At one point, as you may have heard, they employed the president's own son to repeat [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  their talking points. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=483.52s)]
*  So tens of thousands of dollars a month to tell us that Russia is bad and we need to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=484.96s)]
*  stand with Ukraine because democracy, even as we work to overthrow democracy in Ukraine. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  So with that in mind, now that you know that, maybe you were not so surprised when Joe Biden [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  concluded that Vladimir Putin doesn't possess a soul. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=499.04s)]
*  You said you know he doesn't have a soul. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=503.36s)]
*  Well, I did say that to him, yes. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=504.92s)]
*  And his response was, we understand one another. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't be a wise guy. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  I was alone with him in his office. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  That's how it came about. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=513.64s)]
*  It was when President Bush said, I've looked in his eyes and saw a soul. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=514.64s)]
*  I said, look in your eyes and I don't think you have a soul. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=519.64s)]
*  And look back and we said, we understand each other. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=522.44s)]
*  So you know Vladimir Putin. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=524.46s)]
*  You think he's a killer? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  These people are children. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=529.0799999999999s)]
*  Again, children pretending to be leaders. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's a killer! [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=532.68s)]
*  Presumably unlike every other head of state on earth through all human history. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=534.64s)]
*  But honestly, that is not the relevant question. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=539.76s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's soul? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=544.64s)]
*  We can leave that to his priest assuming he has one. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=546.02s)]
*  The only question that matters, the only question is how does intervening in Ukraine help the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=548.76s)]
*  core interests of the United States? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=554.04s)]
*  And of course that is the one question no one in Washington is asking. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=556.24s)]
*  Watch the Pentagon's obedient little flack, a man with so little dignity he'll say whatever [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=560.6400000000001s)]
*  he's told to say, brag about how much military equipment we are now sending to Ukraine. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=563.76s)]
*  And notice as you watch this tape that he never even thinks about explaining why we [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=569.76s)]
*  would be sending that military equipment. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=574.24s)]
*  We have provided millions of dollars worth of lethal and non-lethal assistance to Ukraine [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=577.36s)]
*  in just the last 10 months, 11 months. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=583.92s)]
*  Nothing has changed about our commitment to making sure that Ukraine has what it needs [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=586.76s)]
*  to defend itself. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=593.0s)]
*  So say what you will about Donald Trump and his Twitter account. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  Maybe you liked him, maybe you're appalled by his personal style. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  But in retrospect, if there is one thing that Donald Trump deserves eternal credit for, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=603.4799999999999s)]
*  it's keeping idiots like that in their box for four years. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=608.88s)]
*  There were no pointless wars under Donald Trump. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=612.4s)]
*  That is not a small thing in recent American history. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=615.6s)]
*  In fact, it's rarely happened over the past century. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=617.72s)]
*  But through unwavering determination for which he has not gotten credit, if there's one thing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=621.24s)]
*  he deserves credit for, it's this. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=625.52s)]
*  Donald Trump pulled that off. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=627.12s)]
*  He resisted again and again when members of Congress and guys from Raytheon, when all [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=629.52s)]
*  the interested parties pushed him to go to war here, there, and everywhere, Donald Trump [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=634.6s)]
*  resisted that. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=638.52s)]
*  And in Washington, above all, they hated him for that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=640.56s)]
*  In the end, they impeached him for it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=644.3399999999999s)]
*  As one witness put it during our impeachment inquiry, the United States aids Ukraine and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  her people so that we can fight Russia over there and we don't have to fight Russia here. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=652.5799999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=657.88s)]
*  We're going to fight Russia here? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=658.88s)]
*  Are we Adam Schiff? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=661.16s)]
*  Adam Schiff, of course, a dumb person and a partisan Democrat. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=662.16s)]
*  But what's so interesting, and ought to make you sit up and pay attention, is suddenly [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=666.12s)]
*  partisan Republicans are making identical noises. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=670.32s)]
*  Just this afternoon, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, not a genius famously, but [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  still a sitting Republican senator, went on Fox News to say we may need to send American [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=677.52s)]
*  troops to Ukraine, and possibly, because this isn't insane or anything, think about the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=682.92s)]
*  use of nuclear weapons. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=687.66s)]
*  Got that in our back pocket. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=689.48s)]
*  Nuclear weapons. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=690.84s)]
*  Roger Wicker, sitting U.S. senator. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=692.88s)]
*  No one in Washington laughed at Roger Wicker. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=696.08s)]
*  This is so crazy that no one seems aware of how crazy it is. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=698.64s)]
*  They're all just sitting back and listening to Toria Nuland tell them what we need to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=703.72s)]
*  do. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=708.5200000000001s)]
*  How much has this penetrated the psyche of Washington, D.C.? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=710.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, here's a sad piece of tape. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=713.88s)]
*  This is Joni Ernst, who's totally affable, nice Republican, sort of reasonable on most [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=715.5400000000001s)]
*  things from the Midwest. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  Suddenly sounding like a bloodthirsty warmonger, sounding a lot like actually Adam Schiff when [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  she talks about that dastardly Vladimir Putin. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=725.48s)]
*  He needs to say to Vladimir Putin that we are no longer going to allow you to continue [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=729.0200000000001s)]
*  with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=735.8800000000001s)]
*  We need you to know and understand that we will defend Ukraine. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=738.44s)]
*  We will provide them assistance. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=742.22s)]
*  He needs to make that very clear. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=744.2800000000001s)]
*  Putin is so bad, we're going to cut off natural gas to Western Europe in retaliation against [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=748.24s)]
*  him in December. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=755.08s)]
*  We're going to freeze Germany in Luxembourg and that's going to teach Vladimir Putin. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=757.48s)]
*  Again, what you just saw there is a child who has no idea what she's talking about, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=762.64s)]
*  but keeps talking anyway. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=768.88s)]
*  We will defend Ukraine, says Joni Ernst. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=770.72s)]
*  Remember, this is a senator from Iowa. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=773.24s)]
*  So what happens if we don't defend Ukraine, Joni Ernst? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=776.04s)]
*  Will kids in Des Moines grow up to speak Russian? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=779.2s)]
*  No one asked her that question. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=781.88s)]
*  She's never thought about it for a moment that all this reading from the same talking [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=783.0s)]
*  points from Adam Schiff to Roger Wicker to Joni Ernst. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=787.24s)]
*  It turns out that foreign lobbying campaigns work pretty well and that's why the Ukrainians [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=791.48s)]
*  paid for one in Washington. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0ypSr1SGY&t=795.84s)]
