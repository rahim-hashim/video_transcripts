# Tucker: There is only one word to describe this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg)
*  The number of illegal aliens streaming across our border has just hit a new all-time record. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=0.0s)]
*  Never before have we seen anything like this. More than a quarter of a million foreign nationals were [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=5.68s)]
*  stopped last month alone. So that's an invasion. There's no other word for it. It's having an [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=11.92s)]
*  effect on every part of American life. It's having an effect on farmers. Alex Mueller is a farmer in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=18.16s)]
*  Yuma, Arizona, the president of the Pascualinoli Produce Company. He joins us tonight to tell us [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=23.6s)]
*  what he has firsthand been experiencing. Alex, thanks so much for coming on. So we don't hear [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=28.4s)]
*  often enough from people in border states about what it looks like to them. What's your experience been? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=35.12s)]
*  Well, hello Tucker. Thanks for having me. Over the last two years, it's just been a death by a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=42.0s)]
*  thousand cuts. It's been a slow trickle and we're seeing it every day. We're right, this is the end [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  of the border here and we have a field of lettuce here and the community here has seen an uptick in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=55.92s)]
*  crossers and it's just been continuous and continuous and it's taxing and it's hard for us [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=64.56s)]
*  to do our jobs when we take food safety as at the utmost for what we do and anytime anybody enters [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=70.8s)]
*  our field we have to cordon that off and flag it and we don't harvest that area just like if a coyote [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=82.08s)]
*  enters our field we can't harvest that area so when there's 20 people 30 people but sometimes [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=89.12s)]
*  there's 100 out there about a quarter mile down mostly they cross but there's gaps along the wall [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=95.36s)]
*  that they're crossing over and it's an additional aspect of our job that is sort of out of our [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=102.4s)]
*  wheelhouse. Well you shouldn't have to contend with border security, you're a lettuce farmer, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=109.04s)]
*  the state and the federal government should be doing that for you, that's their main job, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=115.68s)]
*  that's why they exist. Are they and why aren't they? Apparently they're not. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  Well no, they're not and we live in a border community and the border patrol are our friends [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  and the border patrol are our glorified travel agency now and you know they're there people [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=133.28s)]
*  cross them down here a quarter mile and border patrol comes down and they put people in buses, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=144.16s)]
*  they take them to a tent city that where the border patrol station is there's probably 5,000 [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=150.24s)]
*  people there at any given time and they're giving them bus passes or airplane tickets and they're [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=156.8s)]
*  flying all over the country and it's been insane to watch for the last two years and it's something [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=161.44s)]
*  that we need help down here and we want to bring light to this situation. Of course. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=167.84s)]
*  You're so meticulous in your job that you just told us if a coyote crosses into your field you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=176.72s)]
*  will not sell the produce the coyote touched. So how does it feel to... We don't sell the produce and... [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=182.0s)]
*  Right, but so here's the government abetting crime. The people who are supposed to be stopping the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=187.68s)]
*  crime are making it possible, rewarding the crime with free airline tickets. As an American how does [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=192.96s)]
*  that feel? Well at a time you know we're coming out of the pandemic and at a time when all of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=199.68s)]
*  costs across the border are up. Our freight costs are up double, fuel costs are up 30%, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=205.44s)]
*  input costs are up 30%. It's an additional cost that gets sent down to the to the end user, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=211.28s)]
*  the American public and we're very proud of what we do. My wife's family has been farming here for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=217.12s)]
*  75 years and we're one of the young guys on the block and we're proud of this. We're proud of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=221.6s)]
*  what we provide to the American people and this has been going on for two years. It's not stopping. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=228.0s)]
*  I mean I could tell you anecdotally a couple stories where a border patrol agent in front of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=234.32s)]
*  mine saw somebody crossing that had two people crossing with him that he was paying to carry his [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=239.36s)]
*  Louis Vuitton luggage and then on the same hand I've seen a little girl crossing that was a five [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=245.28s)]
*  year old with a phone number pinned to her chest and she was alone. I saw that with my own eyes [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=250.72000000000003s)]
*  and it's been going on for two years and we need help down here and it's not something that it's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=256.32s)]
*  in our wheelhouse. It's not something the city of Yuma needs to deal with. Of course. Yeah we'd like [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=263.04s)]
*  to get some help. I hope you get it. This is an atrocity such an expression of deep [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=267.28s)]
*  disrespect for our nation. Thank you. Alex Milner, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoULp5hleg&t=272.79999999999995s)]
