# Tucker: We’re watching civilization collapse in real time
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carl's Tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to begin by noting something obvious [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=2.64s)]
*  because this is the obvious show. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=4.72s)]
*  If you live in the United States, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=7.08s)]
*  you may have noticed that many of our public spaces [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=8.48s)]
*  have become permanent homeless encampments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=10.5s)]
*  You see trash-filled tents blotting out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=13.42s)]
*  what were once green and tidy public parks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=15.8s)]
*  You step over vagrants drooling unconscious [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=18.96s)]
*  on the steps of train stations on the way to work. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=21.38s)]
*  You watch as junkies smoke meth [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=23.88s)]
*  without any embarrassment at all [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=25.48s)]
*  and then yell at pedestrians on the sidewalk, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=26.86s)]
*  maybe at your children. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=28.68s)]
*  Everywhere, at every intersection, there are beggars. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=30.28s)]
*  It's what we used to imagine India was like, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=33.44s)]
*  but this is not Calcutta. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=35.36s)]
*  This is New York and San Francisco and Austin, Texas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=36.72s)]
*  So the question is, what happened? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=39.9s)]
*  And the short answer is, our leaders did this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=42.24s)]
*  No matter what they tell you, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=45.46s)]
*  homelessness is not an act of God. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=46.44s)]
*  It's not the result of economic collapse in this country. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=48.54s)]
*  America did not run out of housing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=51.16s)]
*  Instead, a determined group of well-funded ideologues [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=53.72s)]
*  decided to make it easier to live on the streets [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=56.38s)]
*  in this country while doing drugs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  Therefore, many more people now live on the streets [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=60.92s)]
*  while doing drugs. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=63.14s)]
*  See, not complicated. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=64.5s)]
*  In 2005, an unemployed alcoholic called Basil Humphrey [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=67.14s)]
*  enrolled in a rehab program in Boise, Idaho. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=70.5s)]
*  When Humphrey refused to stop drinking, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=73.5s)]
*  the rescue mission kicked him out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=75.06s)]
*  Those were the rules, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  and he spent months sleeping outside, as so many do. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  Eventually, local authorities ticketed him [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=81.06s)]
*  for camping on public property. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=82.94s)]
*  That was the law. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=84.22s)]
*  The story would have ended there, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=85.62s)]
*  except that a huge corporate law firm in New York City [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=87.04s)]
*  called Latham & Watkins took an interest in the case [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  on the other side of the country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  Now, typically, Latham & Watkins represents Wall Street banks [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=94.22s)]
*  and prominent Democratic office holders, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=96.94s)]
*  but the firm wanted to change vagrancy laws [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=99.42s)]
*  to increase homelessness. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=102.06s)]
*  Why did they want that? We don't know. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=103.58000000000001s)]
*  But the firm filed a lawsuit on Basil Humphrey's behalf [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  against the city of Boise. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  That suit made it to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=110.26s)]
*  In 2018, the court declared [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=113.0s)]
*  that cities have no right to criminalize homelessness. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=114.66s)]
*  In fact, the court ruled cities have an obligation [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  to provide free housing to the homeless at public expense. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  The Supreme Court later upheld that ruling. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=124.16s)]
*  The case was known as Martin v. Boise, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  and it had exactly the effect [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=128.9s)]
*  that Latham & Watkins intended. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=130.66s)]
*  City officials across the country [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=133.22s)]
*  no longer had an obligation to protect the public [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=135.0s)]
*  and public spaces from drug addicts [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  who decided to live in them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=140.26s)]
*  At the same time, politicians suddenly had access [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=143.34s)]
*  to a massive new source of cash, taxpayer money, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=145.54000000000002s)]
*  many billions in taxpayer money, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=149.06s)]
*  for something called homelessness prevention. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  Now, what is homelessness prevention? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=154.28s)]
*  Well, of course, it's the opposite [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  of what they call it, as always. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=157.34s)]
*  Here's Seattle's interpretation of homelessness prevention. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  A handful of Seattle's more than 12,000 homeless [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  will soon be going from the street to a new apartment [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=166.06s)]
*  with stunning views of the Space Needle and Puget Sound, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  using part of its share [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=172.28s)]
*  of the $1.9 trillion COVID relief package, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=173.32s)]
*  the city bought three brand new apartment buildings [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=176.44s)]
*  for $50 million for 165 homeless, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=179.2s)]
*  a price of $300,000 per unit. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  In Los Angeles, Skid Row is about to get a new neighbor, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=185.44s)]
*  a 19-story high rise for homeless, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=188.48s)]
*  costing taxpayers $160 million or $580,000 per unit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=191.12s)]
*  They're part of an expensive push [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=197.54s)]
*  to get the homeless off of sidewalks and out of city parks [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=199.08s)]
*  and into government-subsidized housing, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=202.12s)]
*  even if it means buying new buildings [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=204.48s)]
*  at market rate from developers. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=206.32s)]
*  Oh, stunning views of the Space Needle and Puget Sound. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=209.84s)]
*  Do you have one of those? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, crackheads do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=214.92s)]
*  More than half a million dollars per apartment [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=216.72s)]
*  to house drug addicts at public expense, at market rates. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  So you can see why real estate developers [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=224.22s)]
*  would strongly support a program like that, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=226.0s)]
*  and of course, they strongly do. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=227.76s)]
*  But luxury apartments are just the beginning. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=229.76s)]
*  Seattle's most recent municipal budget allocates [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=233.12s)]
*  more than $150 million [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=235.56s)]
*  to other so-called homelessness programs just this year. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=237.36s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=240.88s)]
*  Seattle has fewer than 750,000 people living there, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=241.72s)]
*  so that's an awful lot of money per bum. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=244.76s)]
*  It's certainly a lot more than anyone else [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=247.76s)]
*  is getting in Seattle. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  At the same time, it was giving overpriced condos [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=250.88s)]
*  to drug addicts with stunning views of Puget Sound. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=253.56s)]
*  Seattle allocated just $10 million total [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=256.52s)]
*  for its small business stabilization fund [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=259.48s)]
*  designed to keep family businesses [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=261.92s)]
*  from going bankrupt during the COVID lockdowns. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=263.6s)]
*  So the city's priorities could not be clearer than that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=266.64000000000004s)]
*  You lavish money on the least productive, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=269.04s)]
*  most antisocial parasites in our society, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=271.24s)]
*  and then you punish Americans who work for a living. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=274.0s)]
*  Got it? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  And it's hardly just Seattle. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  The latest city budget in San Francisco [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=279.8s)]
*  proposes spending $667 million [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=281.44s)]
*  on something called the Department of Homelessness [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  and Supportive Housing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=286.36s)]
*  And yet, at the very same time, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  San Francisco's Department of Children, Youth, and Families [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=290.12s)]
*  gets less than half that amount. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  A city program designed to help low-income families [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=295.8s)]
*  page college tuition gets just $16 million total. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=298.0s)]
*  That's about 2% of what the homeless get. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  So in San Francisco, it makes sense. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=305.44s)]
*  In fact, it pays to get high on the sidewalk. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Don't bother to get an education. Nobody cares. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=309.76s)]
*  That's the message from the city. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=312.26s)]
*  Couldn't be clearer. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=313.6s)]
*  In Austin, Texas, the city's budget [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=315.38s)]
*  for homelessness assistance was $68 million last year. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=317.08s)]
*  At the very same time, the city of Austin [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=320.84s)]
*  spent just $3.5 million in new loans [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=323.32s)]
*  for struggling small businesses, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=326.02s)]
*  and only $7 million for, quote, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=327.52s)]
*  mission-critical infrastructure [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=329.88s)]
*  and deferred maintenance at city facilities, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=331.68s)]
*  like the things that matter. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=333.7s)]
*  And at the same time as this was going on, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=335.18s)]
*  the police department in the city of Austin [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  got an $11 million budget cut. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=339.44s)]
*  So what happened to the homelessness in Austin, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=342.64s)]
*  the problem they were trying to, quote, solve? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, to no one's surprise, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=346.9s)]
*  it has grown by 10% in just two years. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=348.26s)]
*  You get what you pay for. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=351.2s)]
*  When you pay for homelessness, you get a lot more of it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=352.38s)]
*  See how that works? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=354.82s)]
*  In Los Angeles, politicians have spent billions, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=356.44s)]
*  quote, fighting homelessness. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=359.14s)]
*  This has been accompanied, of course, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  by a massive increase in the number of people [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=362.88s)]
*  who are homeless. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  Four years ago, the city spent $440 million [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=366.97999999999996s)]
*  on what it called solutions to homelessness. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=369.73999999999995s)]
*  That was supposed to fix the problem, did it? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=371.82s)]
*  Homelessness in Los Angeles jumped 15% just last year. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=374.62s)]
*  So this year, LA will spend more, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=378.62s)]
*  close to a billion dollars on the homeless in 2022. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=381.06s)]
*  As for the small businesses crushed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=385.26s)]
*  by the city's lunatic COVID restrictions, you ask, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=387.02s)]
*  what'll they get? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=389.58s)]
*  Well, they get $62 million total. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=390.42s)]
*  The city's gang reduction program gets about half that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=392.9s)]
*  So politicians in Los Angeles are, at the very least, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=396.54s)]
*  very clear about their priorities. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=398.74s)]
*  What has this done to LA? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=401.5s)]
*  Well, I think we don't have to look far [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=402.58s)]
*  to see the answer to that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=403.41999999999996s)]
*  Last week, a homeless man walked into a furniture store [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=405.02s)]
*  in the west side of Los Angeles [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=407.97999999999996s)]
*  and murdered a graduate student who was working alone there. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=409.26s)]
*  He stabbed her to death for no apparent reason [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=412.46s)]
*  and then walked out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=414.7s)]
*  He's still at large. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=415.74s)]
*  She was 24, now she's dead. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=416.7s)]
*  Today, her father told Fox and friends [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=419.38s)]
*  that he holds city officials responsible for the killing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=420.97999999999996s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=423.18s)]
*  What's endemic in our society right now [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=424.5s)]
*  is that everybody seems to be oriented on giving back rights [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=426.46s)]
*  and bestowing favor on people that rob others [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=431.7s)]
*  of their rights. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=438.94s)]
*  We should be celebrating the good in people [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=440.62s)]
*  and trying to recognize that that's the job they have [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=443.9s)]
*  is to try to elevate that, to make communities better, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=448.62s)]
*  to make people care more, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=450.97999999999996s)]
*  to not tear down communities by exposing them [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=452.85999999999996s)]
*  to people that are falling out the bottom [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=458.62s)]
*  that really don't care about the other human beings [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=462.26s)]
*  and just think they can do whatever they like in our society [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=466.18s)]
*  and they are doing it more and more in every community. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=470.38s)]
*  Pretty composed for a man who just lost his child, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=475.3s)]
*  but he's absolutely right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=477.54s)]
*  Focusing our attention and our money [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=479.14s)]
*  on people who contribute nothing, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=482.54s)]
*  who only detract from the project that is this country, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=484.7s)]
*  don't help their communities or anybody's community, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=488.06s)]
*  who hurt other people, who live solely for themselves, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=490.53999999999996s)]
*  who are a danger to the rest of us, that's insane. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=493.34s)]
*  And so that girl died and she wasn't the only one. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=496.78s)]
*  Last month in Los Angeles, a man called Kerry Bell [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=499.5s)]
*  murdered a 70-year-old emergency room nurse. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=501.85999999999996s)]
*  She was on her way to work, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=504.02s)]
*  one of the people we should be celebrating, now she's dead. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  Who's the man who killed her? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=507.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, Bell had a long criminal record. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=508.7s)]
*  He had a prior arrest in LA. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=510.09999999999997s)]
*  He had arrest in other states as well. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=511.85999999999996s)]
*  But authorities let him go and kept letting him go. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=513.8199999999999s)]
*  Bell was homeless, he was a victim. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=516.4599999999999s)]
*  He was part of a protected class. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=518.22s)]
*  And then he killed somebody. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=520.98s)]
*  Here's Fox LA's report on that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=522.22s)]
*  Days after a brutal attack at a Union Station bus stop, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=524.66s)]
*  a beloved nurse lost her life. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=527.98s)]
*  Sandra Shells worked at LA County, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=530.3399999999999s)]
*  USC Medical Center for decades, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=532.1s)]
*  where she was highly respected and revered. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=534.02s)]
*  Shells was allegedly assaulted Thursday morning [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=536.54s)]
*  by a homeless man, now identified by police [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=538.98s)]
*  as 48-year-old Kerry Bell. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=541.4599999999999s)]
*  They say he hit Shells for no apparent reason, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=544.38s)]
*  the force knocking her to the ground [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=546.38s)]
*  and fracturing her skull. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=548.1s)]
*  Police say they found him sleeping nearby [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=549.86s)]
*  about 90 minutes later and arrested him without incident. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=551.82s)]
*  She was an emergency room nurse, walking alone to work. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=556.1s)]
*  And now she's dead, another woman murdered by the homeless. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=560.38s)]
*  And don't lie to yourself, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=564.38s)]
*  no one in LA is ever gonna do anything about it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=565.34s)]
*  Probably gonna hear outraged noises for a few days, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=567.98s)]
*  harumph, harumph, harumph. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=570.1s)]
*  But politicians will quickly get back [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=571.7800000000001s)]
*  to showering the unhoused community with another billion dollars. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=573.18s)]
*  What you're watching here [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=577.0999999999999s)]
*  is civilization collapsing in real time. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=578.06s)]
*  And it's not new. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=580.42s)]
*  Here's video our producer shot in Los Angeles [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=581.5s)]
*  in the spring of 2019, almost three years ago. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=583.5799999999999s)]
*  It shows homeless encampments downtown [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=586.7399999999999s)]
*  on three separate blocks. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=588.66s)]
*  It starts at Fifth and San Pedro, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  and then it goes west, seemingly forever. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=591.54s)]
*  So in January of 2020, the LA Times reported that, quote, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=593.9799999999999s)]
*  California's railroad tracks are now lined [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=597.18s)]
*  with men and women sleeping in tents [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=599.5s)]
*  or under cardboard boxes. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=601.06s)]
*  In America, by the way. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=602.34s)]
*  Well, in response to this, Governor Gavin Newsom [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=604.3000000000001s)]
*  announced another $12 billion in state funding [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=607.34s)]
*  to, quote, fight homelessness. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=610.6600000000001s)]
*  How'd that work? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=613.02s)]
*  We'll hear the results. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=613.86s)]
*  From SkyFox, the images are startling. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=615.7s)]
*  Thousands of empty or damaged packages lining the tracks [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=618.1s)]
*  along the Union Pacific LA Railway. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=621.38s)]
*  Amazon packages, UPS boxes, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=623.98s)]
*  all meant for delivery to customers along the West Coast. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=626.46s)]
*  They're opened by cargo thieves [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=629.58s)]
*  who take advantage of the trains stopping or slowing down [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=631.22s)]
*  to break into the containers. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=634.6600000000001s)]
*  Union Pacific officials saying they've had 160% increase [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=636.4200000000001s)]
*  in cargo thefts in the LA County area [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=642.3000000000001s)]
*  with over 90 containers broken into every day. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=645.34s)]
*  So I guess they didn't clean up the railroad tracks. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=651.1800000000001s)]
*  $12 billion and disorder got worse. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=653.78s)]
*  But of course, allowing people to live outside [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=656.5400000000001s)]
*  and defecate outside in public places [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=659.98s)]
*  and use drugs outside in front of our children [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=662.74s)]
*  is both the cause and a symptom [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=665.94s)]
*  of growing disorder and chaos. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=668.66s)]
*  It's the degradation of what holds us together [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=670.62s)]
*  as a civilization. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=673.3000000000001s)]
*  So our producers are back in LA right now [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=675.78s)]
*  shooting a documentary for season two [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=677.54s)]
*  of our Tucker Carlson original series on Fox Nation. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=679.02s)]
*  It's gonna be out soon. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=681.0600000000001s)]
*  You're seeing some of the footage on your screen right now. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=682.3000000000001s)]
*  What you're seeing now was shot this morning on Skid Row. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=683.94s)]
*  Skid Row in LA is a 50 block neighborhood east of downtown. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=686.38s)]
*  And it's hard to overstate just how dystopian it is. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=690.58s)]
*  You should go for yourself sometime and drive through, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=692.74s)]
*  roll them up, but watch. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=694.46s)]
*  You will not believe this is America, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=696.5s)]
*  the country you grew up in. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=698.82s)]
*  This is what California got for $12 billion. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=700.42s)]
*  Not fewer homeless, just better funded homeless [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=704.62s)]
*  and thousands more of them. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=708.1s)]
*  So like COVID and OxyContin and virtually everything else [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=710.38s)]
*  that's wrecking the country our ancestors built, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=713.7s)]
*  this is a manufactured crisis. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=715.82s)]
*  It didn't happen by accident. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=718.98s)]
*  People paid for it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=720.98s)]
*  In New York, officials have given drug addicts priority [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=723.0600000000001s)]
*  over virtually everyone else in the city. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=725.38s)]
*  A lot of working poor in New York. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=727.66s)]
*  We ought to be celebrating them. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=729.38s)]
*  The city isn't, it's ignoring them. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=731.14s)]
*  In 2015, the annual budget of the New York City [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=733.58s)]
*  Department of Homeless Services was 950 million. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=736.34s)]
*  This year, it's double that. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=740.02s)]
*  It's about $2 billion. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, how much is that? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=744.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, what they're spending on the homeless in New York City [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=745.98s)]
*  is more than the city's entire public university system. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=749.34s)]
*  More than they get to educate far more people. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=753.1800000000001s)]
*  So the homeless are getting more per student [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=756.0600000000001s)]
*  to live outside and smoke meth. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=758.04s)]
*  Is that creating fewer homeless? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=761.4200000000001s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=763.3000000000001s)]
*  In fact, New York's homeless population [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=764.34s)]
*  is now at its highest level since the Great Depression. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=766.26s)]
*  So where's all this money going specifically? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=769.82s)]
*  Now we could do five hours on this, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=771.96s)]
*  but here's just one example. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=773.66s)]
*  That money is going to an overdose prevention center. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=775.16s)]
*  Preventing overdoses, which in fact means [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=778.8s)]
*  helping the homeless get high. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  Officially called an overdose prevention center, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=784.2199999999999s)]
*  it's a place where users can snort, smoke, swallow, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=786.92s)]
*  or inject illegal drugs in a controlled environment. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=790.04s)]
*  Two centers in East Harlem and Washington Heights [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=793.18s)]
*  are the first in the nation to allow supervised drug use. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=795.56s)]
*  The head of an East Harlem community organization [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=798.8s)]
*  says the facility and a nearby methadone clinic [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=801.0s)]
*  have led to an unwanted influx of addicts. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=803.56s)]
*  They all come here from different areas of the city. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=806.16s)]
*  We never had this around here. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  No matter how bad it was through the 60s, all of that, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  we never had this around here. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=813.8199999999999s)]
*  It's pretty funny watching people look confused [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  as they see this. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=818.8s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=819.64s)]
*  I don't remember this. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=820.4599999999999s)]
*  It's not complicated at all. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  It couldn't be simpler. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=824.2399999999999s)]
*  Politicians are making it much easier [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=826.0999999999999s)]
*  to be a homeless drug addict in the United States [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=828.64s)]
*  and much harder to be a law-abiding member [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=831.6s)]
*  of the middle class. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=833.96s)]
*  What's the effect? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=835.46s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=836.32s)]
*  The middle class is dying [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=837.16s)]
*  and we now have record numbers of drug addicted vagrants. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=838.72s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=842.34s)]
*  It tells you that incentives work. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=843.5600000000001s)]
*  If you destroy the nuclear family, which they have, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=845.86s)]
*  if you decriminalize drugs, which they have, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=848.0600000000001s)]
*  if you hand out tents and needles to addicts, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=849.88s)]
*  what do you think's gonna happen? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=852.9200000000001s)]
*  You're gonna get more addicts living in tents. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=854.72s)]
*  Again, it's not complicated. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=856.9s)]
*  This is not a vexing public policy question [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=858.4s)]
*  that requires the Brookings Institution to investigate. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=860.6s)]
*  It's not like fixing social security. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=863.4s)]
*  And the solution is as simple as the problem. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=866.16s)]
*  Here's the solution. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  Stop putting up with it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=869.64s)]
*  Say no. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  No, you can't smoke meth in the park. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=871.84s)]
*  You're not allowed to crap on the sidewalk. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=874.5s)]
*  Pull up your pants and get the hell out of here. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=876.52s)]
*  Go somewhere with lower standards. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=878.6800000000001s)]
*  Head for a place where politicians [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=880.84s)]
*  don't care about their people, because we do care. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=882.38s)]
*  And that's why we're hauling your tent to a landfill [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=885.08s)]
*  and cutting off your checks today. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=887.62s)]
*  You are a drug addict. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=889.42s)]
*  Get a job or leave. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=891.14s)]
*  This is our city. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  You are not allowed to wreck it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=893.92s)]
*  You didn't build it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=895.2199999999999s)]
*  Now, that's not hard. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=897.4599999999999s)]
*  That works. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=898.8199999999999s)]
*  We know it works because that's how societies function [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=899.9s)]
*  for about 2,000 years. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=902.4399999999999s)]
*  If you're an unmarried man with no job, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=904.3399999999999s)]
*  you were not allowed to destroy things. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=906.4599999999999s)]
*  It wasn't your right. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=908.9s)]
*  By the way, this is how successful families [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=910.78s)]
*  still operate to this day in the privacy of their own homes [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=912.66s)]
*  when the NGOs aren't watching. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=915.5799999999999s)]
*  Parents reward good behavior [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=917.18s)]
*  and they do not tolerate bad behavior. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=919.9399999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=921.78s)]
*  Because if you let your kids smoke weed [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=922.62s)]
*  at the breakfast table, they will. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=924.14s)]
*  So you don't let them. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=926.3s)]
*  So why not apply the same standard [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=927.8599999999999s)]
*  to the drug addicts at Penn Station? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=929.54s)]
*  Because what we're doing now is compassionate. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=931.8599999999999s)]
*  It's an attack on civilization. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=933.8599999999999s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DREmnsungVM&t=936.06s)]
