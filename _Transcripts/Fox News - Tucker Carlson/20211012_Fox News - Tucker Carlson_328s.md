# Tucker: Maybe the government has less power than they think
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo)
*  We spend a lot of time on the show talking about ideology, what people believe, but in the end, the measure of a government is not its ideas, it's the effects of its policies on you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=0.0s)]
*  Can you walk around the mall without getting mugged? Can you send your kids to school with the hope that they will be educated? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=12.0s)]
*  Can you run your air conditioning in the summer without worrying there's going to be a brownout because the electrical grid has been so degraded by bad policies? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=22.0s)]
*  Those are the things. Can you take a Southwest Airlines flight to go see your family? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=30.0s)]
*  When those things start to become impossible, you know you've got bad government. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=35.0s)]
*  Well, over the weekend, a lot of American air travelers found out things are falling apart. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=40.0s)]
*  Southwest Airlines canceled probably half of their flights this weekend. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=45.0s)]
*  Now, why did that happen? Well, we told you last night the truth about why it happened. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=48.0s)]
*  We know the truth because we've spoken to people who are directly involved in it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=53.0s)]
*  Pilots at Southwest Airlines are facing a vaccine mandate. They will be fired right before Christmas if they don't submit to medicine they don't want to take. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=56.0s)]
*  A lot of them have already recovered from COVID. They don't need the vaccines, but the Biden administration is forcing them anyway. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=65.0s)]
*  And so this weekend, a lot of them didn't show up for work. That used to be called civil disobedience. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=70.0s)]
*  But that's what's actually happening. That happened this weekend. There's no doubt about it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=75.0s)]
*  And the fact that virtually everyone in charge is lying about it tells you a lot. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=80.0s)]
*  It tells you on the one hand they don't want to own up to the results of their policies, their reckless, crazy policies, which are in effect a power grab and not public health. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=84.0s)]
*  But it also tells you they're very worried because when ordinary people realize they have power too, especially people with skills, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=93.0s)]
*  people who do things most people can't do like fly airplanes or run air traffic control centers, when they realize simply by not doing those things, they can be heard. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=100.0s)]
*  Maybe the government has less power than they think they do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=111.0s)]
*  So for the past 24 hours, you've seen the usual liar stand up and shout us down. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=114.0s)]
*  Oh, no, that's not what happened. It was weather that somehow only affected Southwest Airlines. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=119.0s)]
*  You heard the CEO of Southwest Airlines go on television and tell that lie. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=126.0s)]
*  His name is Gary Kelly. He's under an awful lot of pressure. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=131.0s)]
*  So maybe he had to lie, but he definitely lied. He went on TV today and said, oh, no, it had nothing to do with Biden's vaccine mandates. Watch. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=134.0s)]
*  Seeming a lot of people invested in this idea that this is somehow related to vaccine mandates. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=143.0s)]
*  There's just no evidence of that. You know, as I said, and as Captain Murray said, our people are working very hard. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=149.0s)]
*  They're doing a great job. I'm very proud of them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=156.0s)]
*  And especially when we get into a difficult situation like this, they're also delayed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=159.0s)]
*  They're also ending up in places that they didn't expect. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=164.0s)]
*  So, no, our people are doing a phenomenal job. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=168.0s)]
*  Well, your people are doing a phenomenal job standing up for what they believe in the face of tyranny. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=173.0s)]
*  But to say there's no evidence this was the result, a direct reaction to Joe Biden vaccine mandates is a lie. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=179.0s)]
*  And you know it's a lie if you know anything about the company you run and doubtless he does. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=186.0s)]
*  Later in the same interview, Gary Kelly of Southwest made it clear that Biden's mandate is the only reason he's forcing his employees to get the shot or be fired. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=191.0s)]
*  And the vaccine mandate obviously is controversial. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=201.0s)]
*  And it's not anything that that I wish for our company. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=205.0s)]
*  This is a government mandate. It's a presidential order. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=209.0s)]
*  And we're doing our best to comply with that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=213.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a government mandate. That would be the same government that is ignoring its own laws, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=217.0s)]
*  that is ignoring federal immigration law and allowing the rest of the world into our country unchecked. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=222.0s)]
*  That's a violation of the law. The Biden administration is abetting illegal behavior. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=228.0s)]
*  So for the CEO of a company to say we must follow the law as directed by an administration that is violating the law on a mass scale is a little much. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=233.0s)]
*  And everyone knows it. Lying, lying, lying. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=243.0s)]
*  Well, the governor of Texas, to his great credit, Greg Abbott, just banned vaccine mandates in the state. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=248.0s)]
*  Southwest is headquartered in Texas. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=253.0s)]
*  And yet Southwest and now American Airlines and IBM have announced they will defy Greg Abbott's ban. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=255.0s)]
*  Oh, they're more afraid of Joe Biden than they are of Greg Abbott. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=261.0s)]
*  Let's hope that changes. Over at the White House, by the way, Joe Biden's top flack was doing what she does every day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=265.0s)]
*  Lying, lying, lying. Here are more lies about what happened at Southwest. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=270.0s)]
*  I know there was a little hubbub over the course of the last few days about Southwest Airlines. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=275.0s)]
*  We now know that some of those claims were absolutely false and actually the issues were completely unrelated to vaccine mandates. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=281.0s)]
*  Oh, you lie. They were not completely unrelated to vaccine mandates. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=291.0s)]
*  Talk to the people who called in sick. They were a direct result of the vaccine mandates. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=295.0s)]
*  You did this, Joe Biden, White House. You are wrecking our interstate travel system. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=300.0s)]
*  And over Christmas, you're going to make it impossible for people to travel. You did that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=308.0s)]
*  And at some point, it's going to be very obvious to the whole country. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKXzEN4jMo&t=312.0s)]
