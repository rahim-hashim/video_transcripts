# The left has run out of 'arrows in their quiver:' Steele
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM)
*  Shelby Steele is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=0.0s)]
*  and the writer of What Killed Michael Brown. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=2.4s)]
*  Shelby Steele joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=4.24s)]
*  Mr. Steele, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  As noted, I think that the democratic theory [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=8.56s)]
*  about replacing the electorate is actually wrong. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  I think they're not getting what they think they're getting, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=16.32s)]
*  which is kind of amusing, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=18.88s)]
*  but the whole notion is offensive to me. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=20.28s)]
*  Shouldn't the purpose of a government be, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=22.48s)]
*  its only real purpose is to please and enhance the lives [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=25.6s)]
*  of the people who live there, of its citizens? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=29.48s)]
*  Indeed, indeed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=33.68s)]
*  It's hard, it's, you know, they seem to have no other, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=36.84s)]
*  no more arrows in their quiver to fight with, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  to struggle with, and so they're reduced [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  to sort of scraping around for these, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=47.96s)]
*  for actually these tragedies, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=50.36s)]
*  like what happened at Buffalo, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=52.68s)]
*  as something that you can turn from tragedy to power. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=55.24s)]
*  I think it's ultimately, probably always, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=60.08s)]
*  very often about power and whatever narrative [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=64.28s)]
*  or scenario grabs power is what they do, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  no matter whether it makes logical sense or not. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  But at an awfully high cost, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=77.24s)]
*  I mean, it does feel like the social fabric is fraying, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=78.88s)]
*  the country's really volatile, you can feel it, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=81.64s)]
*  just walking around, it's really obvious, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=83.8s)]
*  and so into a country like that, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=85.76s)]
*  to throw something like this and to say, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=88.12s)]
*  "'See, they hate you so much, they'll kill you,' [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=89.72s)]
*  seems like a pretty reckless thing to say. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=91.8s)]
*  It indeed is reckless to say, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=96.92s)]
*  and I'm not altogether sure what it is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=101.12s)]
*  that makes them skip over reality, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=106.52s)]
*  it's so happy to skip over reality [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  to these sort of fantasy charges that they make. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=111.28s)]
*  But they obviously get us nowhere. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=116.72s)]
*  They're, at this point, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=118.64s)]
*  they're almost willing to do anything. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=124.8s)]
*  They seem to have very few, very minimal scruples [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=126.88s)]
*  about how to move forward in American life at this point. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=130.32s)]
*  My own little humble opinion is, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=135.96s)]
*  I've written a good bit about it, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=139.32s)]
*  is that one of the great forces, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=141.76s)]
*  one of the most powerful forces in American life today [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=144.4s)]
*  is white guilt. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=147.8s)]
*  And guilt puts sort of, you have to seem to be going [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=150.4s)]
*  against your own self-interest to gain that expiation, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=154.32s)]
*  that redemption that white guilt basically seems to long for. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=158.8s)]
*  And it seems to me that they're caught in that, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=165.08s)]
*  and at this point, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=167.84s)]
*  and it's taking us nowhere. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=171.04s)]
*  You can't resolve guilt. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=175.6s)]
*  No, you can't, except in church. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=177.32s)]
*  I mean, it does seem like organized religion [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=180.0s)]
*  is a much healthier outlet for impulses like that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=181.68s)]
*  Absolutely, that's where the human condition always goes, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=185.68s)]
*  is to religion, as we should. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=190.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=192.24s)]
*  That's one of the reasons it's there, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=194.68s)]
*  and human beings do that all over the world. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=196.96s)]
*  But the left in America today is not doing that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=201.12s)]
*  They're spinning out another sort of dream vision, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  dreamscape, to sort of rewrite them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Part of the problem that I think that's happened [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=215.44s)]
*  to the left is that they have no, they've become exhausted. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=217.68s)]
*  Their ideas have gotten, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=221.88s)]
*  we've been driven by those ideas now [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=224.72s)]
*  since at least the 60s. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=227.0s)]
*  They fail unrelentingly. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=228.96s)]
*  I mean, they fail with a kind of absolute precision. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's where they're at, they're desperate. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a nihilism in the face of those failures. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=240.4s)]
*  I think it's a really insightful point. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  Shelby Steele, I appreciate your coming on very much. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=246.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=248.0s)]
*  We'll be back with more stories that are changing the world [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=254.52s)]
*  and changing your life. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=257.24s)]
*  I'm Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkH3IvPzcUM&t=258.84000000000003s)]
