# Gov. Abbott mobilizes National Guard as border crisis spirals out of control
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c)
*  Governor of the state of Texas, Greg Abbott, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=0.0s)]
*  has mobilized the Texas National Guard [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=2.04s)]
*  to protect the sovereignty of this country [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  and of his state. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=6.04s)]
*  The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=7.4s)]
*  joins us now to explain what he's doing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=8.68s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=11.0s)]
*  Thank you for doing this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=13.48s)]
*  If you don't mind, if you'd give our viewers an overview [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=14.84s)]
*  of what you've done to secure your border with Mexico. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=17.36s)]
*  I'll tell you exactly what we are doing, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=20.68s)]
*  but I want to emphasize a phrase you used earlier, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=22.44s)]
*  and that is the Biden administration [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=24.72s)]
*  is actively encouraging this, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=26.2s)]
*  which is in contrast to what the Trump administration did. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=27.8s)]
*  So once the Biden administration has taken over [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=30.92s)]
*  what Texas has done, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=32.96s)]
*  we now have 6,500 National Guard and DPS troopers [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=34.4s)]
*  on the border to help secure the border. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=39.24s)]
*  And as we're talking right now, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=41.92s)]
*  they are identifying locations on the border [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  where they are laying down razor wire [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=45.88s)]
*  to secure all the possible crossings [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=49.0s)]
*  that these caravans may be coming to. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=51.28s)]
*  And then in addition to that, beginning today, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=53.72s)]
*  we begin dropping these large containers [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=56.4s)]
*  that you see on 18 wheelers, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=59.56s)]
*  that you also see on these ships [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=60.8s)]
*  that are going across the ocean. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=62.6s)]
*  We're dropping them down on locations [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=64.28s)]
*  that could be crossings that would be used by these caravans [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=66.52s)]
*  to serve as a blockade [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=69.48s)]
*  to prevent them from coming across the border. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=71.2s)]
*  And then on top of that, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=73.16s)]
*  if they do come across the border, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=74.68s)]
*  the National Guard and the Texas Department of Public Safety, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=76.72s)]
*  they are authorized to arrest any of these people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=79.0s)]
*  who make it through our blockade efforts [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=81.84s)]
*  and put them in jail for violating a crime [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  of criminal trespass in the state of Texas. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  And Tucker, on top of that, Texas is stepping up [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=89.56s)]
*  and we are building our own border wall. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=93.44s)]
*  That process has already begun. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=95.64s)]
*  We're in the process of getting bids on it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=97.4s)]
*  And I'm told to expect part of the Texas wall [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=99.12s)]
*  to be completed before the end of this calendar year. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=102.2s)]
*  Amen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=106.84s)]
*  When the country falls apart, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=107.76s)]
*  states have to act like country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=108.76s)]
*  So you're the chief executive of a state [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  whose sovereignty is being violated by foreign nationals, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=112.24s)]
*  many of whom are not even from nearby country, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  not even Latin American, they're from around the world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=116.24s)]
*  It seems you're doing a sensible thing, the only thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=119.08s)]
*  What kind of pushback do you expect to get [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=121.52s)]
*  from the Biden administration for doing this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=123.64s)]
*  Listen, the Biden administration has been pushing back [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=126.56s)]
*  every step of the way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=129.2s)]
*  Among other things that I did, Tucker, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=130.48s)]
*  I issued an order preventing any of the NGOs [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  or other assistant aides in the state of Texas [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  from transporting or moving any illegal immigrant [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=139.48s)]
*  within the state of Texas because of healthcare reasons, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=142.96s)]
*  because of possible spread of COVID. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=145.72s)]
*  The Biden administration sued me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=147.72s)]
*  They went to federal court. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=149.6s)]
*  They got a federal court to rule [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=150.88s)]
*  that my executive order was unconstitutional. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=152.72s)]
*  I will continue to act, however, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=155.44s)]
*  but it just goes to show the level of pushback [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=157.12s)]
*  by the Biden administration, even trying to deny me [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=159.56s)]
*  to protect the health and safety of my fellow Texans. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=162.84s)]
*  You've had hundreds and hundreds of thousands [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=165.72s)]
*  of people come from other countries, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=167.6s)]
*  illegally through Texas, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=169.36s)]
*  and then coming to the interior of the United States. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=170.56s)]
*  To what degree can you staunch the flow [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=173.68s)]
*  of people coming in illegally, do you think? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=176.4s)]
*  So the best way we can do that is the strategies [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=179.56s)]
*  that we're employing as we speak right now, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=182.32s)]
*  and that is to identify all of these locations [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=184.12s)]
*  where they may be coming across, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=186.6s)]
*  and they're called low water crossing areas, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=187.88s)]
*  and then to serve as block aides in those regions [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=190.6s)]
*  so that we will be preventing the people [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=193.8s)]
*  from coming across the border. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=195.96s)]
*  I have to ask you, since you deal with this every day, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=199.56s)]
*  what do you think the Biden administration's motive is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=201.52s)]
*  in throwing open our borders to the world? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=203.96s)]
*  It's clear, kind of what you were talking about earlier. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=207.8s)]
*  Joe Biden believes in open border policies [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=211.0s)]
*  and his administration do, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=213.84s)]
*  and they are truly trying to redesign [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=215.36s)]
*  the United States of America in a complete lawless way. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=218.08s)]
*  They talked about this on the campaign trail [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=222.28s)]
*  when all the Democrats were on the same debate stage [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=224.04s)]
*  talking about quite literally these socialistic policies [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=226.0s)]
*  they would employ in the United States, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=228.88s)]
*  which mimic Acacia Cortez and her acolytes, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=230.72s)]
*  and they are acting out on all of those policies [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=234.04s)]
*  and promises they made during the campaign. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=236.12s)]
*  That leaves it to the states now to step up [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  and do everything we can to hold on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=240.92s)]
*  to the United States of America [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=243.28s)]
*  until Republicans can regain control [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=244.84s)]
*  of Congress and the presidency. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=247.0s)]
*  Yeah, with new attitudes, I hope, too. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=249.28s)]
*  You're certainly protecting the rest of us by doing this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  We appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=253.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWnoJiKT-c&t=254.04s)]
