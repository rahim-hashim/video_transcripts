# Kyle Rittenhouse responds to media coverage of trial
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4)
*  Gage Grosskreutz stuck a loaded gun in your face. Yes. Yeah, he's never been charged for that. He hasn't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=0.0s)]
*  He I told him I was going to the police and he pointed a gun at my head and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  I from what I remember time slowed down. I just remember staring down the barrel of a pistol thinking I'm about to die and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=15.32s)]
*  He hasn't been charged with a single crime in what's really disturbing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=25.2s)]
*  Is that his DUI case was dropped right before my trial so my attorneys couldn't ask him about it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=30.0s)]
*  That's my belief but his his open DUI case for driving under the influence [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=38.84s)]
*  Was closed a week before my trial [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=44.8s)]
*  Does it surprise you to see him described as a hero as he has been in so many press accounts? I [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Don't I don't see him as a in my opinion, there's no winners in this case. There's no heroes in this case [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  I defended myself. I was attacked. I think it's actually quite sickening how mr. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=61.0s)]
*  Huber and mr. Grosskreutz are described as heroes when it's on video that they attempted to they attempted to murder me in the middle of the streets [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=66.8s)]
*  So what's the message you think the media are sending by describing them as heroes? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  The message I get from it is that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=80.36s)]
*  They're saying you can go out and riot and attack anybody and you will have the support from the media and the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=83.36s)]
*  Politicians to do whatever you want and kill innocent people and if they defend yourself you're named a hero [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=90.4s)]
*  That's the message. I believe is being spread [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=96.28s)]
*  It's scary [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Do you have any idea like were you interested in politics before this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this, but I was a pretty big Andrew Yang supporter before all of this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=108.12s)]
*  Were you really? Yeah, you're part of the Yang gang. I was part of the Yang gang [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=113.64s)]
*  I like you. Yeah, he's a good dude [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=117.68s)]
*  But I wasn't really into politics. I didn't know much about Trump. I didn't know much about Biden [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=121.08s)]
*  I just knew I went to a Trump rally because Trump supports the police. He's a businessman. That's what I liked about Trump [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=126.72s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know much about politics. I was just [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=133.68s)]
*  17 year old kid, but you liked Andrew Yang. I liked Andrew Yang. I eat I liked his policy a little bit [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=136.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, he's he's very smart interesting guy very intelligent. So has this changed for politics. I [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=143.6s)]
*  Don't know I've been trying to stay out of politics. Yeah, lately like [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=151.24s)]
*  It's no matter what direction I'm gonna go [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=155.92s)]
*  There's gonna be people that don't support me no matter what so I think it's just my best interest to avoid politics because I'm not a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=158.0s)]
*  Political person. I'm just a person who was attacked and defended myself [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHjyeeBkx4&t=165.66s)]
