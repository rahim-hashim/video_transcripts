# Tucker: Canadian Catholic school student arrested for saying men and women are different
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8)
*  Not many Americans pay attention to Canada. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=0.0s)]
*  The entire country could disappear [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=2.6s)]
*  and it wouldn't make the nightly news here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=4.04s)]
*  But we watch what's happening in Canada [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=6.9s)]
*  because it's fascinating. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=8.48s)]
*  How could such a nice country [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=9.3s)]
*  become totalitarian so quickly? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=10.48s)]
*  Are there lessons for us? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=13.14s)]
*  Well, for example, a high school student in Canada [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=14.96s)]
*  has been arrested for declaring [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=17.28s)]
*  that men and women are different. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=20.1s)]
*  Josh Alexander attended St. Joseph's High School, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=21.86s)]
*  Catholic High School in Renfrew, Ontario. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=24.44s)]
*  He was barred from school, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  from the grounds for saying that God created two genders [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=28.52s)]
*  because that's kind of a Christian precept, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=31.32s)]
*  but also common sense. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=32.88s)]
*  When he showed up for class, police arrested him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=34.28s)]
*  You can see it on your screen right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=36.18s)]
*  So we thought it'd be worth talking to him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=37.64s)]
*  And now we are. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=39.44s)]
*  Josh Alexander and his lawyer, James Kitchen, join us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=40.28s)]
*  Thanks to you both for coming on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=43.64s)]
*  Josh, first to you, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  you were arrested because you showed up on campus [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  at a Catholic school for saying [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  that men and women are different. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Have we overstated that? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=53.66s)]
*  No, that's exactly what happened. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=55.92s)]
*  There was a lot of steps that it took to get to that point, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  but female students complained to me [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=61.6s)]
*  and they said they were concerned [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=63.92s)]
*  because males were using their washrooms. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=65.76s)]
*  This turned into a debate at the school [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=67.76s)]
*  and I stated my opinion on it [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=69.84s)]
*  and I used scripture to back that up [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  and they removed me from the building [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  for the remainder of the year. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=77.08s)]
*  And when I attempted to attend class, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=78.4s)]
*  I was arrested and charged. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=80.2s)]
*  Did you point out that this is a Christian school [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=83.32s)]
*  and that this is like a core Christian idea [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=86.6s)]
*  because it's like in the Christian book, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  which some call the Bible? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=90.32s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=93.36s)]
*  I actually tried to have that discussion [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=94.24s)]
*  with my administrators, but they refused to do so. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=96.58s)]
*  Mr. Kitchen, my apologies, by the way, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=101.16s)]
*  on what's happened to your, I think, great country. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=103.52s)]
*  What's your recourse legally in Canada? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=107.24s)]
*  Well, it's limited, of course, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=110.2s)]
*  because our constitution is much weaker [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=111.76s)]
*  and because there seems to be culturally and legally [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=114.44s)]
*  much less respect for individual rights and freedoms [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=117.52s)]
*  and much more interest in government [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=119.52s)]
*  having the kind of power to do what it wants. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=122.72s)]
*  But there is recourse to the Ontario Human Rights Commission [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=125.16s)]
*  in this case. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=128.0s)]
*  We think there's been religious discrimination [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=128.84s)]
*  on the basis of Josh's Christian religious beliefs, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=130.52s)]
*  so we're gonna file a complaint [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=132.44s)]
*  to the Ontario Human Rights Commission. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=133.84s)]
*  And there is recourse through the board itself [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=135.76s)]
*  as far as appealing these disciplinary decisions, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=137.88s)]
*  and we hope to explore that as well. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=140.16s)]
*  I mean, Fidel Castro's son takes over your country [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=142.88s)]
*  and all of a sudden it becomes Cuba? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=145.28s)]
*  Like, it's just shocking. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=146.76s)]
*  Josh, quickly to you, the police officers [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=147.88s)]
*  who arrested you, a high school student, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=150.48s)]
*  for quoting the Bible in a Christian school, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=152.28s)]
*  must have been ashamed of themselves, I would hope. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=154.44s)]
*  Did they seem embarrassed? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=156.68s)]
*  I wouldn't say so. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  I've had a lot of experience with police [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=161.6s)]
*  over the last couple of years, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  just through the Freedom Convoy [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=165.0s)]
*  and other events like that, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=166.44s)]
*  and the police state is quite embarrassing in our country, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=167.24s)]
*  so there was no different response from them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=170.04s)]
*  Are you gonna continue high school? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=174.0s)]
*  I'm certainly gonna try to. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=177.6s)]
*  I would hope that my personal beliefs [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=179.0s)]
*  wouldn't exclude me from an education, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=180.8s)]
*  but it would appear that's the way it's gonna be. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  It's an unbelievable story. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=186.32s)]
*  I hope you'll both come back. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=187.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Josh Alexander, James Kitchener. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  Josh, our nightly opens, stories that are changing the world [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=196.4s)]
*  and changing your life. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=199.96s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaG8JYiiZK8&t=201.64000000000001s)]
