# Tucker: Maybe this isn't a crazy idea
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Monday. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=3.5s)]
*  Here's something we just saw, I wish we brought it to you earlier. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=4.5s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky, the president of Ukraine of course, gave an interview recently that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=6.5s)]
*  didn't get enough attention in this country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=10.44s)]
*  Zelensky, needless to say, is currently engaged in a desperate fight for his country, his [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  government, his life. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=17.34s)]
*  And he has been since the Russian military invaded Ukraine nearly three weeks ago. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=18.34s)]
*  So you can assume there's not a lot Zelensky thinks about at this point apart from getting [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=22.14s)]
*  the Russians off of Ukrainian soil. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=26.26s)]
*  So last week Zelensky floated the idea of accepting so-called Ukrainian neutrality, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=29.7s)]
*  agreeing not to join NATO. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=34.46s)]
*  In exchange for that, he would get a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=36.12s)]
*  Now there's nothing inherently controversial about Zelensky's idea. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=39.7s)]
*  Ukraine was not on the cusp of joining NATO anyway. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=44.22s)]
*  NATO officials have long said they don't want Ukraine to join. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=46.26s)]
*  It's not clear whose interest would be served by Ukraine joining NATO. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  So if accepting the status quo, going with the way things already were and were always [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=53.82s)]
*  If doing that convinces Putin to stop killing Ukrainians and spares Ukraine from total and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  complete destruction, maybe it's not a crazy idea. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=64.16s)]
*  Maybe Zelensky is on to something. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=67.78s)]
*  He certainly thought about it a lot. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=69.54s)]
*  Maybe we ought to congratulate Zelensky for acting wisely on behalf of the country he [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=71.42s)]
*  leads. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=76.14s)]
*  This could be a win for him and for the entire world. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=77.14s)]
*  Probably not a lot of American media outlets will describe it that way, however. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  Indeed, by mentioning NATO, a topic that is completely off limits in American media, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=84.58s)]
*  Zelensky may have gone too far. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=89.94s)]
*  Daily, in every possible venue, we are told that NATO is paradoxically both of its central [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=92.3s)]
*  importance to the United States and at the same time irrelevant to what happens in Eastern [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=97.66s)]
*  Europe. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=103.06s)]
*  So years of talk about expanding NATO into Ukraine, and we've watched those happen in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  public, that had nothing whatsoever to do with Russia invading Ukraine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=108.98s)]
*  Nothing at all. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=114.58s)]
*  That's what they tell us. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=115.58s)]
*  Putin invaded Ukraine because he's bad. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=116.58s)]
*  End of conversation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=119.94s)]
*  And anyone who says otherwise, anyone who suggests there might be a way out of this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=121.34s)]
*  disaster short of total war, anyone who says that is immediately denounced as a tool of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=124.66s)]
*  Russian propaganda. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=131.46s)]
*  It means that by acknowledging that NATO expansion is what Putin seems to care about most, Zelensky [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=132.74s)]
*  is, by definition, at least in this country, repeating Russian talking points. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=139.18s)]
*  That would make the president of Ukraine a Putin collaborator. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=144.22s)]
*  Sound insane? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, then you can still think clearly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  But that's the state of play. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=152.82s)]
*  How do we know this? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=153.82s)]
*  Let's just say we've lived it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=155.42s)]
*  We've made the point repeatedly that forcing Ukraine into NATO will in no way serve the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=157.74s)]
*  interests of the United States and in fact could hurt us here in ways from which we will [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=163.26s)]
*  never recover. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=168.42s)]
*  And by the way, talking about it doesn't seem to have helped Ukraine either. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  For saying that, and that's all we've said, here's the reaction we've received. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=175.22s)]
*  And this is just a small selection. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=179.7s)]
*  We could do a full hour on it, but here's a clip. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  What seems to be almost the Putin wing of the Republican Party, which, to be fair, is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=184.61999999999998s)]
*  not prevalent much on Capitol Hill, but we've seen Tucker Carlson, you know, basically repeat [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  Russian propaganda night after night. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=197.98s)]
*  What the hell is going on? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=200.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, before they fell in love with Putin, they fell in love with Orban and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=201.98s)]
*  Hungary. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=206.46s)]
*  Make America Great Again meant let's make America more like Hungary. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=207.7s)]
*  And the most popular Republican broadcaster in America, Tucker Carlson, are both unabashed [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=211.5s)]
*  fans of Putin. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=216.82s)]
*  And there are very few Republicans out there like Mitt Romney or Liz Cheney who have the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=218.82s)]
*  courage to call them out. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=223.02s)]
*  This is a disgrace. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=225.02s)]
*  How anybody in this country which loves freedom can side with Vladimir Putin, which is an [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=226.62s)]
*  oppressor, a dictator. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=234.06s)]
*  He kills people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  He imprisons his political opponents. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=239.3s)]
*  He has been an adversary of America at every chance he's had. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=241.94s)]
*  It's unthinkable to be. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=246.82s)]
*  It's almost treasonous. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=248.78s)]
*  Ooh, almost treasonous. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=249.78s)]
*  Siding with Putin. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=252.02s)]
*  Who's siding with Putin? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=253.02s)]
*  I haven't seen anybody do that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=254.02s)]
*  I've seen a few people try to side with the United States. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=255.18s)]
*  And that says Mitt Romney, a man who got four deferments to keep himself out of the Vietnam [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=257.42s)]
*  War. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=261.66s)]
*  That is almost treasonous. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=262.66s)]
*  What's interesting, we don't want to pick on Mitt Romney here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  It's too easy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=267.26s)]
*  But it does seem like if you take a step back, that the very same people who spent the last, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=268.42s)]
*  say, two years telling us that this country, our country, is inherently sinful and racist [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=273.14s)]
*  and disgusting and born in iniquity. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=281.26s)]
*  Those same people, the ones who lecture you about how there's something inherently wrong [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=284.74s)]
*  with you if you live here, were born here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  Those same people have been the very quickest, the very first to whip around and accuse anyone [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  who wants to save the United States from yet another pointless war, a war that they would [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=296.38s)]
*  never fight in and nor with their children, accuse those people of being unpatriotic. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=300.5s)]
*  Well, you don't love America enough, says the man who thinks America is racist. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=305.06s)]
*  How does that work exactly? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=311.02s)]
*  I'm not sure, but in case you've forgotten, here's the very same Mitt Romney, marching [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=313.22s)]
*  with the very same people who told us that this is a white supremacist hellhole. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=317.82000000000005s)]
*  By the way, we've got to do away with a nuclear family. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=322.3s)]
*  That's never done anybody any good. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=324.38000000000005s)]
*  Here he is. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=326.1s)]
*  A way to end violence and brutality and to make sure that people understand that black [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=327.1s)]
*  lives matter. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=333.14000000000004s)]
*  So, okay, it's just Mitt Romney. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  Super ingenious, obviously deep in the grip of some late life crisis, licking his wounds [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=338.94s)]
*  for being beaten by Obama in 2012. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=343.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=346.1s)]
*  But it's not just Mitt Romney. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=347.1s)]
*  Imagine how you would feel if you were a business owner in Kenosha or Minneapolis or Atlanta [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=349.7s)]
*  or Louisville. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=353.98s)]
*  If you were someone who, I don't know, used to go to St. John's Church in Washington, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=354.98s)]
*  D.C. or someone who works in the federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon before BLM torched all [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=358.5s)]
*  of it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=362.58s)]
*  You're long accustomed to knowing that your leaders don't really care about you, but when [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=364.42s)]
*  they reveal that they actively hate you, that's hard to take. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  So, of course, Mitt Romney is debasing himself, degrading himself in order to be liked in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=374.82s)]
*  Washington. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=380.18s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen that, of course, but it's deeper than that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=381.18s)]
*  Needless to say, the people Mitt Romney wants to like in his new masters were not satisfied [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=384.1s)]
*  with him marching with BLM or denouncing his critics as almost treasonous. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=389.78s)]
*  They want more. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  They won't be satisfied until every Republican in the U.S. Senate is wholly indistinguishable [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=396.65999999999997s)]
*  from Chris Hayes. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=401.05999999999995s)]
*  And they're getting pretty close. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=402.53999999999996s)]
*  On Sunday, yesterday, Mitt Romney edged a little closer. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=404.78s)]
*  Here's what he wrote to Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=409.46s)]
*  Now, Tulsi Gabbard is a former member of Congress who currently serves as a lieutenant colonel [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=410.9s)]
*  in the U.S. Army Reserve and, unlike Mitt Romney, has been deployed. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=415.05999999999995s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  Her treasonous lies may well cost lives. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=422.06s)]
*  Treasonous lies have cost lives, potentially. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=427.5s)]
*  So you're betraying your country and committing murder. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=430.58000000000004s)]
*  So what exactly did Tulsi Gabbard do? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  Did she call for a violent overthrow of the United States government? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=436.86s)]
*  Did she come out and pledge allegiance to Putin? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=439.26s)]
*  Did she get a Cyrillic tattoo on her neck? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  No, she didn't. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  What she said is, we have a problem. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=447.74s)]
*  Here's how we know. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=450.14s)]
*  She cited publicly available information and said we should probably deal with that problem. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=451.14s)]
*  But in case you're wondering, Mitt Romney was a consultant, for God's sakes, accusing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=456.38s)]
*  someone who's been in the Army for nearly two decades of treason. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=461.46000000000004s)]
*  People didn't use to talk that way. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=467.7s)]
*  Treason is a death penalty offense. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  It's absurd on its face. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=471.90000000000003s)]
*  But if you watch the video that got Mitt Romney to call a fellow American treasonous and suggest [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=474.26s)]
*  she was committing murder, it really makes your head spin. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=480.26s)]
*  Here's what Tulsi Gabbard actually said that made Mitt Romney accuse her of betraying her [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=485.18s)]
*  own country. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=490.26s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=491.26s)]
*  Here are the undeniable facts. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=492.26s)]
*  There are 25 to 30 U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=495.74s)]
*  According to the U.S. government, these biolabs are conducting research on dangerous pathogens. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=500.26s)]
*  Ukraine is in an active war zone with widespread bombing, artillery, and shelling. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=506.34s)]
*  These facilities, even in the best of circumstances, could easily be compromised and release these [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=512.7s)]
*  deadly pathogens. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=519.06s)]
*  Yeah, she hates our country because she's worried that a pathogen might escape from [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=520.78s)]
*  a biolab and hurt people. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=526.34s)]
*  There's no recent precedent for that, so she's clearly listening to Alex Jones too much and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=530.5s)]
*  she's treasonous. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=534.38s)]
*  Actually, everything that Tulsi Gabbard said, as you know, is true. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=535.74s)]
*  It's not a Republican issue. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=539.42s)]
*  It's not a Democrat issue. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=540.42s)]
*  It's a factual issue. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=541.42s)]
*  And even in war, truth is a defense. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=542.42s)]
*  In fact, it's the only defense. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=544.42s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=545.98s)]
*  And in a free country, you can speak the truth. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=546.98s)]
*  That right can never be taken away or else it's not a free country. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=549.66s)]
*  But by the way, since we're speaking of facts, the director of the U.S. Cooperative Threat [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=553.0s)]
*  a man who would know, a man called Robert Pope, has confirmed that scientists are keeping [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=557.14s)]
*  Soviet-era pathogens for research purposes in Ukraine. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=561.14s)]
*  They told us they were destroying them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=566.26s)]
*  They should have destroyed them, but they haven't. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=567.54s)]
*  What could go wrong in an active war zone? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  And they knew that those pathogens existed and were being experimented upon, researched, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  and they didn't secure them before the Russians invaded, though they knew the Russian invasion [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=580.14s)]
*  because they told us. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=584.84s)]
*  And then Torrey Nuland, the undersecretary of state who oversees this disaster, testified [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=587.4000000000001s)]
*  under oath that, yes, Russian forces might seize those biolabs in Ukraine and we should [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=591.5200000000001s)]
*  all be very worried about that possibility. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=596.34s)]
*  Over the weekend, CBS News reported that Pentagon officials have confirmed that these biolabs [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=599.2800000000001s)]
*  in Ukraine are, in fact, conducting research on anthrax and other, quote, deadly pathogens. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=603.32s)]
*  A man, an official I talked to this morning, said there is no movement of chemical weapons [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=610.44s)]
*  into Ukraine. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=616.44s)]
*  At least they're not seeing the signs of it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=617.44s)]
*  The concern is that the Russians will seize one of these biomedical research facilities [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=620.36s)]
*  that Ukraine has where they do research on deadly pathogens like botulism and anthrax, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=626.6s)]
*  seize one of those facilities, weaponize the pathogen, and then blame it on Ukraine and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=634.6s)]
*  the U.S. because the U.S. has been providing support for some of the research being done [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=641.6s)]
*  in those facilities. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=647.44s)]
*  Okay, so we're a little confused about what all the hyperventilating is about. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=648.44s)]
*  Now, you just heard CBS say and you've heard many say that Russia may seize these biological [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=653.44s)]
*  agents in Ukraine and use them against the Ukrainians and who knows who else. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=658.92s)]
*  Now, you would pause and think, well, wait a second, if these are Soviet-era weapons, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=663.92s)]
*  then presumably the Soviets, now called the Russian government, probably have their own, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=668.5999999999999s)]
*  so why would they want to seize stuff they already have? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=674.24s)]
*  It doesn't actually make a lot of sense, but whatever. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=676.92s)]
*  You'll notice that the reporter you just saw at the beginning of the clip admits that these [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  pathogens are in Ukraine. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=684.5999999999999s)]
*  They're doing research on botulism and anthrax, so any reasonable person would be concerned [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=686.76s)]
*  by that because there's a war going on. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  And by the way, why were they funding this in Ukraine in the first place? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=694.16s)]
*  But that's really a secondary question. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=696.4799999999999s)]
*  Maybe we can get to the bottom of that when the war's over. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=698.12s)]
*  But Tulsi Gabbard addressed and only addressed the danger that innocent people could die [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=700.4s)]
*  because these weapons, apparently these pathogens, these agents exist in Ukraine. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=707.92s)]
*  She didn't blame it on Russia. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=711.88s)]
*  She didn't blame anybody. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=712.88s)]
*  She just said, this is the thing. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=713.92s)]
*  Unsecured bio-weapons in a war zone are a bad idea. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=716.12s)]
*  That's not reasonable now? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=719.28s)]
*  That's treason? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=720.48s)]
*  Reason isn't part of the way people are thinking now. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=723.52s)]
*  Everybody in leadership has completely lost the ability to think beyond the next tweet. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=728.16s)]
*  Who is thinking about tomorrow or next month or 20 years from now? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=732.2s)]
*  Not one person. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=735.76s)]
*  And anyone who tries is an agent of Putin. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=736.76s)]
*  Now to a story of Russian disinformation that has been quickly embraced and amplified by [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=741.0s)]
*  some in America's right-wing media. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=746.96s)]
*  When State Department Undersecretary Victoria Nuland confirmed this week that there was [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=749.0s)]
*  bio-research going on in Ukraine, critics say that Tucker Carlson of Fox News took those [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=753.08s)]
*  remarks out of context. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=758.36s)]
*  Now you see the Chinese government kind of openly repeating Russian propaganda, for example, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=760.28s)]
*  about these supposed American bio labs in Ukraine. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=766.92s)]
*  This Russian misinformation about bio labs in Ukraine. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=771.36s)]
*  People on the Trump right who are actually parroting Russian propaganda every day and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=776.4799999999999s)]
*  every night. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=782.4s)]
*  These supposed bio labs. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=786.04s)]
*  Well the US government says they have bio labs and told us under oath that they're worried [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  about the contents of these bio labs which they failed to secure might get into the wrong [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=793.24s)]
*  hands. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=798.32s)]
*  But it's right-wing Putinite propaganda. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=799.32s)]
*  We're taking Nuland's remarks out of context. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=803.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, what's the right context? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  We asked. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=806.64s)]
*  No one told us. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=807.64s)]
*  Robert Pope's remarks. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=809.0400000000001s)]
*  Were they taken out of context too? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=810.0400000000001s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=812.4000000000001s)]
*  There's a problem. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=814.32s)]
*  Before we even assign blame to the problem, it might be worth thinking through how to [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=815.9200000000001s)]
*  fix the problem. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=820.72s)]
*  But no. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=822.68s)]
*  Anyone who mentions it should shut up. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=824.64s)]
*  And not just shut up. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=828.16s)]
*  Be shut up by force if necessary. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=829.78s)]
*  With jail time. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=832.8399999999999s)]
*  Now we're going to do something we almost never do. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=834.7199999999999s)]
*  We're going to play you a clip from The View which is now calling for Department of Justice [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=836.2399999999999s)]
*  investigation into this show and Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=841.4s)]
*  Watch. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=844.0s)]
*  What Tucker Carlson parrots every night on Fox News, what Tulsi Gabbard is spreading [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=845.0s)]
*  helping Putin get away with criminal acts against innocent Ukrainian civilians. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY0P8Tmj73I&t=849.76s)]
