# Veterans skydive in every continent to raise money for families of fallen troops
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA)
*  Now we told you a few minutes ago about several special operations veterans who are undertaking a truly historic effort to skydive in seven continents in seven days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike Glover is now with us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=11.72s)]
*  He will be talking a little bit more about legacy expeditions, which is organizing this effort. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=13.6s)]
*  He has worked with a lot of these guys for a long time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  We had some Mike problems earlier, but they're fixed now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=22.16s)]
*  So I'm glad Mike could stick around and tell us more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=24.72s)]
*  Mike, thank you so much for coming back. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=27.68s)]
*  Talk about the significance of what these guys are doing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=31.68s)]
*  I know they're starting in Antarctica. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=35.8s)]
*  They're on their way there. If they're not there already, where do they go next? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=38.28s)]
*  So they're going to Antarctica and making their way to Chile and to all seven continents culminating in Florida, in Tampa, Florida. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=43.24s)]
*  The overall objective here is to take veterans, special forces and special operations skill sets and inspire Americans to never forget the sacrifice. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  These special operations and people who never had the opportunity to come back, that we should never forget about them and offer the educational benefits, the scholarships through folds of honor for their family members. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=63.76s)]
*  So people can follow along on this historic event and help support this amazing nonprofit and effort to support those who have lost their loved ones. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=78.68s)]
*  Where do they go and how do they do that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=89.2s)]
*  They can go to legacyexpeditions.net. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=91.92s)]
*  That's the primary place where they could donate. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  We've already raised one hundred fifty thousand. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  And like I said before, I'm not sure if you guys heard it, but if we raise seven million dollars, that helps fourteen hundred different families with scholarships. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  For those that their loved one never came back from war. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=108.04s)]
*  So we want to do our best to bring attention to it and breaking a couple of world records is our attempt. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  I appreciate you, Mike, your lifetime of service and those of your brothers who are out on this mission now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  Thank you again. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  And we look forward to following along. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILMqBmdFsA&t=137.36s)]
