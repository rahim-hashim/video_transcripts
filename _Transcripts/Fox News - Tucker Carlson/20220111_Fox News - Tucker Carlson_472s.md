# Tucker: This is not allowed
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, time for civics class, the abbreviated version. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=1.84s)]
*  Here's how democracies work. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  In a democracy, voters strike a highly straightforward deal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=6.24s)]
*  with the government that rules them. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Here's what it is. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=12.08s)]
*  Politicians do their best to improve your life. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  In exchange for that, you vote for them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=16.28s)]
*  That is a voluntary arrangement. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=18.82s)]
*  It works pretty well for 250 years. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=20.72s)]
*  That's how it's worked here in the United States, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=23.32s)]
*  but suddenly not anymore. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=25.52s)]
*  During his entire first year in office, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden did virtually nothing to improve the actual lives [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=29.32s)]
*  of actual American citizens. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=32.68s)]
*  And he didn't because he didn't even really try. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=34.28s)]
*  Making voters happy is not a feature of the equity agenda. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=36.8s)]
*  Punishment is the point of the equity agenda, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=40.08s)]
*  inflicting pain on the right people, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=42.4s)]
*  dispensing rough justice, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=44.4s)]
*  meeting out reparations by other names. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=45.64s)]
*  In his speeches, you can see clearly [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=48.32s)]
*  how Joe Biden feels about America. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=50.06s)]
*  He's deeply disappointed in the country [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  and he's annoyed with the people who lives here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=54.5s)]
*  Biden doesn't cajole voters. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=56.980000000000004s)]
*  He harangues and berates them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=58.68s)]
*  He patronizes them and issues threats. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=60.52s)]
*  You caused the corona pandemic. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=63.04s)]
*  You're stupid and selfish. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=65.28s)]
*  No Fourth of July hot dogs until you obey. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=66.6s)]
*  So for an American president, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=70.52s)]
*  this is an entirely new way of governing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=71.84s)]
*  And you've got to wonder how long it can continue. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=74.16s)]
*  How exactly are Democrats going to hold on to power [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  in the coming midterm elections? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=79.32s)]
*  If you think about it, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=81.68s)]
*  there's only one way they can do that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=82.52s)]
*  They've got to create a new form of government, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=84.34s)]
*  one that keeps incumbents in power forever, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=86.8s)]
*  no matter what they do, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  no matter how incompetent and destructive they may be. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  One way to do that is by diluting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=93.84s)]
*  the political power of citizens. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  And that's why Democrats in New York [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=97.2s)]
*  are allowing nearly a million foreign nationals here illegally [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=98.7s)]
*  to vote in local elections. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=102.14s)]
*  It's why Gavin Newsom has announced [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=103.9s)]
*  that California is now going to offer [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=105.2s)]
*  unlimited healthcare to illegal aliens [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=106.8s)]
*  so that more of them will come. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=108.9s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=110.7s)]
*  And that's why Democrats are pushing for what they describe [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=111.84s)]
*  as a transformative voting rights bill. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=114.08s)]
*  It's their top legislative priorities, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=116.8s)]
*  the main thing they care about. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=118.78s)]
*  Joe Biden had a speech about it this afternoon in Georgia. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=120.6s)]
*  The event didn't start well, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=123.56s)]
*  as he has before Biden referred to his running mate [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=125.16s)]
*  as the President of the United States, if only. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=127.4s)]
*  Then, as he almost always does [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=130.18s)]
*  during public appearances these days, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=132.22s)]
*  Joe Biden got angry. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=134.26s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=135.48s)]
*  It's also time to pass [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=136.52s)]
*  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=137.78s)]
*  I've been having these quiet conversations [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=140.72s)]
*  with the members of Congress for the last two months. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=142.96s)]
*  I'm tired of being quiet. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=145.24s)]
*  So what is this John Lewis Civil Rights Act [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=148.34s)]
*  that grouchy old Joe Biden is tired of being quiet about? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, at its heart, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=155.44s)]
*  the bill would give the federal government [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  the power to control how elections are conducted [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=158.4s)]
*  across the country. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=160.58s)]
*  The bill requires states to obtain pre-clearance [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  from the federal government [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=165.24s)]
*  before they can set the rules of their own elections. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  What does this mean? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=168.62s)]
*  Well, it means, among other things, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=169.8s)]
*  that states would no longer have the authority [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=171.14s)]
*  to require voter identification or registration at the polls. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=173.82s)]
*  States would also lose the power [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=178.1s)]
*  to pick the locations for polling sites, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=179.38s)]
*  as well as the ability to draw the boundaries [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=181.61999999999998s)]
*  of their own congressional districts. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=183.61999999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's what it's about. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=185.7s)]
*  Before doing virtually anything related to democracy, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=187.54s)]
*  states would have to follow a formula [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=190.42s)]
*  written by Democrats that, needless to say, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  focuses mainly on race. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, the idea is simple. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=196.22s)]
*  The idea is this country is too racist [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=197.06s)]
*  to allow states to run their own affairs. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=199.7s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi has to run them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  Only she is non-racist enough to conduct elections. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=202.7s)]
*  Everything about that claim is absurd. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  If America is so racist, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=208.33999999999997s)]
*  then why have tens of thousands of Haitians [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=209.66s)]
*  not got across our border this year? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=211.66s)]
*  It'd be nice to hear someone answer that question [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  or even ask it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=215.61999999999998s)]
*  But the idea itself is totally unconstitutional. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  We know this because the Supreme Court [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=221.33999999999997s)]
*  was pretty clear about it almost 10 years ago, back in 2013. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=222.5s)]
*  This is not allowed. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=226.38s)]
*  It's never been allowed. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=228.06s)]
*  And in fact, no sane population would ever allow it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=229.74s)]
*  Not voluntarily, anyway. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=233.3s)]
*  Why would you let incumbent politicians [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=235.02s)]
*  rig the game in their own favor? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=237.62s)]
*  Well, you would not allow that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=239.5s)]
*  You'd have to be bullied into it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=241.22s)]
*  How would you be bullied? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=242.84s)]
*  You know the answer. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=244.02s)]
*  The fastest way to bully Americans, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=245.22s)]
*  other than by scaring them with viruses, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=247.26s)]
*  is to call them racist. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=249.7s)]
*  So of course, that's precise to what [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=251.1s)]
*  the Democratic party is doing right now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=252.22s)]
*  They're telling us the Civil Rights Movement never happened. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  It's still 1951 in Birmingham, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=256.18s)]
*  and you, my friend, are Bull Connor. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=257.86s)]
*  Shut up and obey, racist. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=259.86s)]
*  Joe Biden's never been very subtle, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=262.6s)]
*  so today he just came out and said it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=263.94s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=266.26s)]
*  Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  or Jefferson Davis? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=274.94s)]
*  This is the moment to decide, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=277.22s)]
*  to defend our elections, to defend our democracy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=279.98s)]
*  Bull Connor? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=284.32s)]
*  Everyone under 70 is thinking, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=285.26s)]
*  football player, who's that? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=287.14s)]
*  But Jefferson Davis, really? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  So if you oppose an unconstitutional power grab [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  by corrupt politicians in their 80s, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=294.9s)]
*  you are the leader of a Confederacy. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=296.82s)]
*  You're a foreign combatant. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=301.76s)]
*  That's how important it is to keep [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=303.34s)]
*  the Democratic party in power forever, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=305.46s)]
*  and that's why we need to change the way the Senate votes, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=307.46s)]
*  so we'll never lose an election again. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=309.5s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden today. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=311.26s)]
*  We must find a way to pass these voting rights bill. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=313.14s)]
*  Debate them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=316.62s)]
*  Vote. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  Let the majority prevail. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=318.68s)]
*  And if that bare minimum is blocked, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  we have no option but to change the Senate rules, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=324.9s)]
*  including getting rid of the filibuster for this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=332.0s)]
*  Getting rid of the filibuster. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=333.22s)]
*  We can go on about this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=335.16s)]
*  You've heard it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=336.22s)]
*  You probably know, but it's worth remembering [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=337.06s)]
*  that the Democratic party, Joe Biden's party, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=338.42s)]
*  invoked the filibuster more than 300 times recently. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=340.6s)]
*  Oh, not during the Civil Rights Movement. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=343.98s)]
*  That was in 2020. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=346.06s)]
*  Apparently they sided with Bull Connor every time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=347.98s)]
*  So what's different? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=350.98s)]
*  Well, the threat of white terror, of course. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=351.94s)]
*  Getting rid of voter ID laws is a matter [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=354.02s)]
*  of national security, Biden explained. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=356.3s)]
*  Stand in the way, and you may be a terrorist. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=359.22s)]
*  Once again, the president. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=361.6s)]
*  I will not yield. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=363.82s)]
*  I will not flinch. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=365.02s)]
*  I will defend the right to vote. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=366.02s)]
*  Our democracy against all enemies, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=367.92s)]
*  foreign and yes, domestic. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=369.94s)]
*  Enemies within our own country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=373.94s)]
*  We will kill them. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=376.34s)]
*  It's kind of amusing to see Joe Biden [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=378.5s)]
*  call other people extremists. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=380.18s)]
*  The message, give me total power over your life [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=382.12s)]
*  or else I'll know you're a dangerous radical. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  It's pretty funny, but it's also not funny. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=386.58s)]
*  Just hours before Joe Biden spoke, the DOJ, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=388.62s)]
*  the Department of Justice, announced the formation [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=391.09999999999997s)]
*  of a new domestic terrorism unit. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=392.85999999999996s)]
*  What's it for? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=395.02s)]
*  Well, you can read about it on the website. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=396.26s)]
*  It's designed to hunt down and punish anyone [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=397.97999999999996s)]
*  who opposes the federal government [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=400.26s)]
*  or is otherwise, quote, anti-authority. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=401.74s)]
*  Anti-authority, who's that? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=404.62s)]
*  Well, pretty much at this point, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  all thinking people who aren't directly [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  on the federal payroll. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=409.18s)]
*  That means you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=410.5s)]
*  It means all of us. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=411.86s)]
*  Got the message? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=412.7s)]
*  If you think voters ought to show ID at the polls, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  you could be hearing from the FBI because you're a threat. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=416.66s)]
*  On the other hand, speaking of papers, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=419.90000000000003s)]
*  you should know that your COVID papers [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=421.42s)]
*  are still mandatory and becoming more so [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  because VAX cards are not at all like driver's licenses [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=425.26s)]
*  at polling places. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=427.66s)]
*  They're not racist. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=428.5s)]
*  VAX cards are holy and they're essential. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=429.86s)]
*  In fact, in Washington, DC, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=432.54s)]
*  the mayor Muriel Bowser has announced [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  you're no longer allowed outside without your papers. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=435.62s)]
*  Here's the quote, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=438.26s)]
*  starting Saturday, you will need these three things [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=439.38s)]
*  before heading out. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=442.18s)]
*  Proof of vaccination, 12 years and over, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=444.06s)]
*  proof of vaccination and photo ID and a mask. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=447.02000000000004s)]
*  Otherwise, you must stay in your house [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=451.26s)]
*  because we own your body. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=452.42s)]
*  That's Muriel Bowser, who by the way, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=454.64s)]
*  is not a dangerous extremist. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  Or she can't be because she's loyal to the regime. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSgquEQ6Dk&t=457.3s)]
