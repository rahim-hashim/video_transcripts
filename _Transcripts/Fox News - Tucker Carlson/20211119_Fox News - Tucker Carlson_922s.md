# Tucker: This drives Democrats insane about Rittenhouse verdict
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, a significant day in the recent history [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=2.4s)]
*  of the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=5.5s)]
*  We're gonna have an hour of details for you, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=6.36s)]
*  but before we jump into them, a little bit of context. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=8.5s)]
*  Here's how the story started. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=11.4s)]
*  Just so we all remember. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=13.8s)]
*  17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse wound up on the street [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=15.98s)]
*  in Kenosha in the first place with a gun for one reason. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=19.14s)]
*  He was there because in the summer of 2020, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=23.12s)]
*  the leadership of the Democratic Party endorsed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=25.44s)]
*  mob violence for political ends. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=27.72s)]
*  That's why there were riots in Kenosha that night [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  because people like Kamala Harris supported those riots. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=32.78s)]
*  More than a year later, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=35.98s)]
*  as Rittenhouse stood trial for murder, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=36.92s)]
*  those very same people implied there would be more violence [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=38.4s)]
*  if he was acquitted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=42.4s)]
*  So imagine being a juror on that case. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=44.22s)]
*  Imagine the pressure and the fear. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=47.2s)]
*  It would take enormous moral courage for any juror [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  to ignore the threats and follow the evidence [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=53.4s)]
*  to its logical conclusion. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=55.42s)]
*  So much courage that at times we doubted [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=57.3s)]
*  it was even possible in a country as politicized [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=59.26s)]
*  as ours now is. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=61.5s)]
*  But as we learn today, it is still possible, thank God. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=63.16s)]
*  This afternoon, the jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=67.46s)]
*  on all charges. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=69.62s)]
*  The jury affirmed what was obvious from the very beginning. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=70.66s)]
*  He acted in self-defense. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=72.98s)]
*  It was a wonderful moment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=75.9s)]
*  Anyone who believes in impartial justice was vindicated. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=77.62s)]
*  Here's what that moment looked like. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=81.24s)]
*  As the first comment of the information, Joseph Roosevelt, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=83.58s)]
*  we, the jury find a defendant, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=87.54s)]
*  Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  As to the second comment of the information, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=92.56s)]
*  Richard McGuinness, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=95.38000000000001s)]
*  we the jury by the defendant [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=96.66000000000001s)]
*  Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=98.5s)]
*  As to the third comment of the information, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=101.06s)]
*  unknown mail, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  we the jury by the defendant, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=104.58000000000001s)]
*  Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=106.62s)]
*  As to the fourth comment of the information, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=109.26s)]
*  Anthony Keuer, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=111.7s)]
*  we the jury by the defendant, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=112.98s)]
*  Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=114.64000000000001s)]
*  To the fifth count of the information, Gage Rose-Croitz, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=117.18s)]
*  we the jury find the defendant, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  Remarkable. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=127.18s)]
*  Months of relentless lying from the media about this case [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=128.66s)]
*  in the end had no effect whatsoever on the jury. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=131.94s)]
*  Propaganda doesn't always win. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=135.66s)]
*  Today it was soundly defeated. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=138.14000000000001s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=139.5s)]
*  Our documentary team was there in Kenosha when it happened. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=140.86s)]
*  They'd been there for days putting together [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  an installment of our Tucker Carlson Original Series [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=144.9s)]
*  on this case. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=147.02s)]
*  And they captured Kyle Rittenhouse's first moments [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=148.34s)]
*  outside the court today after being acquitted. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  It's the stuff that keeps you up at night. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=155.46s)]
*  Once you finally do get to sleep, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  your dreams are about what happened, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=160.9s)]
*  and you're waking up in a dark, cold sweat. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  You had dreams about what happened? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=168.18s)]
*  Every single night. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=170.38s)]
*  It's quite scary, actually, because the dreams [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=174.22s)]
*  feel so real, and they're not the same at all. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=176.94s)]
*  They're all different. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  They're the different scenarios that run through your head [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  during the day, like what could have happened? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=184.22s)]
*  I'm alive, but what could have happened? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=187.46s)]
*  What if I wasn't alive, or what if I did let Mr. Rosenbaum [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=190.78s)]
*  steal my gun? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=195.5s)]
*  It's those type of dreams. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=196.26s)]
*  The outcome of it's bad, but almost every outcome [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=198.02s)]
*  is either me getting seriously injured or hurt or dead. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=202.02s)]
*  Those are just the dreams I have on a daily basis. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  The defendant will rise, face the jury, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=211.06s)]
*  and harken to its verdicts. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  State of Wisconsin versus Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=216.58s)]
*  As to the first count of the information, Joseph Rosenbaum. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=219.34s)]
*  We, the jury, find the defendant, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=222.9s)]
*  not guilty. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=226.02s)]
*  As to the second count of the information, Bridget McGinnis, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=227.78s)]
*  we, the jury, find the defendant, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=231.38s)]
*  not guilty. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=234.38s)]
*  How do you feel, man? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  The jury reached the correct verdict. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  Self-defense is not illegal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=240.26s)]
*  And I believe they came to the correct verdict, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=243.74s)]
*  and I'm glad that everything went well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=246.06s)]
*  It's been a rough journey, but we made it through it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=248.94s)]
*  We made it through the hard part. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=252.38s)]
*  Watch that clip. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=258.9s)]
*  You're reminded that maybe the one person in America [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=259.62s)]
*  who hasn't yet weighed in on the Kyle Rittenhouse trial [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=261.9s)]
*  is Kyle Rittenhouse himself. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=265.14s)]
*  So for months, CNN and MSNBC and Kamala Harris [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  have been allowed to define him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=269.74s)]
*  That ends Monday. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=271.1s)]
*  We're sitting down for a long interview with Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=272.42s)]
*  You can see it on this show Monday night. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=274.54s)]
*  We hope you will. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=275.86s)]
*  So technically, as a legal matter, this case is over. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=277.66s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse has been proclaimed innocent [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=280.7s)]
*  in a court of law. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=282.42s)]
*  He's free to resume his life. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=283.1s)]
*  But for the authoritarians among us, this is a disaster. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=285.22s)]
*  They can't let it go. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=288.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=289.38s)]
*  Because they understand the Rittenhouse case [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=290.58s)]
*  is a referendum on the most basic right of all, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=293.58s)]
*  the ancient right of self-defense. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=297.18s)]
*  If Kyle Rittenhouse can save his own life from the mob, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=300.14s)]
*  then you can too. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  And that drives them insane. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=305.42s)]
*  So insane that the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=307.42s)]
*  today, Jerry Nadler of New York, implied that Kyle Rittenhouse [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=310.14s)]
*  may face federal charges. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=313.3s)]
*  Today's verdict, Nadler wrote, justifies federal review [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=315.34s)]
*  by the DOJ. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=318.14s)]
*  So will Joe Biden's Justice Department indict Kyle [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  Rittenhouse now that he's been acquitted [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=322.38s)]
*  by a jury in Wisconsin? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=324.02s)]
*  It's hard to believe. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=325.34s)]
*  You'd have to be deranged even to consider something [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=326.38s)]

*  What would be the effect on the country? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=329.02s)]
*  But you never know with these people. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=331.46s)]
*  At the very least, this case will [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=333.26s)]
*  be used to justify taking your guns away. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=334.9s)]
*  Bet on it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=336.74s)]
*  But if this does go to the feds, if Kyle Rittenhouse is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=338.02s)]
*  prosecuted by the DOJ, the case will likely [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=341.38s)]
*  be handled by Kristen Clark. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=343.14s)]
*  She's the black nationalist who runs the so-called Civil Rights [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=344.3s)]
*  Division of the Justice Department, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=347.3s)]
*  the division that does not protect your civil rights, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  in fact, is trying to take them away. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=350.62s)]
*  Last year, Clark weighed in on the Rittenhouse case [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=352.5s)]
*  and immediately, not surprisingly, zeroed in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=354.98s)]
*  on Rittenhouse's color. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=357.58s)]
*  Like his race was some kind of crime. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=359.62s)]
*  She described him as a quote, armed white man, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=362.1s)]
*  murdering innocent protesters at quote, point blank range. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=365.22s)]
*  What does his race have to do with anything? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=369.02s)]
*  Well, it doesn't have anything to do with anything, of course. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=372.06s)]
*  But it's been a fixation of the Democratic Party [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=374.42s)]
*  from the first moments. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=377.18s)]
*  They've tried to racialize this case. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=378.22s)]
*  And by the way, Kristen Clark is far from the only member [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=380.1s)]
*  of the party to try and do that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=382.18s)]
*  Just hours after the jury's verdict, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=385.42s)]

*  released this statement. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=389.34000000000003s)]
*  Quote, it is disgusting and disturbing [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=390.18s)]
*  that someone was able to carry a loaded assault rifle [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=392.42s)]
*  into a protest against the unjust killing of Jacob Blake, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=394.7s)]
*  an unarmed black man. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  End quote. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=400.66s)]
*  Savor that for a minute. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=402.06s)]
*  That's from the head of the Democratic Party's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=403.06s)]
*  congressional campaign arm. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=405.18s)]
*  Everything about it is wrong. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=407.66s)]
*  Not just a lie, but factually untrue. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=409.1s)]
*  Jacob Blake was not killed. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=410.5s)]
*  He was also not unarmed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=412.3s)]
*  He was carrying a knife. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=414.38s)]
*  We know that because he said he was carrying a knife. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=415.22s)]
*  He was allegedly trying to kidnap a child. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=417.82s)]
*  That's why the police showed up. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=419.38s)]
*  And when he grabbed a knife, they shot him. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=420.38s)]
*  Again, that's not in dispute. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=422.14s)]
*  And he's still alive. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=423.94s)]
*  But it doesn't matter because these people's facts [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=426.62s)]
*  don't matter, clearly. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=428.82s)]
*  Sean Patrick Maloney has no interest [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=431.22s)]
*  in what actually happened. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris said that she was proud of Jacob Blake last year. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=434.9s)]
*  The Democratic Party is sticking with that, too. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=437.5s)]
*  They are trying, and they have from the very beginning, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=439.73999999999995s)]
*  to make this case into a racial divide, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=442.82s)]
*  to further divide the country. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris today said that the outcome of this case, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=447.53999999999996s)]
*  the jury's verdict, was proof that our judicial system is not, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=451.26s)]
*  quote, equitable, whatever that means. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=455.5s)]
*  It needs to be changed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=458.7s)]
*  The attorney general of the state of New York [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=459.85999999999996s)]
*  said it needs to be completely torn down and rebuilt [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=461.58s)]
*  our justice system that we've had for 250 years. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=464.5s)]
*  It's the best thing in our country, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=466.73999999999995s)]
*  the idea that you are tried on the basis of the facts, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=468.5s)]
*  not on the basis of what you look like. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=471.46s)]
*  But they'd like to change that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=472.94s)]
*  ABC News, by the way, just reported the same thing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=474.94s)]
*  They told us, ABC News, a news corporation, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=477.74s)]
*  has told us that, in fact, Jacob Blake was killed in Kenosha. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=480.74s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=484.14s)]
*  Well, it's very significant. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=485.53999999999996s)]
*  First, for the community of Kenosha, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  this city was traumatized by the police killing [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  of a black man, Jacob Blake. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=493.18s)]
*  The police killing of a black man who is, in fact, still alive. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=495.94s)]
*  So what are they doing when they tell lies like this, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=500.74s)]
*  lies that you can check very easily [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=503.54s)]
*  or if you have a memory that extends into last year, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=505.3s)]
*  you recall very well? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=507.18s)]
*  Well, they're inciting people, of course. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=509.46000000000004s)]
*  They're trying to whip people into a frenzy [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=511.34000000000003s)]
*  on the basis of claims that are totally provably untrue. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=513.34s)]
*  What kind of a frenzy? Well, consider this. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=518.22s)]
*  This is from a senior advisor at the DCCC, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=520.82s)]
*  the Democratic campaign arm. His name is Daiwan Tatro. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=523.6600000000001s)]
*  He just issued an explicit call for riots. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=527.0200000000001s)]
*  No justice, no peace, he wrote in the wake of the verdict. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=528.86s)]
*  Who is Daiwan Tatro? Well, he, according to news reports, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  spent a decade in prison after he shot two people. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=535.38s)]
*  Now he works for the Democratic Party. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=538.0600000000001s)]
*  Just in case you're interested in whose side they're on. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=539.82s)]
*  But you knew that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=542.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Congressman Val Demings, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=544.1800000000001s)]
*  another Democrat, offered this assessment. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=547.2600000000001s)]
*  The core of the far-right movement [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=549.1s)]
*  is that they should be able to kill you if they want to. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=551.34s)]
*  That's the official line of the Democratic Party tonight. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=554.7s)]
*  Keep in mind, and if you watch the trial, you know this, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=558.58s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse was walking down the street [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=561.9s)]
*  when he was charged by a convicted child rapist [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=563.7s)]
*  and then charged by a number of other people. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=567.46s)]
*  He sought no conflict. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=570.46s)]
*  There was never any evidence [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=571.58s)]
*  that he was the aggressor in any case. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=572.82s)]
*  He was aggressed against. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=576.5400000000001s)]
*  So Joe Biden also weighed in on this, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=579.26s)]
*  and he gave two versions of his views on it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=581.0600000000001s)]
*  First, he said, we're going to respect the jury's verdict. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=585.58s)]
*  And then, of course, when his advisors took over [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=588.02s)]
*  and wrote a new press statement, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=589.82s)]
*  he told us how upset he was by the verdict, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=592.58s)]
*  and that's what aired on MSNBC all day. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=594.9s)]
*  The next time there's a protest of some sort, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=598.02s)]
*  and it may get politicized, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=601.86s)]
*  that gun owners with a certain ideology [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=603.5s)]
*  may feel incentivized now, may feel even emboldened. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=607.82s)]
*  What some may take from this verdict [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=611.62s)]
*  is that vigilante justice prevailed. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=613.82s)]
*  Knowing the history of vigilante justice in this country [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=616.94s)]
*  all the way back to times of enslavement [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=620.1800000000001s)]
*  when people would be deputized to go out [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=623.2600000000001s)]
*  and track down enslaved persons who ran away, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=626.74s)]
*  to lynching mobs, and this is 2021. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=630.6600000000001s)]
*  It is to tell the current and future [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=634.46s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouses of the world [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=636.34s)]
*  that they can engage in white vigilanteism [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=638.38s)]
*  and be let off for it, be defended and protected [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=640.74s)]
*  for perpetuating white supremacy. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  White vigilanteism, white supremacy, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=647.98s)]
*  white, white, white, white, white. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=650.94s)]
*  That was all over media all day long. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=651.86s)]
*  Explicit racial attacks. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=654.02s)]
*  What does that have to do with this case, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=656.5400000000001s)]
*  and in what kind of country is that allowed [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=658.34s)]
*  when the most powerful people in the country [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=660.4200000000001s)]
*  level explicit racial attacks [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=662.86s)]
*  against one of their countrymen? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=665.3s)]
*  Most of us didn't grow up in a country [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=667.8199999999999s)]
*  where people talk like this. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=669.0999999999999s)]
*  It's very ominous that they're talking like this now. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=670.42s)]
*  Just as a reminder, in case you're tuning in [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=672.8599999999999s)]
*  for the first time in a year, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=675.06s)]
*  everyone involved in this case is the same color. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=676.14s)]
*  The people of the Council on American-Islamic Relations [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=680.62s)]
*  offered this take, which was very common today on the left, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=683.38s)]
*  quote, it is difficult to imagine a black [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=687.74s)]
*  or Muslim defendant engaged in the same conduct [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=690.0999999999999s)]
*  being found not guilty. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=692.62s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=694.78s)]
*  Were you here for the OJ trial? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=695.9s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=697.62s)]
*  MSNBC, the network that was banned from the courthouse [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=698.9399999999999s)]
*  for following jurors around, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=701.8199999999999s)]
*  broadcast this racial screed today [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=703.02s)]
*  from a relative of Jacob Blake's. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=704.66s)]
*  Now you tell us why he got a free ride. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=707.1s)]
*  His bail money was raised by the proud boys, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=709.1s)]
*  the Ku Klux Klan, the Nazis, the skinheads. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=711.8199999999999s)]
*  Are they plugged up in this courtroom? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=716.02s)]
*  Do we know the history of this judge? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=718.38s)]
*  I heard he's been racist as hell [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=720.3399999999999s)]
*  to these people in Kenosha for many years. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=721.62s)]
*  It's really, really dark. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=725.78s)]
*  The rest of us should not allow them [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=727.5s)]
*  to get away with racializing this, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=729.26s)]
*  allow them to get away with attacking people [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=731.5s)]
*  on the basis of their skin color. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=733.14s)]
*  That is always wrong. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=734.4599999999999s)]
*  We would never engage in that, never have, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=735.74s)]
*  and no one should do that [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=737.38s)]
*  because it divides the country and it's immoral, flat out. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=739.3399999999999s)]
*  But somehow, through the crazy logic [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=742.5799999999999s)]
*  that governs their positions and their deeds, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=744.9399999999999s)]
*  they wind up defending child rapists and domestic abusers, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=746.9s)]
*  elevating them to some sort of hero status. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=752.86s)]
*  The former mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=756.26s)]
*  wrote this today, quote, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=757.86s)]
*  Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=759.54s)]
*  They should be alive today. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=761.9s)]
*  Maybe we'll get a statue, a very small statue, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=763.3s)]
*  to Joseph Rosenbaum in New York someday. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=766.4599999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, the ACLU, which you'd think [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=768.62s)]
*  would be in favor of self-defense, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=770.4599999999999s)]
*  that's the most basic of all civil liberties, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=772.22s)]
*  suggested that crossing state lines is somehow a crime. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=774.22s)]
*  Stay in your own state. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=776.5s)]
*  Here's what they said, quote, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=777.78s)]
*  despite Kyle Rittenhouse's conscious decision [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=778.6999999999999s)]
*  to travel across state lines and injure one person, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=780.82s)]
*  take the lives of two people, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=783.0200000000001s)]
*  protesting the shooting of Jacob Blake by police, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=784.0600000000001s)]
*  he was not held responsible for his actions. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=786.38s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=789.46s)]
*  And by the way, the continuous references [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=790.3000000000001s)]
*  to crossing state lines are not insignificant. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=792.7800000000001s)]
*  Legally, they're meaningless. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=795.1800000000001s)]
*  You have a right to cross state lines [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=796.22s)]
*  if you're an American because it's your country. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=797.74s)]
*  You can, in fact, go to all 50 states [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=799.34s)]
*  and you're not breaking a crime. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=800.62s)]
*  So why are they bringing that phrase [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=802.0600000000001s)]
*  into every analysis of the case, crossing state lines? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=803.6600000000001s)]
*  Because they want to use this to change gun laws. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=807.0600000000001s)]
*  That's why. You watch. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=809.1400000000001s)]
*  So if you want to know what the worst people [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=811.3000000000001s)]
*  in the world are saying, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=813.38s)]
*  obviously you're going to tune into [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=814.46s)]
*  Jeb Bush's former flack on MSNBC. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=815.7800000000001s)]
*  She told us today that anyone who crosses state lines [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=818.86s)]
*  is a domestic terrorist. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=821.7s)]
*  The Kyle Rittenhouse acquittal today, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=823.62s)]
*  not guilty on all counts, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=825.6600000000001s)]
*  did not happen in a cultural vacuum. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=827.1800000000001s)]
*  There's some alarming context to this moment [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=829.58s)]
*  worth considering and talking about. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=831.82s)]
*  Just last week, the Department of Homeland Security [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=833.7800000000001s)]
*  released its latest bulletin warning Americans again [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=835.94s)]
*  of the ongoing threat posed by domestic violent extremists. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=839.42s)]
*  We should also point out conservative media [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=843.06s)]
*  for many, many months have been priming its audience [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=845.2199999999999s)]
*  for this moment, framing Rittenhouse as a hero. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=848.74s)]
*  So why are we inflicting tape like that on you [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=854.3s)]
*  on a day when all of us should be celebrating? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=857.18s)]
*  We'll tell you why. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=860.14s)]
*  Because none of that made any difference to the jury. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=861.62s)]
*  And if you're totally absorbed in American media, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=865.5s)]
*  you get the impression that American media [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=868.1s)]
*  are in charge of our country. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=870.34s)]
*  And it turns out they're not. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=872.5400000000001s)]
*  Most people don't watch that crap. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=874.22s)]
*  They don't care what people like that say. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=875.3000000000001s)]
*  They don't care at all. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=876.86s)]
*  There are a lot of rational, decent, thoughtful people [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=878.4200000000001s)]
*  on all sides of all races in this country [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=881.62s)]
*  who are still willing to think clearly about what is right, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=884.5s)]
*  what is wrong, what is factual, what is false, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=887.82s)]
*  what is just, and what is not. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=889.82s)]
*  And today they did. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=892.9s)]
*  So that's the real lesson here. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=894.74s)]
*  In the face of all of that propaganda, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=896.54s)]
*  a group of jurors in Kenosha, Wisconsin [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=899.3399999999999s)]
*  were brave enough to reach the right [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=902.9s)]
*  and obvious conclusion anyway. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=904.98s)]
*  Amen. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=906.86s)]
*  Yay for America. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIAK59GYA&t=908.5s)]
