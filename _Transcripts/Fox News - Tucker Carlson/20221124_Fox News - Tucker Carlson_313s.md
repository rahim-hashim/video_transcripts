# Bob Woodson: Our nation is facing a crisis of values, not race
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c)
*  A man called John Arntz has been the director of elections in the city of San Francisco [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=0.0s)]
*  for two decades. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=5.34s)]
*  Before Arntz took over, elections in the city were a bad joke. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=7.44s)]
*  People routinely find ballot boxes floating in San Francisco Bay. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=10.58s)]
*  So Arntz cleaned up the whole election process, and no one really denies that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=13.92s)]
*  But this week, San Francisco's elections commission fired John Arntz. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=17.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=22.04s)]
*  Well, they did it because he had the wrong skin color. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=23.04s)]
*  And they admit it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=26.0s)]
*  As elections commission president Chris Jodonek told Arntz, quote, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=27.64s)]
*  Our decision wasn't about your performance, but after 20 years we wanted to take action [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=31.64s)]
*  on the city's racial equity plan. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=35.78s)]
*  So that's illegal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=38.5s)]
*  You're not allowed to fire people in the United States under federal and state law in every [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=40.72s)]
*  state because of their skin color. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  And we have an entire civil rights division at the Justice Department that exists to prevent [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  things like this from happening. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=52.32s)]
*  And we had an entire civil rights movement designed to make sure that people were never [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=53.88s)]
*  fired because of their skin color. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  And yet no one's saying a word. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=59.68s)]
*  Barack Obama, Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL, our self-appointed moral superman, the NAACP. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=60.88s)]
*  Not a word. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=67.36s)]
*  No one's paid them to complain yet. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=68.60000000000001s)]
*  Bob Woodson experienced firsthand the civil rights movement. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=70.72s)]
*  He's founder and president of the Woodson Center. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=74.4s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Woodson, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  So if you wind up in a place where it's... [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for inviting me, Tucker. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=82.48s)]
*  Well, of course, because you've just seen both ends of this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=83.64s)]
*  If you wind up back in a country where it's OK to say, I'm firing you because of the way [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=86.84s)]
*  you look, it kind of seems like maybe the last 60 years were for nothing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=91.04s)]
*  It really does, Tucker. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  It's insulting and it's degrading. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  In fact, what progressives are doing, they have hijacked the rich legacy of the civil [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  rights movement and using it as a bludgeon against the values of this nation, when in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=109.55999999999999s)]
*  fact it was those same values that enabled black America to survive slavery and discrimination. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  In one sense, we are worse off now than the last 50 years than we have the first 100 years [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=122.08s)]
*  after doing Jim Crow because the crisis facing America is one of values. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=128.28s)]
*  It is not race. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=136.2s)]
*  Well, and of course, the civil rights movement was driven by and led by faithful Christians, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=137.88s)]
*  Christian ministers, and that whole component, and of course, slavery was abolished by Christian [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=145.08s)]
*  ministers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=151.52s)]
*  I never hear that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=152.52s)]
*  It's been like completely flipped on its head. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=153.6s)]
*  No, you really don't. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=158.08s)]
*  And, you know, I make the case when they just denigrate the nuclear family and also Christian [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=159.08s)]
*  faith. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=165.16s)]
*  You know, there's a test that I try to apply to people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=166.16s)]
*  If you are run out of gas at 10 o'clock at night in a high crime neighborhood and the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=170.44s)]
*  gas station is two blocks away and you have the option of confronting two groups of people, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=175.88s)]
*  ten men who came around the corner and they had just left the bar, and ten other men who [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=183.44s)]
*  came around just left Bible study, which group would you want to confront? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=190.48s)]
*  Even atheists don't name their children Judas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=195.4s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=199.08s)]
*  People instinctively know that these values are important. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=201.6s)]
*  And when we're talking about violence and the disorganization that exists in our centers, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=209.84s)]
*  it doesn't exist all over. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=216.0s)]
*  If you were to go to religious enclaves in this country, you will see that there is order, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=217.56s)]
*  there is respect for family. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=228.0s)]
*  You don't see drug addiction out of wedlock births. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=229.68s)]
*  If you go to any Orthodox Jewish, Muslim or Christian community like United, and you [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  will see these values that enabled black America to survive slavery and discrimination still [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=240.08s)]
*  in place. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=246.44s)]
*  But we don't focus on the value component of these communities and the fact that there [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=247.8s)]
*  are healing agents there that have the capacity to transform and redeem these communities. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=254.32s)]
*  But what we're up against is the race grievance industry and they have had jock, they demonize [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=261.36s)]
*  the family, they demonize our Christian values. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=267.48s)]
*  And that's why the Woodson Center is doing, we are pushing back because we must deracialize [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=270.64s)]
*  race and these civil rights leaders are complicit in their silence. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=276.52s)]
*  I saw a white woman with a Black Lives Matter t-shirt on beating a black woman pushing a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  baby because she was in a Trump rally. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=287.6s)]
*  And yet the civil rights leaders were silent about that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=290.6s)]
*  I'm sorry to laugh. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=293.44s)]
*  It's so grotesque. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=295.6s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=297.18s)]
*  Bob Woodson, who has seen it all. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiw55ptOI1c&t=298.44s)]
