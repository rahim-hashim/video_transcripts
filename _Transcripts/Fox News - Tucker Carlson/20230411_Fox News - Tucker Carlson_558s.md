# Trump vows criminal conviction won't stop him from 2024 presidential run
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4)
*  Do you think Biden will stay in the race? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=0.0s)]
*  Look, I watch him just like you do. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=4.24s)]
*  And I think it's almost inappropriate for me to say it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=9.0s)]
*  But I deal with other people. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=14.08s)]
*  I don't see how it's possible. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=15.84s)]
*  And it's not an age thing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=18.0s)]
*  You know, like I say, I have friends that are 88, 89, 92. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=19.68s)]
*  Bernie Marcus, Home Depot is 95. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=23.52s)]
*  Smart as hell. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  He's sharp as he was. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he's, you know, mentally, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=29.24s)]
*  Bernie Marcus, Home Depot, founder of Home Depot, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=33.28s)]
*  one of the founders. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I had a meeting with him a few months ago. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=37.2s)]
*  He was 100%. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=39.64s)]
*  I know people that built their fortunes from 80 to 90. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=41.6s)]
*  They were always struggling, and they made a fortune [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=45.8s)]
*  from 80 to 90, a couple of people in particular. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=48.2s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  He's not too old. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, his age. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  I think they do the age thing because I'm four or five years [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=54.56s)]
*  behind. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=56.8s)]
*  They say, this is a way of getting Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=57.84s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=59.24s)]
*  But there's something wrong. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=61.2s)]
*  I saw his answer today on television about whether or not [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=63.24s)]
*  he was going to run to a very nice guy named Al Roker. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=67.0s)]
*  When you can't get a softer question than that, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=70.56s)]
*  that was a long answer. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=73.16s)]
*  Talking about the eggs and this and that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=75.44s)]
*  Look, I don't think he can, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=77.36s)]
*  but say what you want. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  They didn't expect him to get it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=84.64s)]
*  People could say he won an election. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=86.96s)]
*  You know, it always goes, I got the most votes of any person, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  any sitting president in history. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=93.44s)]
*  I was told if I got 15 million less, I couldn't lose. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  They're surrounded by vicious, smart people, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=99.96s)]
*  radical left people, but they're very smart [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=103.35999999999999s)]
*  and they're very vicious. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=106.32s)]
*  It's not him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=108.72s)]
*  It's not him. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=110.36s)]
*  He's now in Ireland. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=112.08s)]
*  He's not going to have a news conference. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=112.91999999999999s)]
*  When the world is exploding, I own property in Ireland. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=114.68s)]
*  I'm not going to Ireland. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=119.04s)]
*  The world is exploding around us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=120.04s)]
*  You could end up in a third world war [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=123.2s)]
*  and this guy's gonna be in Ireland [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=125.12s)]
*  and not having a news, he hasn't had a news conference, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=127.4s)]
*  I guess, in months. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=129.72s)]
*  I saw it today where he has, it's been. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=130.56s)]
*  Well, he can't. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=132.16s)]
*  So if he doesn't run, if he's taken out by his own party [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=133.52s)]
*  or who knows what happens, but doesn't seem like [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=136.72s)]
*  he's capable of running again, who does run? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=138.76s)]
*  Well, obviously the one that they would talk about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=141.56s)]
*  would be the vice president, Kamala. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=146.0s)]
*  That would be the one that they talk about. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=150.12s)]
*  But I don't think she's performed well on the big stage. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, maybe I'm wrong. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=156.2s)]
*  But there are a certain group of people [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=157.96s)]
*  that will go crazy if it's not her. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=159.24s)]
*  They're gonna go very angry. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=161.52s)]
*  They're gonna be very angry if it's not her. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=162.4s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=165.4s)]
*  You have a very ambitious guy in California, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=168.16s)]
*  but he's done a terrible job with the state. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  I used to get along great with him when I was president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=171.92s)]
*  I got along really good, Gavin. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, you got along with Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=177.92s)]
*  I did, I really did. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=179.28s)]
*  He was always very nice to me. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=180.11999999999998s)]
*  He said the greatest things. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  He would say things like he's doing a great job. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  Oh, he was very nice. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  About you? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  About me, that's why I could never hit him [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=186.92s)]
*  because he was so nice to me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=188.16s)]
*  He's just laying in wait. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=190.6s)]
*  But I could, he was very nice to me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=192.76s)]
*  And relatively speaking, some of them weren't. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  We did a good job for the governors, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=200.4s)]
*  but they talk about him. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  They talk about some others. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=204.4s)]
*  I just don't see Biden doing it [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=207.08s)]
*  from a physical or a mental standpoint. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=212.8s)]
*  But it's been a crazy period of time [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=214.4s)]
*  in the world of politics, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=216.84s)]
*  but he's surrounded by people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=218.96s)]
*  They expected Bernie to win. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=220.44s)]
*  Now, Bernie's older than Biden. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=223.4s)]
*  Whether you like him or not, he's sharp. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=225.28s)]
*  I watched him being interviewed the other day. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=226.84s)]
*  He's 100% sharp. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  He hasn't lost much, if anything, Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=230.4s)]
*  But he's older. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=233.28s)]
*  So it's not an age thing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  I just don't see him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=237.68s)]
*  So they're trying to prevent you [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=239.32s)]
*  from making it to the general election [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=241.76s)]
*  by tying you up in lawsuits, charging you with crimes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=243.84s)]
*  You've described the process. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  The old Soviet process. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=248.84s)]
*  The old Soviet process. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=250.44s)]
*  And you've described it as illegitimate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=251.88s)]
*  If this goes to trial and you get convicted, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  how would you respond in the middle of a presidential campaign? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=257.92s)]
*  How would you respond? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=259.92s)]
*  Well, it's so off. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=260.76s)]
*  Statute of limitations are years off. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=261.6s)]
*  It's hard to believe. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=264.24s)]
*  You know, usually when you have something like this, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=265.4s)]
*  the Democrats say, oh, he's terrible, guilty. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=270.64s)]
*  The Democrats have even said, I'm innocent. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=272.84s)]
*  I watched some of these, I think it was Andrew McCabe, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  the FBI guy who I fired. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=281.0s)]
*  He came out, he said, they've got no case. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=283.32s)]
*  They've all come out and said it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=286.56s)]
*  And then you've had Andrew McCarthy, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=288.88s)]
*  you've had Jonathan Tarly, Greg Jarrett, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=292.24s)]
*  Dershowitz, all of them. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=298.0s)]
*  Everybody, like, and they're, you know, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=299.36s)]
*  down the middle people, they see it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=301.68s)]
*  They say, there's no crime. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=303.6s)]
*  There's no, there's no anything. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=305.76s)]
*  Think of it, Tucker. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=307.48s)]
*  I've been through seven years of bulls**t investigations. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=308.32s)]
*  Seven years. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=312.6s)]
*  They've looked at, I have a very big company, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=314.0s)]
*  much bigger than they understand. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=316.92s)]
*  In fact, when they finally got my taxes, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=317.76s)]
*  they said, whoa, you know, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  it took them years to get the taxes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=321.44s)]
*  They got them, that was the last you ever heard. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=322.88s)]
*  You never heard one thing about them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=324.24s)]
*  But took them years to get them [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=327.04s)]
*  because they shouldn't be looking at my taxes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=328.92s)]
*  I was surprised that Supreme Court gave them the right. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=330.52s)]
*  They shouldn't be looking at people. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=332.48s)]
*  That's sort of another one of the tenants. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=333.76s)]
*  You don't do that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=335.88s)]
*  But I didn't care that much. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=337.72s)]
*  I just, on principle, I fought them. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=339.32s)]
*  And they looked, I built a great company [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=342.32s)]
*  when you do the things that I do [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=345.36s)]
*  and you employ thousands and thousands of people [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=348.56s)]
*  over the years, just thousands. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=351.08s)]
*  We've done a great job. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=352.64s)]
*  And then I ran for president. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=354.92s)]
*  People were surprised that I won. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=356.36s)]
*  But I used to see these rallies. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=357.64s)]
*  And I'll tell you, the rallies are bigger now [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=359.2s)]
*  that the enthusiasm is more now [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=360.68s)]
*  than I've ever seen, than I've ever seen. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=362.88s)]
*  So what do you think since your poll numbers [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=365.4s)]
*  have risen consistently since they rated this place, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=367.28s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=370.28s)]
*  Well, before they rated it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=371.12s)]
*  They were going up substantially before. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=372.56s)]
*  They definitely moved after that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  Since then, they've really been going up. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=375.92s)]
*  So how do you think that your opponents will respond? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=377.6s)]
*  I don't know how. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=384.24s)]
*  Well, we have two opponents. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  We have a primary opponent. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=386.12s)]
*  We have a general election opponent. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=387.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean the Democratic Party using the legal system. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, what they're doing is they're finding, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=391.44s)]
*  and think of this. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=393.88s)]
*  They say 11 million pages, but whatever it is, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=395.56s)]
*  through all of these Democrats' investigations. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=398.36s)]
*  I had the Mueller hoax. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=401.48s)]
*  I had impeachment hoax number one, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=403.28s)]
*  impeachment hoax number two, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=409.08s)]
*  You knew the Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=410.11999999999995s)]
*  I got that whole term from you. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=411.55999999999995s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=412.76s)]
*  You'd be screaming and I'd say, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=414.0s)]
*  this guy's a comedian. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=415.08s)]
*  But you remember that whole period of time. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=417.0s)]
*  Quite well. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=419.32s)]
*  It turned out to be a total fake. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  But think of this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=422.4s)]
*  You know, I tell this story very seldom, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=423.23999999999995s)]
*  because it's a sad story. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=425.08s)]
*  So the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=427.23999999999995s)]
*  was made up by Crooked Hillary Clinton, Adam Schiff, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=429.0s)]
*  the DNC, the Democrat Party. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=432.6s)]
*  The dossier is a total fake thing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=434.84s)]
*  We're suing them now, as you know, and that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=437.08s)]
*  We're suing them a lot because, unfortunately, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=439.16s)]
*  Bill Barr didn't have the courage [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=441.88s)]
*  to do what he should have done. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  He should have done. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=444.36s)]
*  He was so afraid of being impeached. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=445.2s)]
*  So I have to do it civilly. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=446.96s)]
*  I have to sue people. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=447.96s)]
*  The Justice Department should have done, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=449.4s)]
*  because these are criminals. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=450.8s)]
*  But think of this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=452.28s)]
*  So you have all of these millions and millions of pages, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=453.56s)]
*  and they get you on a non-dislosure agreement? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=459.08s)]
*  I mean, big numbers, billions and billions of dollars, right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=461.12s)]
*  And they get you on a perfect non-dislosure agreement, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=465.0s)]
*  or they get you on nothing. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=468.52s)]
*  A friend of mine who's a big business guy said, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=471.08s)]
*  you have to be the most honest guy in the world, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=472.68s)]
*  because with all of those numbers that you have [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=475.6s)]
*  and those big numbers, they don't have anything. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=477.88s)]
*  And you have to see, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=481.24s)]
*  take a look at the people I just mentioned. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=482.08s)]
*  Read what they said. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=484.16s)]
*  There was no crime. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=485.8s)]
*  In fact, a lot of people saying he indicted somebody. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=487.6s)]
*  There's no crime. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  That's illegal to do, you know what he did. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=492.32s)]
*  So I don't see it going. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=494.4s)]
*  I mean, we'll have to see. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=495.88s)]
*  So, but just to bottom line it, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=496.88s)]
*  I mean, the purpose of this is to keep you [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=499.08s)]
*  out of the presidential race. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=501.76s)]
*  If I weren't running, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=502.88s)]
*  or if I had bad poll numbers, let's say, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=504.35999999999996s)]
*  and again, remember, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  the Democrats are the party of disinformation. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=508.32s)]
*  If they want you to run, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=511.79999999999995s)]
*  if they want to run against somebody, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=512.9599999999999s)]
*  they're gonna go the opposite. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=516.6s)]
*  For instance, they don't wanna run against me. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=517.72s)]
*  And now, I just gave you a poll. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=519.52s)]
*  I'm nine points up on Biden. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=521.72s)]
*  But they're the party of disinformation. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=524.84s)]
*  So what they say is, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=526.52s)]
*  oh, we wanna run against Trump. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=527.36s)]
*  Now they always do that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=530.76s)]
*  You know, they do that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=531.6s)]
*  And other people would do it, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=532.64s)]
*  but they do it pretty much better than others. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=533.84s)]
*  Is there anything they could throw at you legally [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=535.56s)]
*  that would convince you to drop out of the race? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=537.96s)]
*  If you get convicted in this case in New York, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=539.6s)]
*  would you drop out? No, I'd never drop out. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=541.8s)]
*  No, I'd never drop. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=543.0s)]
*  It's not my thing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=544.0s)]
*  I wouldn't do it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjiBtpR2L4&t=544.84s)]
