# Tucker: AOC is just another stooge
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Thursday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=2.96s)]
*  Like all sorority girl narcissists, there is nothing the Congresswoman from New York's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=3.96s)]
*  14th congressional district enjoys more than giving herself new nicknames. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=8.56s)]
*  In high school in leafy Westchester County, she was known as Sandy Cortez. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=13.84s)]
*  We still call her that because of all her various pseudonyms, that one fits the best. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=18.48s)]
*  And then once she became a member of Congress, she adopted the august and faintly exotic [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  title Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which sounds like the name of one of Che's girlfriends [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=26.86s)]
*  in revolutionary Bolivia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=33.1s)]
*  You can just picture her in the back of the motorcycle in a beret. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=34.1s)]
*  And then once she ascended still higher and became a Kardashian, this very same person [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=38.68s)]
*  began going by simply AOC, Queen of TikTok. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=43.78s)]
*  But along the way, and most people do not know this, she had still another name. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=48.22s)]
*  During the 2018 Democratic primary, in which she beat party stalwart Joe Crowley by attacking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=53.18s)]
*  him for being white, Sandy Cortez went by the name Alex. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=58.48s)]
*  Just Alex, your friendly neighborhood gender non-specific bartender. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=63.34s)]
*  Alex. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=66.94s)]
*  On Alex's campaign website at the time, there was a section explaining what Alex believed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=68.42s)]
*  One of Alex's views read this way, quote, Alex believes that we must end the forever [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=73.14s)]
*  war by bringing our troops home and ending the airstrikes and bombings that perpetuate [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=77.7s)]
*  the cycle of terrorism and occupation throughout the world. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=82.36s)]
*  End quote. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=85.08s)]
*  Now, a few people noticed this because for a self-described progressive, that didn't [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=86.08s)]
*  seem like a very surprising position. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=90.24s)]
*  And on the day that Sandy Cortez, Alex beat Joe Crowley in the primary, that statement [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=92.48s)]
*  was still on her website. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=96.96s)]
*  But then it disappeared. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=98.92s)]
*  No one noticed except a journalist called Samira Khan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=101.16s)]
*  Hey, what happened to the anti-war part? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=104.08s)]
*  Now Alex, who by this point had morphed into Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, blamed the deletion [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=107.72s)]
*  of this position on her supporters, who she claimed were running the website and had done [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=113.52s)]
*  it accidentally. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=116.52s)]
*  Who knows what happened to it? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=117.52s)]
*  But Samira Khan sensed there might be more to the story. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=119.66s)]
*  How long, she asked at the time, will we be moaning on and on about single payer while [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=122.48s)]
*  there's bipartisan support for nuclear Armageddon? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Well that turned out to be a pretty good question, Samira Khan. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=132.0s)]
*  In fact, it's no longer a rhetorical question. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=135.28s)]
*  There is indeed now bipartisan support for nuclear Armageddon. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=137.84s)]
*  We're not making that up. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=141.24s)]
*  Joe Biden said it out loud at a fundraiser the other day. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=142.96s)]
*  Oh, by the way, nuclear Armageddon on the way. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=145.0s)]
*  Hmm, okay. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=147.04s)]
*  And then Republicans in Congress said nothing, which is to say they backed him up. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=148.04s)]
*  And Sandy Cortez? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=151.96s)]
*  She stayed totally silent. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=153.76s)]
*  And that really is the point. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=156.08s)]
*  Now, if you're watching this show, it's likely you don't really care what's going on in the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=157.32s)]
*  so-called progressive movement. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=161.08s)]
*  It's not one of your interests, and why would you care? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=162.88s)]
*  They're mostly trust-e-farian clowns. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  They're jokes, kids with weird hair, pointless liberal arts degrees, stupid fantasy-based [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=168.24s)]
*  politics. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=172.88s)]
*  That's who they are. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=173.88s)]
*  But it's also true that over time, people like this can be useful. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes you want principled people taking principled positions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=181.96s)]
*  It keeps the system in balance. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=186.6s)]
*  You need that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=188.2s)]
*  Not everyone can be a mercenary. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=189.2s)]
*  Otherwise, you wind up with what we have now, which is true insanity. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=191.8s)]
*  An ironclad consensus in Washington that we somehow have a moral obligation to destroy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=195.68s)]
*  ourselves and our children's future in an utterly pointless war against Russia. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  What? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=206.8s)]
*  Everyone seems to think that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=208.52s)]
*  And we mean everyone on both sides, from liberals like Nancy Pelosi to conservatives like Joni [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=210.08s)]
*  Ernst and everyone in between them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  And that's a huge problem because it's insane. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=218.02s)]
*  Everyone needs to say it's insane out loud and break the spell, the hypnotism. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  That would be the job of a so-called radical like Sandy Cortez. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=227.16s)]
*  That's why she exists. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=229.6s)]
*  Now, you may despise her. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=230.96s)]
*  Obviously, we do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=232.72s)]
*  We say so often. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=233.72s)]
*  But at certain key moments, people like that have a role. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  They stand up and they tell the essential truth. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  No, we should not go to war with Russia. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=240.12s)]
*  What are you kidding? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  This is lunacy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  Pull back. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  And if Sandy Cortez did that, it might actually help. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  It might actually save the country. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=249.08s)]
*  But that's not what Sandy Cortez is doing right now because it turns out she is not [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=251.68s)]
*  at all what she claims to be. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=255.0s)]
*  Sandy Cortez may hate white people. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=257.04s)]
*  Seems like she does. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  But that doesn't mean she's progressive, much less liberal in any meaningful sense. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=260.04s)]
*  No, she's the opposite. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  Turns out she's just another stooge. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=266.8s)]
*  Like Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, a willing tool of soulless corporate power who will [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  Google, JP Morgan and Raytheon against the working, the working people she claims to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=274.44s)]
*  represent. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=279.36s)]
*  On no subject is this more glaringly obvious than the Ukraine War. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=281.32s)]
*  That war provides absolutely no benefit of any kind to her constituents or, by the way, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=285.6s)]
*  to any other normal American. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=290.6s)]
*  For the people of Queens and the Bronx, that war is all downside. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=293.08s)]
*  No upside whatsoever. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=298.08s)]
*  So last night at a sparsely attended town hall in the Bronx, two of Sandy Cortez's constituents [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=300.08s)]
*  said that out loud. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=305.2s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=306.52s)]
*  Congresswoman, none of this matters unless there's a nuclear war, which you voted to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=307.52s)]
*  send arms and weapons to Ukraine. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, she's left the Democratic Party because there are no more hots. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=315.36s)]
*  OK, you originally voted, you ran as an outsider, yet you've been voting to start this war in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=320.84s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=327.08s)]
*  You're voting to start a third nuclear war with Russia and China. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=329.08s)]
*  Why are you playing with the lives of American citizens? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=332.08s)]
*  You're playing with our lives. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=335.08s)]
*  There will be no neighbors if there's a nuclear bomb. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=337.08s)]
*  You voted to mobilize and send money to Ukrainian Nazis. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=341.08s)]
*  You're a coward. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=345.08s)]
*  You're a progressive socialist. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=347.08s)]
*  Where are you against the war mobilization? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=349.08s)]
*  He's telling the right truth. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=351.08s)]
*  You have done nothing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=354.08s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard has shown guts where you've shown cowardice. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=356.08s)]
*  I believed in you and you became the very thing you sought to fight against. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=360.08s)]
*  That's what you've become. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=366.08s)]
*  You are the establishment and you are the reason why everybody will end up in a nuclear [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=368.08s)]
*  war unless you choose to stand up right now and denounce the Democratic Party. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=372.08s)]
*  We could be in a nuclear war at any minute and you continue to fund it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=378.08s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=383.08s)]
*  Why not right now? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=387.08s)]
*  Because you are the root to everything around us. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=389.08s)]
*  You're the liar here. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=393.08s)]
*  Okay, so those are actual progressives. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=395.08s)]
*  Now there's no doubt that on virtually any other issue we wouldn't agree with them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=398.08s)]
*  Don't know what their beliefs are. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=402.08s)]
*  Probably don't intersect with ours. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=404.08s)]
*  But on this specific issue, which does matter, they're absolutely right. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=406.08s)]
*  Sandy Cortez is not a radical. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=411.08s)]
*  She's not a progressive. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=412.08s)]
*  She is a neocon, just like everybody else. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=414.08s)]
*  She is a tool of the people with power, obviously. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=417.08s)]
*  They can see that clearly because it's true. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=423.08s)]
*  Her response, you are being rude. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=425.08s)]
*  You're being rude now, says the very same Sandy Cortez who instructed activists to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=428.08s)]
*  terrorize their political opponents. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=433.08s)]
*  Quote, the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=436.08s)]
*  Oh, is that right? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=441.08s)]
*  So they were kind of following your instructions, weren't they? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=444.08s)]
*  The protesters you just saw use Sandy Cortez's preferred tactics against her. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=448.08s)]
*  They immediately seized the moral high ground and they started yelling. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=453.08s)]
*  And they got no response from Sandy Cortez. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=457.08s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=459.08s)]
*  Because she has nothing to say. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=460.08s)]
*  They're onto her. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=461.08s)]
*  They know who she really is and she knows that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=462.08s)]
*  They were right. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=467.08s)]
*  Shortly after she took office, Sandy Cortez funded the largest expansion of our [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=468.08s)]
*  nation's military ever. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=472.08s)]
*  In 2019, she approved and unprecedented $738 billion military budget. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=473.08s)]
*  Now, publicly, Sandy Cortez never justified this vote. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=479.08s)]
*  Instead, she kept demonizing the military. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=482.08s)]
*  She was funding, right? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=483.08s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=484.08s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=485.08s)]
*  I don't believe our whole nation's priority is to slaughter people in other parts of the world. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=486.08s)]
*  I think it is a priority of a powerful and concentrated class in the United States that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=492.08s)]
*  happens to have a grip of control over our government. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=497.08s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=501.08s)]
*  So that was the TikTok approved version. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=502.08s)]
*  That was for all the college kids on social media. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=505.08s)]
*  But in real life, she didn't mean a word of it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=509.08s)]
*  The only part she meant was America is terrible. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=513.0799999999999s)]
*  She does believe that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=515.0799999999999s)]
*  She does hate the country. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  But pulling back from a war that will hurt the country, where would she do that? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=518.08s)]
*  She doesn't like the country. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=522.08s)]
*  Anything that's not in our interest, she's completely for. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=523.08s)]
*  And that's why this year, Sandy Cortez, along with every member of the squad, the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=526.08s)]
*  progressives, voted to approve another massive $40 billion military spending bill. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=530.08s)]
*  Cori Bush even voted for it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=535.08s)]
*  Even after she admitted it would directly contribute to, quote, the increased risks of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=537.08s)]
*  direct war and the potential for direct military confrontation between Russia and the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=541.08s)]
*  U.S. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=546.08s)]
*  So even Cori Bush, probably the lowest IQ member of the United States Congress, it [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=547.08s)]
*  was pretty obvious where this was going. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=551.08s)]
*  It was going to war with Russia. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=553.08s)]
*  But she voted for it anyway. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=557.08s)]
*  They all did. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=558.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, the leaders of the Democratic Party tried to sell this, which is again a step [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=560.08s)]
*  toward war, which does not help us in any way, only hurts us as a humanitarian effort. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=563.08s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=569.08s)]
*  Today, we are voting to provide nearly $40 billion to address the immediate and near-term [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=570.08s)]
*  security, economic and humanitarian needs of the Ukrainian people. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=577.08s)]
*  We are morally obligated to ensure the brave Ukrainian fighters and the Ukrainian people [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=582.08s)]
*  have the security and economic aid that they need. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=588.08s)]
*  What we're doing here is very important, supplying weaponry and security assistance, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=592.08s)]
*  government and economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=597.08s)]
*  This supplemental appropriation bill is a down payment on the security and success of [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=600.08s)]
*  democracy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=607.08s)]
*  Glory to Ukraine. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=608.08s)]
*  We want the victory for Ukraine and we want defeat for Vladimir Putin. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=609.08s)]
*  Regime change would be great, but we realize that that will not happen, but defeat must [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=613.08s)]
*  happen. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=618.08s)]
*  Oh, so it's humanitarian assistance. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=621.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=624.08s)]
*  Did you look at the bill? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=625.08s)]
*  No. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=626.08s)]
*  It was a military funding bill. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=627.08s)]
*  The real point of it was buying arms. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=629.08s)]
*  More than half of it, $24 billion, went to military equipment, weapons. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=632.08s)]
*  $19 billion went directly to the war effort in Ukraine. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=637.08s)]
*  So, okay, if you're an out of the closet neocon, this makes sense, but if you're Sandy Cortez, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=641.08s)]
*  who's all over TikTok talking about the working people fighting the man, what does this tell [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=648.08s)]
*  you about her? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=653.08s)]
*  She doesn't care about the people she claims to represent. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=654.08s)]
*  She is contempt for them. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=656.08s)]
*  She talks about their misery only to leverage it for her own benefit. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=658.08s)]
*  She hoards power in their name. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=662.08s)]
*  They are merely the tools of her personal advancement. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=664.08s)]
*  They're not her real constituency. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=667.08s)]
*  How could they be? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=669.08s)]
*  They don't benefit from this. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=670.08s)]
*  Her real constituency is NBC News, the editors at Teen Vogue, and Vladimir Zelensky, the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=671.08s)]
*  celebrity endorsed dictator of the most corrupt nation in Europe. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=677.08s)]
*  Zelensky is now shaking down our cowardly Congress for more cash at the very moment [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=680.08s)]
*  our own economy and our own borders are collapsing. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=685.08s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=689.08s)]
*  At this time, we have two key financial needs of the country. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=690.08s)]
*  That's $38 billion to make up for the deficit of our budget for next year. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=694.08s)]
*  And other $17 billion that were verified by the World Bank and needed to rebuild the critical [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=701.08s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=708.08s)]
*  We need also targeted credits in the amount of $2 billion to rebuild the electric energy [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=709.08s)]
*  infrastructure after the destruction and to expand our export to Europe. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=717.08s)]
*  We need credit limits to purchase gas and coal for the future heating season. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=723.08s)]
*  The scope of this year's support should be not less than $5 billion. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=731.08s)]
*  What? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=739.08s)]
*  Some uppity foreigner in a t-shirt demanding money for his critical economic needs? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=740.08s)]
*  We have critical economic needs too, buddy. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=747.08s)]
*  Who are you, troll? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=749.08s)]
*  Go away. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=750.08s)]
*  What? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=751.08s)]
*  Since when does that guy have a claim on our treasury? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=752.08s)]
*  So this is the job of people like Sandy Cortez to remind us again to break the spell of hypnosis [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=756.08s)]
*  the U.S. Congress is under. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=763.08s)]
*  We don't owe this guy anything. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=764.08s)]
*  Not one thing. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=766.08s)]
*  Good luck, pal. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=767.08s)]
*  That's it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=768.08s)]
*  And as our economy degrades and our border is gone, that guy's lecturing us with some [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=769.08s)]
*  Christmas list like I want this, that, and I want a bicycle too. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=774.08s)]
*  You better send it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=777.08s)]
*  Quick. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=778.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=779.08s)]
*  Up yours, buddy. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=780.08s)]
*  And at the same time dragging us, the entire West, toward nuclear war telling us we have [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=781.08s)]
*  to nuke Russia. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=785.08s)]
*  And what does Sandy Cortez do? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=786.08s)]
*  She affirms it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=788.08s)]
*  She's not a progressive. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=789.08s)]
*  She's a stealthy neocon operative. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=790.08s)]
*  The entire leadership of the so-called progressive movement is that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=794.08s)]
*  They're totally and utterly corrupt. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=798.08s)]
*  Has anyone on the left pointing this out? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=801.08s)]
*  Has Cenk Uygur, Uyghur, said a word about it? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=803.08s)]
*  The so-called radicals at Chapo Trap House? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=805.08s)]
*  The Atlantic Magazine, NPR, MSNBC, or these left-wing media organizations always telling [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=808.08s)]
*  you how deeply they care about oppressed peoples? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=812.08s)]
*  All of them calling for radical race war every day. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=814.08s)]
*  But when actual civilization-ending war looms on the horizon, they're cheering for it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=818.08s)]
*  Right alongside the Pentagon. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=823.08s)]
*  We're going to stay with our efforts to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=825.08s)]
*  We will not waver from our commitment to support Ukraine as long as it takes. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=831.08s)]
*  We will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=837.08s)]
*  You're already north of $15 billion in terms of those commitments. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=841.08s)]
*  How far do you go? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=845.08s)]
*  As long as it takes. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=846.08s)]
*  As long as it takes to do what? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=848.08s)]
*  Has anyone even asked that question? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=850.08s)]
*  Has Sandy Cortez asked that question? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=852.08s)]
*  Have your progressive pals asked that question? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=854.08s)]
*  As long as it takes to do what? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=856.08s)]
*  How long is that? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=857.08s)]
*  What's the goal? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=858.08s)]
*  And at what cost? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=859.08s)]
*  And what's the risk? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=861.08s)]
*  Should we weigh those? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=863.08s)]
*  No. As long as it takes. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=865.08s)]
*  Why? Because they're getting more powerful. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=867.08s)]
*  Even as our country is getting less powerful by the day. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=868.08s)]
*  So we're the real liberals. We're the real progressives. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=872.08s)]
*  We're the real progressives. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theoRnX1NT0&t=876.08s)]
