# Tucker: This is a middle finger in your face
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E)
*  So you vote for a political party and you have no right to expect they'll do everything you want [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=0.0s)]
*  or that their views will be exactly the same as yours. You may send them money and loyally [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=4.72s)]
*  support them, but of course there's going to be some divergence between what you want them to do [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=8.64s)]
*  and what they actually end up doing. But for a party just weeks after taking office, in this case [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=11.84s)]
*  Republicans in the House, to flip 180 degrees on two of the biggest topics in American life, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=17.68s)]
*  that's kind of a middle finger right in your face, isn't it? Here are a couple of examples. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=24.64s)]
*  The new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul of Texas, just [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=30.16s)]
*  announced on CNN over the weekend that any Republican who opposes sending billions more [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=34.8s)]
*  to Ukraine needs to be quote educated on why the borders in Ukraine matter a whole lot more than [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=39.84s)]
*  our borders here. Watch. A lot of members of your conference, fellow Republicans, they want to stop [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  giving money to Ukraine. Should Ukraine be worried that the money is going to stop coming from the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=52.24s)]
*  U.S.? No, no. I think there's enough support on both sides of the aisle, majority in the Democratic [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=57.76s)]
*  Party, majority in the Republican, the national security chairman like myself support this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=64.48s)]
*  We have to educate our members. I don't think they quite understand what is at stake. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=70.48s)]
*  So it was just right before the last election in November that Michael McCaul, that guy, was saying [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=76.16s)]
*  no we really should audit all these billions we've sent to Zelensky and his wife in Ukraine, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=80.56s)]
*  we have no idea where the money went and we should know before we send more. Now he's just [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=85.92s)]
*  saying no. The only group in America doesn't need to worry, you have to worry, you can't afford eggs, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=89.52s)]
*  but Zelensky and his wife don't have to worry because we're never going to stop sending them [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=94.64s)]
*  billions of dollars. Then he went on to demand the Biden administration send M1 tanks to Ukraine [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=98.64s)]
*  because that's the part, not to our border, of his state over which over seven million people have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=105.92s)]
*  come in the last two years. No tanks on our border, but tanks for Ukraine's border. They don't have to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=110.8s)]
*  worry. And Lindsey Graham of course agrees. Lindsey Graham got completely unhinged visiting [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=115.36s)]
*  his real constituents in Kiev over the weekend. Watch this. All three of us, Republicans and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=121.52s)]
*  Democrats share the same goal. For Ukraine to drive the Russians out of Ukraine. To achieve that goal, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=127.52s)]
*  the Ukraine military needs tanks. I'm tired of this show surrounding who's going to send tanks [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=144.8s)]
*  and when they're going to send them. Of course Germany could pay for it, Europe could pay for it, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=157.84s)]
*  Ukraine is in Europe, but there's Lindsey Graham standing between the two most left-wing members [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  of the United States Senate demanding that you pay for it after a full year. They lied to you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  for a year and told you where Ukraine was winning. Now they're conceding Ukraine is losing and you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  have to double your commitment to Ukraine. Wow, they really don't care about you, do they? At all. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=178.0s)]
*  And just to underscore how little they care, a few days ago the new chairman of the House Financial [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Services Committee, a Republican from North Carolina called Patrick McHenry, announced that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  one of the biggest problems with American finance today, the thing he's worried most about, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=192.32s)]
*  is that too many white men work in banking. This fact, this overabundance of male whiteness, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  is apparently pressing emergency. So Congresswoman McHenry directed all six of the financial services [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=206.32s)]
*  subcommittees to get to work fighting whiteness. The subcommittee on housing and insurance, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=212.24s)]
*  for example, focused on quote policies that continue to strengthen diversity and inclusion [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=217.6s)]
*  in the housing industry. How about just housing for American citizens? No, it's got to be race-based, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=221.6s)]
*  according to Congressman McHenry. In the case of the subcommittee on oversight, diversity and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=226.64s)]
*  inclusion were the only specific oversight focuses that were listed. Now what is this? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=231.6s)]
*  We asked. We called around Capitol Hill and one person with knowledge of the decision-making [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=239.04s)]
*  told us that Congressman McHenry is doing this because he does not want to upset Maxine Waters. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  That would be the ranking Democrat on the committee and a person with a long history [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=248.72s)]
*  of making hateful and violent statements about white people. So Maxine Waters is an out of the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=252.64s)]
*  closet racist. She's an accomplished hater, but Congressman Patrick McHenry of North Carolina [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=256.8s)]
*  is anxious to placate her. Not you, her, Maxine Waters. Now why? Why is he so anxious to make [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=262.08s)]
*  Maxine Waters happy? We reached out to Congressman McHenry's office today to invite him on the show [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=268.56s)]
*  to explain. He of course declined. That offer is always open. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9S-_QiM93E&t=272.32s)]
