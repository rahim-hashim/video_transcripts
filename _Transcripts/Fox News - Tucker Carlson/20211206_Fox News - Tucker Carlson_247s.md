# Candace Owens blasts Jussie Smollett's lies as actor takes the stand
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk)
*  So cameras were not allowed in the courtroom today or obviously we'd have a lot of amazing footage for you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=0.0s)]
*  But we do have some idea of what Jussie Smollett was saying because he hasn't really changed what he has been saying for the past three [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=6.18s)]
*  years so back in 2019 he argued that only [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=13.14s)]
*  Racist wouldn't take his story at face value [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=17.48s)]
*  If I had said [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=21.84s)]
*  It was a Muslim or Mexican [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=24.48s)]
*  Or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more a lot more and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=27.0s)]
*  That says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now the fact that we have these fear Mongrels [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=35.28s)]
*  these people that are [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=42.0s)]
*  Trying to separate us and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=45.0s)]
*  It's just not okay [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=49.68s)]
*  Fear Mongrels [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=52.56s)]
*  They were a problem then they're a problem now [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=55.56s)]
*  Candice Owens is the host of Candice. She's been following all this for a couple years now [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=58.0s)]
*  She joins us with her reaction Candice. It is great to see today. What do you make of this? Oh [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=62.78s)]
*  Wow, I mean honestly I make that his his defense should have actually said [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=68.60000000000001s)]
*  Plot insanity and I would have bought it like when you listen to the story you really follow every element of this like [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=73.88s)]
*  Jussie Smollett is not a sane person and what people are forgetting is that he's asking you to believe you know [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=78.36s)]
*  There's this thing called Occam's razor right usually the simplest explanation is the best explanation [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=83.38s)]
*  He is asking you to believe it's just an incredible set of circumstances took place here [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  He wants you to believe how many black people do you think go through? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=91.78s)]
*  Two hate crimes in one week that somebody sent him a letter to onset like the zodiac killer right cutting out every single letter [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=94.3s)]
*  And it was from you know signed MAGA right because it's all about Donald Trump was signed MAGA [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=101.74s)]
*  The police say actually this came from Jussie right and then just five days later [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=106.3s)]
*  Jussie Smollett goes to get a subway sandwich and some eggs at Walgreens at 1 a.m. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=110.14s)]
*  In the morning on a frigid night, and what do you know some MAGA supporters jump out? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=114.34s)]
*  He doesn't recognize the voice of his lover right the person that he has a sexual relationship with right [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=118.34s)]
*  He wants you to believe all of these circumstances his lovers lying on him [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  He didn't he couldn't see at night that these were actually two tall [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=127.58s)]
*  Nigerian black men the police department has it against him the person that was in the ride-along is lying about what happened [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=131.78s)]
*  He never said they were wearing a MAGA hat the police chief is lying on him [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=138.28s)]
*  I mean you have to be an absolute fool to believe anything else than what is plainly in front of us [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=141.48s)]
*  Jussie Smollett lied it is actually the greatest racial hoax that has taken place at least in the last three decades [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=146.2s)]
*  Right he should face way deeper charge that he's facing right now waste deeper charges [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=152.28s)]
*  It's actually in my opinion Kim Fox should be on the stand you know for less than the charge that are against him [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=156.68s)]
*  Well, so you wonder I mean what's so in I get third the infuriating part of this is look you got caught [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=162.48s)]
*  You're busted you did it [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=168.6s)]
*  It's kind of insulting to the rest of us to pretend you didn't when clearly you did and moreover you wonder [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=171.28s)]
*  What percentage of the population will believe that he was framed or whatever? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=178.84s)]
*  Absolutely nobody believes this nobody believes this but just seeing the people that want him to get off and his solution is I told [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=184.92s)]
*  A really big lie, so I'm just gonna tell an even bigger lie to try to get away with it, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=190.76s)]
*  I'm gonna move from one conspiracy theory to the next and the last thing I'll say here Tucker [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=194.6s)]
*  It's just imagine if the races were reversed imagine if two white men pretended that two black men had attacked them [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=197.8s)]
*  What would the media be saying right now? What would be the charges? What would be the demands right now? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  This is incredibly racist what he did right incredibly racist meant to cause racial division in this country at the end of the day [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  He's gonna get a light tap on the wrist if he even gets that I would never defend any of this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  I wish Robin Roberts of ABC the ever credulous was on the stand today [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=221.58s)]
*  See if she's changed her mind about this Candace Owens that she hasn't great to see you. Thank you so much [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmJxCYKizk&t=226.70000000000002s)]
