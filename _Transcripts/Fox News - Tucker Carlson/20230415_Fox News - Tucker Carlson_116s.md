# A first look at 'Tucker Carlson Originals: O, Canada!'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A)
*  Welcome back from the Fox studio lot in Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=0.0s)]
*  We're happy to be here for more than 100 years. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=7.16s)]
*  The United States has as a matter of official policy, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  opposed dictatorships around the world. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=12.16s)]
*  But what if tyranny arrived right next door? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=14.92s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  And what would our government do in response? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=19.52s)]
*  Would we liberate the people living under [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=21.96s)]
*  authoritarian rule as we have around the world? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=24.3s)]
*  That is the topic of our upcoming Tucker Carlson [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=26.66s)]
*  Originals documentary, Oh Canada. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=29.2s)]
*  Here's a first look at what we found. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  The cost of freedom is always high, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=35.84s)]
*  but Americans have always paid it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=38.6s)]
*  Some nations may be able to turn a blind eye [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=41.36s)]
*  to atrocities in other countries. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=43.84s)]
*  The United States of America is different. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=45.92s)]
*  Fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=47.76s)]
*  is considerable. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=51.76s)]
*  Don't go now! [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=54.08s)]
*  Roger, Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  Oh mankind. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=60.2s)]
*  We like to say people kind. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=62.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=63.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=64.92s)]
*  The police then moved in and arrested me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=69.72s)]
*  Bye, daddy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=72.16s)]
*  In the entire time that I was in prison. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=73.84s)]
*  They shot me point blank. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=77.76s)]
*  My mouth, my nose, my eyes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  I received bruise. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  My hands were bleeding. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=85.4s)]
*  The police shouldn't arrest right now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=86.4s)]
*  I was arrested and cuffed and put in jail. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=87.44s)]
*  Open! [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=90.88s)]
*  Open! [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=91.88s)]
*  Open! [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=92.88s)]
*  The greatest danger of all would be to do nothing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=93.88s)]
*  We care about saving innocent lives. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=96.48s)]
*  The tyrant will soon be gone. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=98.72s)]
*  The day of your liberation is near. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSSAu20f0A&t=101.4s)]
