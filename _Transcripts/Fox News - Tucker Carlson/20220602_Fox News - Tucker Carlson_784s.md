# Tucker Carlson: Democrats are not serious about protecting you
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight this is a Fox News alert facing almost certain defeat for his party in the midterm [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=2.0s)]
*  elections five months from now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=7.28s)]
*  Joe Biden has become desperate. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=8.76s)]
*  He's decided to leverage the murder of 19 children in Texas last week for political [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=10.8s)]
*  advantage. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=16.88s)]
*  He just spoke at some length from the White House about the need to disarm the population. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=17.88s)]
*  We're going to spare you all of it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=22.76s)]
*  We've taken a few select sound bites that sum up the president's message. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=24.04s)]
*  Here they are. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=27.96s)]
*  An amendment like all other rights is not absolute. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=29.64s)]
*  This isn't about taking to anyone's rights. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=32.8s)]
*  It's about protecting children. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=34.56s)]
*  It's about protecting families. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=36.56s)]
*  It's about protecting whole communities. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=38.72s)]
*  It's about protecting our freedoms to go to school, to a grocery store, to a church [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  without being shot and killed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=47.92s)]
*  We need to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=49.92s)]
*  And if we can't ban assault weapons, then we should raise the aides to purchase them [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  from 18 to 21. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=58.8s)]
*  Strengthen background checks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=61.48s)]
*  Enact safe storage law and red flag laws. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=63.72s)]
*  Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=67.36s)]
*  Address the mental health crisis, deepening the trauma of gun violence and as a consequence [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=72.52s)]
*  of that violence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=80.08s)]
*  These are rational, common sense measures. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=82.28s)]
*  If Congress fails, I believe this time a majority of the American people won't give up either. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=85.84s)]
*  I believe the majority of you will act. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=91.2s)]
*  So to summarize the president's remarks tonight, your constitutional rights are not absolute. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=94.72s)]
*  But in taking them away, we're not actually taking away your rights. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=99.64s)]
*  We're protecting children, to which you might ask, am I a threat to children? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  That question is never answered by the president. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=106.86s)]
*  The point of this, of course, is to disarm people who did not vote for Joe Biden. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=111.32s)]
*  And that is why simultaneous with this, this effort to recategorize the guns in your closet [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=115.7s)]
*  as felonies, Democrats have been failing to prosecute gun crimes in our cities where most [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=121.34s)]
*  of the crime is. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=128.34s)]
*  And if you're at all confused about whether the effort here is selective, if this is enforcement [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=130.14s)]
*  only at certain people, you'll notice the president never mentioned the apparent federal [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=137.1s)]
*  gun felony his own son committed when he lied on a federal background form when he bought [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=141.46s)]
*  a handgun. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=146.74s)]
*  Didn't mention that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=148.5s)]
*  Justice Department has completely ignored it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=149.5s)]
*  Instead, Biden's fellow Democrats in the House of Representatives spent the day debating [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  ways to disarm you, Americans who have committed no crime at all and want only to protect themselves [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=155.42s)]
*  and their families. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=160.44s)]
*  Democrats plan to criminalize possession of what they're calling large capacity ammunition [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=161.94s)]
*  feeding devices. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=165.82s)]
*  That is specifically any magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=167.5s)]
*  Well, as it turns out, that is most magazines in the United States. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  Tens of millions of Americans right now have so-called high capacity magazines in their [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  homes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=180.34s)]
*  They're not militia members. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=181.34s)]
*  They're not gun nuts. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=182.34s)]
*  They are normal people. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=183.34s)]
*  And the reason they have them is because most modern handguns and rifles use that type of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  magazine, the kind that Joe Biden is telling you is threatening and esoteric. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  These same firearms, the ones in your house right now, will not accept the kind of diminished [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=195.66s)]
*  magazines Joe Biden is demanding you use. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=199.98s)]
*  And that means, in effect, all of those guns will be banned. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=202.82s)]
*  Which guns specifically? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=208.1s)]
*  Well, for example, the Glock 19, probably the most popular handgun in the United States. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=209.1s)]
*  The Glock 19 comes from the manufacturer with a 15 round magazine. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=213.14s)]
*  Now, the Glock 19 is not an especially scary firearm. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=216.58s)]
*  It's a workman-like pistol. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=219.9s)]
*  If you have any interest in guns at all, you probably already own one. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=221.66s)]
*  But under this bill, the Glock 19 would be banned, illegal, a felony sitting in your [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=224.9s)]
*  bedside table. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=229.86s)]
*  And so would many other popular firearms in the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=230.86s)]
*  Now, this is about saving the children, Joe Biden just told us. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=233.5s)]
*  But how many lives would this new law save? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=236.82s)]
*  Well, we know the answer. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=239.38s)]
*  Zero, not one. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=241.38s)]
*  We know that because there is precisely no evidence at all, and never has been, that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=243.62s)]
*  larger magazines somehow inspire mass shootings. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=247.1s)]
*  But of course, saving lives is not the point of this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=249.94s)]
*  Disarming you is the point. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=252.70000000000002s)]
*  Florida Congressman Greg Stube tried to explain that at a hearing today of the House Judiciary [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=254.58s)]
*  Committee. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=258.22s)]
*  Watch how this unfolded. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=259.22s)]
*  Here's a gun I carry every single day to protect myself, my family, my wife, my home. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=260.22s)]
*  Comes with a 15 round magazine. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=267.22s)]
*  Here's a seven round magazine, which would be less than what would be lawful under this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=269.3s)]
*  bill if this bill were to come law. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=274.1s)]
*  It doesn't fit. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=276.02000000000004s)]
*  So this gun would be banned. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=277.26s)]
*  I hope the gun is not loaded. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=278.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm at my house. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=282.1s)]
*  I'll do whatever I want with my guns. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=283.5s)]
*  So you heard a voice in the background. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=286.42s)]
*  Greg Stube obviously knows his way around firearms. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  That was his gun. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=290.86s)]
*  But off camera, you heard Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas interrupting Greg Stube to tell him [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  how to handle a firearm in his own home. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  So was Sheila Jackson Lee a gun instructor? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=300.48s)]
*  Now, what does she know about firearms? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=302.1s)]
*  Well, glad you asked. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  Sheila Jackson Lee is the person who once explained to us that AR-15s shoot 50 caliber [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=305.42s)]
*  and weigh more than, quote, 10 boxes, whatever that means. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=311.18s)]
*  So Sheila Jackson Lee knows literally nothing about firearms. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=315.94s)]
*  And yet she plans without shame to regulate them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=320.82s)]
*  But only regulate your guns. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  Sheila Jackson Lee has no intention of disarming her own bodyguards, for example, or her own [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=326.1s)]
*  constituents. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=330.62s)]
*  The Democrats' bill contains an explicit exemption for bodyguards. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=331.62s)]
*  Even Sheila Jackson Lee understands that the people protecting her family may need a lot [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=335.78s)]
*  more than 10 rounds. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=339.64s)]
*  And most of them carry that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=341.52s)]
*  As the Washington Post put it, quote, American law enforcement officers ubiquitously carry [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=342.52s)]
*  handguns with more than 10 rounds of ammunition and often more than 15. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=346.86s)]
*  It is also why their rifles typically have 20 or 30 round magazines, not 10. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  Now why would Sheila Jackson Lee's bodyguards need all of those bullets? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  Why would anybody need all of those bullets, as Chuck Schumer often asks rhetorically? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  And the answer, of course, is because it's a dangerous world. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=366.04s)]
*  And if you're serious about protecting the people you love, you will be serious about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  the firearm you carry. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  But it turns out, and we know this for a fact now, Democrats are not serious about protecting [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  you or your family. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=378.8s)]
*  And that's why they defunded your police and called you a racist for complaining about [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  it as your city collapsed. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=384.76s)]
*  What they care about deeply, what they care about more than anything at all, is protecting [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=386.88s)]
*  themselves. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=390.44s)]
*  And that's why their bodyguards will continue to get any kind of magazines they want. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=392.06s)]
*  And what they want are high capacity magazines. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=396.54s)]
*  Democrats spent the rest of the day trying to figure out how to ban what Joe Biden has [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=400.02s)]
*  called ghost guns. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=403.14s)]
*  Ghost guns, they're scary. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=405.3s)]
*  Well several states, it turns out, have already tried to ban ghost guns, but every state that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=406.94s)]
*  has has run into the same problem. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=410.28s)]
*  No one can say what a ghost gun is. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=413.06s)]
*  It's a made up term. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=416.36s)]
*  It has no meaning. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=417.58s)]
*  As a judge in Nevada put it late last year when he struck down a ban on so-called ghost [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=419.2s)]
*  guns, quote, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=422.64s)]
*  Nevadans would face the risk of discriminatory enforcement by police and prosecutors alike [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=424.0s)]
*  as they, in their sole discretion and without guidance, could label almost anything, an [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=428.56s)]
*  unfinished frame or receiver, if it in any way resembles a firearm's undefined frame [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  or lower receiver. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=438.76s)]
*  In other words, any gun could be a ghost gun if Democratic operatives say it is. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=439.76s)]
*  And of course, that's the way they like it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=445.4s)]
*  The bill before Congress defines ghost gun as a firearm, including certain firearm parts [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=447.7s)]
*  that does not have a unique serial number engraved by a licensed manufacturer. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=452.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=456.7s)]
*  But the question is, which part of a firearm should require engraved serial numbers? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=457.9s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=464.65999999999997s)]
*  On that question hangs whether or not your possession of this object is a felony or legal. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  Now according to the bill, any quote, essential component of the firearm would require an [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=472.82s)]
*  engraved serial number. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=478.5s)]
*  But here's the point. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=479.58s)]
*  Merrick Garland gets to make the call. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=481.02s)]
*  This bill grants Merrick Garland, who is a craven and ruthless partisan, we know that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=484.16s)]
*  for a fact at this point, grants Merrick Garland the sole authority to define what an essential [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=488.26s)]
*  component is. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=493.6s)]
*  And if Merrick Garland decides you've got a quote, essential component that does not [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=495.66s)]
*  have an engraved serial number, you're going to jail. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=498.58s)]
*  See how this works? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=501.9s)]
*  So once again, the point is not to stop school shootings. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=503.41999999999996s)]
*  There's never been a school shooting with a so-called ghost gun. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=506.21999999999997s)]
*  If you were interested in stopping school shootings, and all of us should be, you would [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=509.84s)]
*  take a serious look at why they happen in the first place. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=512.74s)]
*  What do the people who commit them have in common? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=515.76s)]
*  But no one in Congress, particularly the Democratic side, is doing that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=518.5799999999999s)]
*  So this isn't an attempt to stop school shootings. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=523.02s)]
*  It's not an attempt to make this a safer country. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=526.3s)]
*  This is exactly what it looks like. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=528.86s)]
*  The beginning of a plan to confiscate and criminalize firearms in the hands of the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=531.18s)]
*  law-abiding in this country. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=535.64s)]
*  And if you doubt that, no, Nancy Pelosi has already announced she's going to introduce [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  legislation banning so-called assault weapons next week. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=541.2199999999999s)]
*  Oh, assault weapons. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=544.4599999999999s)]
*  What's an assault weapon? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=545.66s)]
*  Any gun that Nancy Pelosi's bodyguards have that you should not be allowed to have. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=547.0999999999999s)]
*  And there's also a new quote, red flag law in progress. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  Now that law would allow the government to seize firearms from anybody it wants, whether [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=554.42s)]
*  or not they committed a crime. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=559.66s)]
*  You know, under our current system, you have to be convicted in order to be punished. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=561.14s)]
*  But under the red flag laws, if someone doesn't like the cut of your jib, you lose your constitutional [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=564.98s)]
*  rights. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=569.46s)]
*  Now that's baldly unconstitutional. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=570.46s)]
*  And you know it is because Democrats are suddenly talking about packing the Supreme Court in [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=573.8s)]
*  order to make it law. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=577.86s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=579.34s)]
*  You will not stop us from advancing the Protecting Our Kids Act today. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  You will not stop us from passing it in the House next week, and you will not stop us [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=584.92s)]
*  there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=589.02s)]
*  If the filibuster obstructs us, we will abolish it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=590.82s)]
*  If the Supreme Court objects, we will expand it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=595.2600000000001s)]
*  And we will not rest until we have taken weapons of war out of circulation in our communities. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=598.5400000000001s)]
*  Each and every day we will do whatever it takes to end gun violence, whatever it takes. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=604.4200000000001s)]
*  In our communities. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=611.3000000000001s)]
*  Really, what's the murder rate in your community, pal? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=612.3000000000001s)]
*  And what exactly have you done to make it better? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=614.0600000000001s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=617.5400000000001s)]
*  Mondaire Jones wants power. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=619.3s)]
*  They all do. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=621.02s)]
*  And to that end, he wants to end the filibuster, destroy the entire judiciary, to quote, end [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=622.02s)]
*  gun violence. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=626.38s)]
*  A move like that raises a lot of questions. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=628.9799999999999s)]
*  For example, does Mondaire Jones have any idea what he's talking about? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=630.8599999999999s)]
*  Like the details, because you're a lawmaker. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=634.26s)]
*  Fox's Hillary Vaughn caught up with him today. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=637.3399999999999s)]
*  She wanted to know what weapons of war he intends to ban. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=639.3s)]
*  This is a revealing exchange. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=642.7199999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=644.9399999999999s)]
*  You mentioned you want weapons of war out of circulation. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=646.7800000000001s)]
*  What is a weapon of war to you? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=649.74s)]
*  Assault weapons. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=651.62s)]
*  Assault weapons. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=652.62s)]
*  So is that like semi-automatic handguns and rifles? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=653.62s)]
*  Semi-automatic weapons would qualify as assault weapons. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=657.22s)]
*  And these are things that should be banned. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=662.34s)]
*  Almost take almost every gun out of people's hands. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=663.86s)]
*  I mean, true. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, handguns, for example, would not qualify under what I just described. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=668.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=674.3000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=675.3s)]
*  So yes, Mondaire Jones just explained, yeah, all semi-automatic weapons. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=676.3s)]
*  To which Hillary Vaughn says, yeah, handguns, yeah, handguns. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=683.3s)]
*  So you want to take everyone's handguns away? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=685.3s)]
*  No, handguns wouldn't qualify as assault weapons. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=687.0999999999999s)]
*  Even though he just defined assault weapons as any quote semi-automatic weapon. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=690.9s)]
*  So clearly Mondaire Jones knows what Hillary Vaughn was trying to tell him that most firearms [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=696.6999999999999s)]
*  in this country, including most handguns, are quote semi-automatic weapons. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=701.5s)]
*  Including only have 22 calibers that aren't causing a ton of school shootings. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=705.22s)]
*  But when Hillary Vaughn points this out, Mondaire Jones runs away and probably not back to his [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=710.94s)]
*  district to lower the murder rate. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=715.34s)]
*  He just didn't want to get into details. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=716.78s)]
*  So what are we looking at here? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=719.66s)]
*  Well, today, a guy on Twitter called Spike Cohen summed it up pretty nicely. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=720.66s)]
*  Here's what he wrote. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=724.42s)]
*  Quote, the US government has been arming Ukraine because they're allies. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=725.42s)]
*  The US government has been seeking to disarm Russia because they're opponents. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=729.4200000000001s)]
*  In totally unrelated news, the US government seeks to disarm you. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=733.86s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=737.98s)]
*  That's the framing. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=739.94s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=740.94s)]
*  Anyone who tries to disarm you by definition considers you an enemy. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=741.94s)]
*  That's what you do to your enemies. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=747.74s)]
*  You disarm them. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=749.2600000000001s)]
*  Your friends, your allies, your children, people you love, why would you want to prevent them [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=751.0200000000001s)]
*  from defending themselves? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=754.46s)]
*  You never would. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=755.5s)]
*  You certainly wouldn't scream at them from the podium about how they're killing children [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=756.98s)]
*  if they want to protect their own families. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=760.3s)]
*  That's what you do to your enemies. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=761.9s)]
*  And yet somehow, a lot of Republicans, particularly in leadership, Mitch McConnell specifically, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=764.54s)]
*  but a lot of others, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, don't seem to understand this, or [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipp360lIfO0&t=769.1s)]
