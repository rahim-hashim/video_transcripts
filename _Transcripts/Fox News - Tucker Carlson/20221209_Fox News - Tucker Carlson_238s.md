# 'Libs of TikTok' creator speaks to Tucker on being blacklisted by Twitter
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew)
*  So as I told you, one of the accounts on Twitter that we just learned was shadowbanned very aggressively [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=0.0s)]
*  was an account called Libs of TikTok. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Now there's a reason they censored it because it's one of the most important accounts on Twitter. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=8.16s)]
*  There are very few opinions expressed on this Twitter feed. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  It is almost entirely video, real video, no one disputes that it's real, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=16.56s)]
*  showing what is happening inside classrooms where your children are being taught, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=21.6s)]
*  hospitals where your loved ones are being treated all over the country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=25.6s)]
*  So Twitter, on the basis of what justification? None. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=29.44s)]
*  Prevented Libs of TikTok from trending. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=33.36s)]
*  That means many people never saw what Libs of TikTok posted. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=36.56s)]
*  According to Barry Weiss, an internal Twitter memo from October of 2022, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=41.68s)]
*  after Libs of TikTok's seventh suspension, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=45.28s)]
*  admitted that the account, Libs of TikTok, was not breaking any rule. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=47.92s)]
*  The memo said this, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=52.24s)]
*  acknowledged that Libs of TikTok is not directly engaged in behavior [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  violative of hateful conduct policy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  So they didn't actually do anything wrong. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  But Twitter censors kept censoring and shadowbanning the account, Libs of TikTok, anyway, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=63.36s)]
*  because according to the memo, Libs of TikTok, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  specifically against hospitals that are castrating children. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=76.4s)]
*  Now that memo was prepared by Twitter's senior leadership, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  including its CEO and head of legal vajayagade. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=81.92s)]
*  The person who runs Libs of TikTok joins us now by phone. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=85.04s)]
*  I sure appreciate your coming on. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=89.84s)]
*  So you must have had some sense that you were being, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=91.36s)]
*  well, you were suspended multiple times, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=95.52s)]
*  but that you were being censored in ways they weren't telling you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=96.8s)]
*  Did you, did you sense this was happening? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=100.4s)]
*  Hi, Tucker. Great to be back. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=103.68s)]
*  Yes, I absolutely sensed that I was being censored. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=106.64s)]
*  I have a very large account. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=110.32s)]
*  I never was able to trend. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=114.24s)]
*  And now we find out I was on the trend blacklist. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  There were sometimes days or weeks at a time where I felt like my tweets were getting [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=118.8s)]
*  much less engagement than usual than they should. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  And I think now it's clear that there was suppression and there was shadowbanning. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=128.64s)]
*  What's so infuriating about this specific example is that you were reporting. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=136.4s)]
*  I mean, you weren't, and our viewers can verify this for themselves. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=144.32s)]
*  They just go onto your account. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=147.6s)]
*  You're not actually putting a lot of your own views in here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=149.44s)]
*  You're disseminating reported material whose authenticity no one doubts. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=152.8s)]
*  So you're doing what the New York Times claims it does, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=159.68s)]
*  but you're actually doing it unlike them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  What could possibly be the justification for censoring you? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=164.32s)]
*  Well, I think it's clear that their views when spread, they don't send up to scrutiny. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  And when I spread their views in their own words, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=177.12s)]
*  they don't want you to see it because they don't send up the scrutiny. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=181.68s)]
*  And it makes them look bad. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=185.68s)]
*  And that's what they're really scared of. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=187.28s)]
*  And the craziest part of this whole thing is that they admitted [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=189.84s)]
*  that I'm not even violating the policies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=195.04s)]
*  And they still suspended me seven times, three of which were for a week at a time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=197.6s)]
*  So I was suspended for probably a month altogether. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=203.28s)]
*  And for what? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  For not even violating their policies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=209.68s)]
*  Just because they don't like their own views. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=211.76s)]
*  They don't want you to see it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=214.64s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=216.16s)]
*  They were hiding. You expose them. They crush you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=217.12s)]
*  And we should say this is not a hobby. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=219.68s)]
*  I mean, you've devoted your life to this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=220.96s)]
*  We're glad that you have. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  We will talk to you soon. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=224.08s)]
*  Libs of TikTok. Good to see you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9X0Fhg-Ew&t=225.6s)]
