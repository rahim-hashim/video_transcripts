# Tucker: You're not allowed to point out this is insane
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Tonight, happy Friday. Since nobody reads [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=0.0s)]
*  books anymore, all of us get all of our history from Wikipedia. It's convenient. The problem [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=7.28s)]
*  is Wikipedia is so politicized and dishonest that on a lot of topics, certainly anything [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=11.96s)]
*  related to partisan politics, it's not even really worth reading anymore. There's just [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=16.84s)]
*  too much lying. On the other hand, there's a lot of stuff there. It's a huge site and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=21.04s)]
*  There are some gems remaining on Wikipedia. So if you have a minute this weekend, take [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=25.86s)]
*  a look at the entry on mass hysteria through the ages before the authorities inevitably [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=31.46s)]
*  delete it, as I'm certain they will. And as you read the entry, ask yourself if any of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=36.22s)]
*  this sounds familiar to you. There are lots of witch trials, of course, many of them, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=41.26s)]
*  many, many, many of them over many centuries. There are plagues of spontaneous dancing, mass [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=46.46s)]
*  ghost sightings, fits of laughing and trembling and babbling that seized entire towns at once [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=52.22s)]
*  for no apparent reason. It's all there. And then there are more esoteric outbreaks of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=58.1s)]
*  mass hysteria. There's a medieval French nun who, according to the entry, quote, inexplicably [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=64.02s)]
*  began to meow like a cat, leading the other nuns in the convent to meow as well. Eventually, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=69.92s)]
*  all of the nuns in the convent began meowing together, leaving the surrounding community [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=76.18s)]
*  astonished. This did not stop until the police threatened to whip the nuns. It's hilarious, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=81.1s)]
*  as you read it, though at the time the nuns definitely did not see the humor in it. They [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=88.22s)]
*  sincerely thought they were cats. Hysteria is like that. When large groups of people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=91.94s)]
*  start acting totally crazy, the reference points disappear. It all seems normal, no [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=97.7s)]
*  matter how nuts it is. So with that feature of human nature, which never changes, with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=103.46s)]
*  that in mind, take a look at this tape from yesterday's hearing before the House Oversight [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=109.62s)]
*  Committee. The topic was legal abortion, but because it is the year 2021 and we're all [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=114.06s)]
*  convinced we're cats, the conversation soon turned to the newly established scientific [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=119.54s)]
*  fact that men can get pregnant. Watch this. And I just wanted to acknowledge a lot of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  people are being left out of this conversation today because as we know, people get pregnant [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=130.26s)]
*  and not just women, but I hear people over and over and over again say women get pregnant, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=134.86s)]
*  but that's excluding people that should be a part of this conversation. Yeah, you don't [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=140.06s)]
*  want to exclude anyone. And it turns out that even in 2021, there are people out there who [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  are still claiming that only women get pregnant and they'd better stop claiming that or else. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  Amanda Presto just learned this. Presto was a writer at the Daily Wire and by the way, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=156.78000000000003s)]
*  so she tweeted this thought crime, assuming that she had biology on her side. She wrote this, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=162.22s)]
*  No, Amanda, you stop demeaning pregnant men. For her attack on the pregnant man community, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=175.17999999999998s)]
*  Twitter shut Amanda Presto down. We are cats and that's all there is to it. And that's true across [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=182.22s)]
*  the ocean in Great Britain. The head of the Labour Party in the UK has now declared that men too [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=188.7s)]
*  can have cervixes because of course they can. Meow. A few days later, a senior member of the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=192.94s)]
*  Labour Party was asked whether she agreed that men can have cervixes. She was asked on television. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=198.14s)]
*  Watch this uncomfortable moment. Is it transphobic to say only women have a cervix? Good morning. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=203.17999999999998s)]
*  Good morning, Nick. And it's great to talk to you. I just think that this issue has just become so [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=210.06s)]
*  divisive and toxic and it pits people against each other, both groups who face discrimination [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=217.34s)]
*  in society, women and trans women. And I just find this debate incredibly unhelpful and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=223.5s)]
*  unproductive to be totally honest. Is it transphobic, yes or no? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=230.62s)]
*  Is it transphobic? Look, I just I don't even know how to start answering these questions. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=239.02s)]
*  Come on, Rachel Reeves, shadow commissioner, whatever you are, the Labour Party. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=247.74s)]
*  It's a simple question. It's not a debate. Do men have cervixes? But she can't bring herself to say [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=254.46s)]
*  it. On the other hand, she doesn't dare note the obvious, which is that the entire conversation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=259.74s)]
*  is completely insane. So she breathes heavily, she rumps quite a bit and tries to move on to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=264.14s)]
*  the next topic. The Washington Post is hoping to avoid moments of uncertainty like this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=269.98s)]
*  So Jeff Bezos' newspaper has just issued a new style guidance to all of its reporters. Here's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=276.46s)]
*  what it says, quote, if we say pregnant women, we exclude those who are transgender and non-binary, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=281.26s)]
*  which of course is not defined. So no more pregnant women in the Washington Post. That's an [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=287.73999999999995s)]
*  outdated, inherently offensive category like secretaries and housewives. And this is true in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  hospitals too across the country. Some physicians are now punishing subordinates who recognize [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=299.97999999999996s)]
*  biological differences between men and women. Dr. Laura Chong, for example, a pediatric trainee at [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=304.86s)]
*  the Sydney Children's Hospital's network, recently told the New York Times that health care workers [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  should not use terms like ovaries and uterus. Quote, you can just say reproductive organs, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=317.26s)]
*  Chong said, and that's an order. The problem is that it may actually be medically relevant [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=323.82s)]
*  whether somebody has ovaries and a uterus. Reproductive organs might not be specific enough. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=331.66s)]
*  But honestly, in 2021, when we're all cats, who cares? Curing disease may be important, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  but is it more important than not offending the human rights campaign? Probably not. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=345.42s)]
*  That's a conclusion the CDC has reached. The center just released a graphic pointing out that, quote, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=350.38s)]
*  Only 31% of pregnant people have been vaccinated. Not pregnant women, pregnant people. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  And then there's The Lancet, which not that long ago was considered a serious medical journal. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=363.02s)]
*  The Lancet just released a cover with this headline, quote, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=367.18s)]
*  So that's the term. You thought you were a woman, now you're a, according to The Lancet, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=376.38s)]
*  a body with a vagina. Try to imagine a more dehumanizing phrase than that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=381.26s)]
*  It's probably not possible to imagine it, actually. At yesterday's House oversight hearing, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=386.14s)]
*  Gloria Steinem showed up to prove that she's still alive and still relevant somehow. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  For 50 years, Steinem has been, as she describes it, defending women. In the 70s, she wrote a piece [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=395.98s)]
*  for Cosmopolitan magazine entitled, If Men Could Menstruate. And then she was constantly reminding [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=401.26s)]
*  us, and this is a quote, if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=406.94s)]
*  Oh, but now men can get pregnant. So the script has changed a little bit. Here was Gloria Steinem, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=412.38s)]
*  who we should note is now a cat, meowing, telling us that absolutely anybody can get pregnant and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=418.38s)]
*  therefore anyone can get an abortion. Watch. What's happening in Texas is not only a local [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=424.54s)]
*  issue or a women's issue, it's a step against democracy, which allows us to control our own [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=430.22s)]
*  bodies and our own voices. Remember when Hitler was elected and he was elected, his very first [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=438.54s)]
*  official act was to padlock the family planning clinics and declare abortion a crime against the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=447.5s)]
*  state. Mussolini did exactly the same thing because they knew that controlling reproduction [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=455.66s)]
*  and nationalizing women's bodies is the first step in a controlling state, an all-controlling state. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=465.02000000000004s)]
*  It turns out Gloria Steinem was always pretty dumb, but back when she was 35, nobody noticed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=474.94000000000005s)]
*  But rewriting history? Can't let you do that. Sorry, you're not Wikipedia. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=480.06s)]
*  Actually, Adolf Hitler was an enthusiastic eugenicist, just like Margaret Sanger, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=484.62s)]
*  who founded Planned Parenthood. He encouraged abortion according to almost everyone who studied [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=488.3s)]
*  this. Jeffrey Tumela, for example, a law professor who has written a lot about the Nuremberg trials. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=495.09999999999997s)]
*  Hitler, like Gloria Steinem, supported abortion, not just as a matter of physical autonomy, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=499.82s)]
*  but as a way to keep women working and contributing to the economy. Quote, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=506.38s)]
*  The Nazis preferred that the Eastern European workers not become pregnant so they would not be [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=511.34s)]
*  taken out of the workforce. They took measures to identify pregnant workers and to encourage or [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=515.26s)]
*  pressure them into making use of the abortion services the Nazis provided. Oh, does that sound [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=519.98s)]
*  familiar? So once again, the goal is to reduce women to wage slaves. It is more virtuous to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=525.58s)]
*  work at JP Morgan than it is to be a mother. That's what they're telling you. That's what [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=533.66s)]
*  Ayanna Pressley is telling you. She complained that abortion bans are tools of, you guessed it, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=538.7s)]
*  white supremacy. And the experts at the hearings yesterday agreed. Watch. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=544.7s)]
*  I think that it's very important for us to understand the intersection of racial justice [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=549.6600000000001s)]
*  policies and gender justice policies and reproductive justice policies, because you [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=556.5400000000001s)]
*  don't understand why these bans on abortion are not about having more black and brown babies born. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=563.26s)]
*  They want more white babies to be born. We're falling for it again. Rising to the bait, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=571.26s)]
*  being literal, correcting insanity, because, you know, it's kind of hard to resist. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=578.86s)]
*  There is no rational conversation about anything currently underway in the United States. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=585.66s)]
*  We have to say, just again, in the interest of fact checking, that what you just heard is the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=592.38s)]
*  opposite of the truth. New York City is the biggest city in America. It's got eight million people. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=596.78s)]
*  The abortion rate in New York among African-American mothers is roughly three times the rate that it is [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  for white mothers. Thousands more black babies are born in New York that are born every year. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=607.8199999999999s)]
*  So shutting down the abortion clinics in New York, which no one's even proposing, but if you were to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=614.38s)]
*  do that, you would have a lot more black babies than you have now. We can't even get to that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=619.18s)]
*  conversation because we can no longer agree that only women have babies. Now, men have babies. So [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=626.06s)]
*  for 50 years they told us men have no interest in whether or not abortion is legal because they [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=634.14s)]
*  can't have kids, but now they can. So we thought it would be worth weighing in on this. According [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=639.26s)]
*  to the House Oversight Committee, it is all for your own good. Watch. I know firsthand that abortion [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=645.66s)]
*  saves lives. For the thousands of people I've cared for, abortion is a blessing. Abortion is [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGT4nhS1uE&t=652.38s)]
