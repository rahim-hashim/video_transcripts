# Tucker: Whatâ€™s going on with BLM? #shorts
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA)
*  So the gun control activist promoted by Julia Reed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=0.0s)]
*  pulls a gun out and starts shooting at people. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=3.36s)]
*  Turns out the people who are accusing you of violence [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=6.2s)]
*  are actually committing quite a bit of violence [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=8.64s)]
*  in this country, have you noticed? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=10.1s)]
*  A few months ago, a black nationalist racist BLM supporter [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=11.76s)]
*  murdered a number of people by driving over them [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=15.0s)]
*  with his SUV in Wisconsin. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=17.64s)]
*  That was mass murder, don't hear that story much. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=20.0s)]
*  Episodes like that focus some attention [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=22.68s)]
*  on who exactly is donating to BLM [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  and who the organization recruits and is run by. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=27.02s)]
*  The Washington Examiner looked into this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  and it turns out that for several months now, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  nobody appears to have been in charge of BLM [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  or the tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=36.86s)]
*  it has raised. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=39.92s)]
*  Huh? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=41.4s)]
*  What's happened to all the money that Google sent them? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Jeff Bezos, well, the address that BLM lists [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=45.2s)]
*  on his tax forms is wrong. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=47.64s)]
*  And the charities to board members won't say [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=50.16s)]
*  who control the at least $60 million they've got in the bank. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUhItVBudA&t=52.7s)]
