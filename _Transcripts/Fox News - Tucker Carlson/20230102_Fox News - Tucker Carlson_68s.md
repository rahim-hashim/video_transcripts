# Tucker Carlson: This isn't the whole story
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI)
*  Good evening and welcome to a special and unusual edition of Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, a happy edition. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=6.2s)]
*  It's the new year. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=8.0s)]
*  As the new year begins, 2023, with everything that's going on in the world, it is easy to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=9.82s)]
*  feel, well, a sense of impending doom. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  You could spend five minutes watching TV or browsing social media, and you would come [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=18.0s)]
*  up with a million reasons why this country is done. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=21.96s)]
*  So despair is more tempting than ever. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=24.94s)]
*  But it's not the whole story. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=29.34s)]
*  And because it's not, we're taking the next hour to show you the other side. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=30.78s)]
*  Yes, this country has problems. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=34.86s)]
*  We wouldn't have a very interesting TV show if it didn't. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=36.14s)]
*  But the truth is that this country also has an awful lot going for it, more than any other [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  country in the world. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Great people, deep natural beauty, and a culture-wide love of animals, which matters. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=44.54s)]
*  So even where there is tremendous suffering, all of that shines through. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=52.3s)]
*  That's the gift. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=56.7s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=57.82s)]
*  changing the world and changing your life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=62.940000000000005s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_k8ZwAOWqI&t=65.46000000000001s)]
