# VDH: Pete Buttigieg is 'afraid' to confront East Palestine residents
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY)
*  Victor Davis Hansen is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution joins us tonight to assess professor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming on wouldn't it be nice to see somebody [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=4.64s)]
*  pay some price for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=8.48s)]
*  ineptitude and indifference [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=11.4s)]
*  Yeah, what he's he's jumped the proverbial shark though, he's the epitome of the empty resume class [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=14.5s)]
*  I mean his only qualifications for the job [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=20.66s)]
*  Were his identity politics credentials in the fact he went to Harvard and Oxford and the media and the bicolso elite gaga [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=23.3s)]
*  Overed him, but otherwise Tucker he had the unmitigated touch everything. He's touched whether it was the port [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=31.1s)]
*  crowding at our major ports or the train robbing of trains going into the ports or these recent four accidents were [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=38.14s)]
*  Airliners almost crashed or the southwest implosion or the whole meltdown during the holiday season of our airline [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=45.94s)]
*  System or these railcar everything he either ignores or he offers these [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=53.26s)]
*  Platitudes and how ironic that right on the eve or right in the midst [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=58.739999999999995s)]
*  I should say of this tragedy in East Palestine of this white working-class tiny community with income [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=63.26s)]
*  average income about [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=70.42s)]
*  $45,000 he was lecturing the nation [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=72.5s)]
*  That white hard hats don't look like the community they are working in and that's not true [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=75.3s)]
*  It's it's not only that is he pandering but he's often inaccurate and ignorant here in California most of the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=81.08s)]
*  construction workers you see on the the elite coast or Hispanic and most of the residents are [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=88.7s)]
*  White upper-class people that's just the way America works [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=93.66s)]
*  But he always tries to in lieu of actually doing something. He always tries to have a rhetorical or an abstract [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  Victory and I think people finally just feel you know, they're tired of him and he's afraid he's also he talks very bold and like [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=104.72s)]
*  He's bold and he's dynamic [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  but he's very cowardly because he's afraid to go in and confront these people and tell them why that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=113.72s)]
*  FEMA wasted two weeks before they address their concerns and why he hasn't been there and I we know the reason is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=119.96s)]
*  That he doesn't want to sit there and talk to people when they ask him questions. He can't answer and so [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=127.12s)]
*  He's just sort of what this whole entire cabinet is that this cabinet was either predicated on being an identity politics [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=133.32s)]
*  First in their field so to speak or they were candidates that pulled out and gave the nomination to Joe Biden [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=140.4s)]
*  But otherwise none of them had any demonstrable [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=146.84s)]
*  Experience or expertise in the field that they were supposed to serve us the people. That's right [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  It's just a little bit funny [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=155.96s)]
*  They've been lecturing us now for two years about something called environmental racism [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=157.24s)]
*  And then there's an actual environmental disaster in the midst of a community of people who didn't vote for them and they ignore it [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=160.72s)]
*  That actually does look like environmental racism to me [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=167.12s)]
*  It is and the reason is is that East Palestine is right on the border of Pennsylvania and it's in clinger [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=170.68s)]
*  It's the very area that in 2008 [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=178.12s)]
*  Barack Obama blasted as they cling to their religion and then we know how Joe Biden is called Trump supporters [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=181.44s)]
*  Chumps and dregs and we know the irredeemables and deplorable vocabulary of Hillary Clinton [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=189.06s)]
*  So they have a long record of disparagement of the white working class [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  I don't know why they think they can just get away with it so easily without some kind of reaction [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=198.52s)]
*  But they are it is racist and if this was in Malibu or this was in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=204.0s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard or even in Compton or South Central [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  There would be an immediate US government response by this administration [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  Right among the rich or the fashionable poor, but these people fall through the cracks every single time [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=218.12s)]
*  Vick Davis Hanson joining us tonight. Thank you so much [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJttkY5S6GY&t=226.84s)]
