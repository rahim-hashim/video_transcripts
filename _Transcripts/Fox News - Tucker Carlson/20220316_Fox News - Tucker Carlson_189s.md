# Tucker: Things are changing very fast
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=2.7s)]
*  addressed members of Congress today [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  in a long and at times moving speech. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=8.2s)]
*  Among other things, Zelensky demanded [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=11.82s)]
*  the United States shoot down Russian aircraft [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=14.18s)]
*  over his country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=16.22s)]
*  The White House has not yet agreed to do that, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  but things do seem to be moving very rapidly [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=19.56s)]
*  in that direction. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=21.66s)]
*  Not long after Zelensky's address, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=22.82s)]
*  Joe Biden announced the United States will send a total [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=25.02s)]
*  of at least a billion dollars of weapons to Ukraine [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=27.22s)]
*  just this week. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=30.32s)]
*  Members of Congress in both parties then emerged [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  to say they don't think that's enough. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=34.56s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=36.46s)]
*  And the lethal drones, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=37.82s)]
*  we need more of those in country as well. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=39.42s)]
*  People talk about a no-fly zone, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=41.96s)]
*  they can create their own if we give them [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=43.44s)]
*  the military equipment and weapons. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=45.2s)]
*  But there's a lot I think we can do [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=47.9s)]
*  to help Ukraine shoot down those Russian aircraft, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  bring down those missiles. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=53.0s)]
*  We need to send a package that includes fighter jets [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=54.24s)]
*  and air defense systems to the Ukraine immediately [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=57.2s)]
*  so that we can have a Ukrainian no-fly zone. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=61.2s)]
*  What we need to do is make sure that Ukraine [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=64.62s)]
*  has the equipment it needs in order to defend itself, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=66.68s)]
*  particularly the skies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=71.28s)]
*  I think there's a bipartisan movement right here, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=73.22s)]
*  provide them the mix, provide them the planes [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=75.76s)]
*  where they can create a no-fly zone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  So things are changing very fast. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=82.16s)]
*  For weeks, leaders in Washington told us [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  that an American-backed no-fly zone in Ukraine [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=85.32s)]
*  would be unwise because it would amount to an act of war [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=88.02s)]
*  against a nuclear-armed Russia. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  As you can see, those views have evolved a lot. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=92.96s)]
*  But in fairness, Congresswoman Maria Salazar [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  got there first. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=99.1s)]
*  Salazar is a longtime news anchor from Miami [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=100.44s)]
*  who a little over a year ago was elected to Congress [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=102.5s)]
*  as a Republican. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=104.6s)]
*  She now sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=105.8s)]
*  A week ago, a reporter from the Gray Zone asked Salazar [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=107.74s)]
*  what she thought of a no-fly zone. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=110.44s)]
*  Here's what she said. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=112.34s)]
*  Do you support a no-fly zone in Ukraine? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=113.88s)]
*  I support everything that has to do with punishing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Putin and helping the Ukrainians. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't that mean direct conventional warfare with Russia? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=122.66s)]
*  I don't know what it will mean, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=125.32s)]
*  but you know freedom is not free. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=126.3s)]
*  So you don't know what a no-fly zone will mean? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=128.0s)]
*  If you do, you have to shoot down Russian planes, I mean. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=130.16s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=132.76s)]
*  I don't know what it will mean, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=135.74s)]
*  but you know freedom is not free. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=136.9s)]
*  Now, we made fun of that answer last week [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=138.04s)]
*  when we first showed you that clip. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=139.88s)]
*  But now what we mocked is the consensus in Washington. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=142.06s)]
*  We don't know what's gonna happen. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=145.06s)]
*  We've gotta do it immediately. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=146.0s)]
*  That's the argument you're hearing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=147.16s)]
*  At this point, no one wants to say it out loud, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=149.06s)]
*  but it is true, at this point, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=151.1s)]
*  a shooting war with Russia seems inevitable. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=152.64s)]
*  How could war with Russia not be inevitable? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  Virtually everyone with power is for it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=158.5s)]
*  We remain against it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  We think that joining a war in Eastern Europe [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=162.78s)]
*  will hurt this country, though to be clear, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=164.44s)]
*  when and if that war starts, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  we will be praying passionately for America's total victory. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=168.74s)]
*  Unlike so many in the foreign policy establishment, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=172.84s)]
*  we love this country above all, and we mean it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRxP-CQuKQs&t=174.64s)]
