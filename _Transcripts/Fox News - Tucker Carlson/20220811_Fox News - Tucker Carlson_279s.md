# Scott Perry on FBI cell phone seizure
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk)
*  Scott Perry, the aforementioned congressman from Pennsylvania, joins us right now for his first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=0.0s)]
*  exclusive interview since the FBI confiscated his phone. Congressman, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=4.4s)]
*  Can you bring us through what happened? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=9.92s)]
*  Brian, you're absolutely right. I got a knock on the door in the morning. I went to the door. There [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=14.08s)]
*  are three FBI agents. Of course, like you said, I'm traveling with my family. We have two young [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=19.44s)]
*  daughters. I'm with my elderly in-laws. They want to take my cell phone. I said, could you [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=25.04s)]
*  contact my attorney? Why does this have to happen out on the street? And how did you find me, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=33.84s)]
*  by the way? Of course, they wouldn't answer that question. They said they were going to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=40.8s)]
*  image the cell phone and return it sometime later since I didn't have a phone. This is my [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=44.4s)]
*  personal cell phone, Brian. I have an official cell phone. They don't want that. So this is my [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=48.96s)]
*  personal cell phone that I talk to my wife on, that I talk to my children on, my constituents. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=55.92s)]
*  None of the government's business. And of course, immediately the story blows up. I'm sure you know. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=60.4s)]
*  What's interesting, though, is while that story blew up, I heard from my attorneys who talked [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=66.88s)]
*  directly to the Department of Justice who said that I, their client, am not a target of this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=71.6s)]
*  investigation. Now think about that. If I'm not a target, why do they come follow me, find me on [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=77.36s)]
*  when I'm traveling with my family? They don't come to my house. They don't contact my attorney. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=83.68s)]
*  Why do they come and seize my cell phone to image it in that fashion? If they would have just [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=88.56s)]
*  contacted my attorney, certainly we would have provided the information necessary as required [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=94.08s)]
*  by law. And that would have been the end of it. But they want this spectacle. They want this show. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=98.88s)]
*  They want the intimidation. And of course, the media is not saying anything about the fact that, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=102.88s)]
*  you know, reported today that I am not a target of this investigation. And so look, this is the DOJ [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  run amok. And I think what people need to really think about is in about a day, we're going to vote [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=116.32s)]
*  on a package and it'll probably pass where they're going to employ 87,000 new IRS agents. What do you [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=120.88s)]
*  think they're going to be doing? They're going to be coming for all of you, you know. So yesterday [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=127.28s)]
*  it was my cell phone. Tomorrow it's going to be average hardworking Americans that are just [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=131.6s)]
*  trying to make it through their days. When did they confront you? What day? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=136.72s)]
*  Yesterday. Yesterday was Tuesday morning. Now the president's house was raided Monday. Do you think [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=142.4s)]
*  they're linked? Right. I do think all of this is linked. Of course it is. And what do you think [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=147.84s)]
*  they're looking for? Look, I don't know. Like I said, we asked, I'm not a target of the investigation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=155.28s)]
*  So I can't really speculate. I don't know what they're looking for, but they came and took my [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=162.96s)]
*  cell phone even though I'm not a target, which is, you think about that. This is what I'm getting at. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=168.56s)]
*  Congresswoman, this is what I'm getting at. The National, the FBI said, although the Trump family [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=174.16s)]
*  has not seen the warrant yet, the FBI said we're here for the, on behalf of the National Archives. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=179.36s)]
*  Okay. So the National Archives, or is this about January 6th? What do you think? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=186.08s)]
*  Boy, here's what I think. I think that they're scared to death that President Donald Trump is [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=193.84s)]
*  going to come back in 2024 and win reelection. And they're going to do every single thing that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=199.04s)]
*  they can to make sure that doesn't happen, including make up some kind of charges from [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=203.84s)]
*  the National Archives. I mean, quite honestly, it's absurd if it's the National Archives. I mean, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=208.96s)]
*  the president is the ultimate classification authority. You're saying he took classified [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=214.24s)]
*  information out, you know, he's the classifier. James Comey leaked classified information to get [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=218.88s)]
*  a special counsel. Hillary Clinton, we don't know the extent of the classified information [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=224.88s)]
*  she had on her private server. No accountability whatsoever. But somehow, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=230.24s)]
*  do they think that President Trump packed the boxes at the White House to take tomorrow? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=235.12s)]
*  I think this is all about 2024 and their disdain for President Trump and the fact that they know [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=240.8s)]
*  he's coming back and likely to beat their candidate Joe Biden or any other candidate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=246.88s)]
*  Did you get your phone back? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=250.8s)]
*  Did you get your phone back? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=255.12s)]
*  Congressman, did you get your phone back? I guess we might have lost him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=256.16s)]
*  All right, Congressman Scott Perry, thanks. We'll watch you play this back and you'll see I did [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=259.68s)]
*  thank you. I wasn't rude. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLD0tQ7IBhk&t=263.68s)]
