# Tucker: Democrats think our democracy is this fragile
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, happy Wednesday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=2.96s)]
*  Parenthood is awesome, but you learn a lot. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=4.64s)]
*  If you ever had kids in middle school, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=6.32s)]
*  you know what sustained emotional drama looks like. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=8.24s)]
*  Everything's fairly placid up until about seventh grade, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=12.16s)]
*  and then the four horsemen of the adolescent apocalypse [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  arrive, hormones, homework, dating, and acting, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=18.0s)]
*  and things get very volatile, very fast. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  The main symptom of this period of childhood development, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  apart from door slamming, is wild overstatement. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=27.52s)]
*  No longer is anything okay or not very good. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=31.36s)]
*  No, even the mildest inconvenience is transformed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=34.8s)]
*  into a horrifying world ending disaster. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=38.8s)]
*  The Titanic meets Vesuvius plus Y2K. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=41.8s)]
*  Four minutes late for school [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=45.32s)]
*  is the single worst day of my life ever. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Waking up before nine is like death. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  A pop quiz in math class? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=51.9s)]
*  That's the emotional equivalent of ethnic cleansing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  in Bosnia, except much more upsetting. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=56.84s)]
*  It's pretty intense. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  Thankfully, most kids get over middle school. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=61.0s)]
*  Those who don't tend to leave home and not come back. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=63.32000000000001s)]
*  They become interpretive dance majors [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=65.92s)]
*  at small liberal arts colleges, or they run for Congress. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Ever wonder why America's traditional party [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=71.68s)]
*  of the unionized working man suddenly sounds like a van [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=74.44s)]
*  full of eighth grade girls on the way to prom, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=77.7s)]
*  all breathy and on the verge of tears? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=79.68s)]
*  Well, it's simple, because at this point, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=82.44s)]
*  that's pretty much exactly what the Democratic Party is. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=84.2s)]
*  You really notice it in the way they speak. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=87.4s)]
*  For Democrats, there are no more small problems. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=90.36s)]
*  No challenges, minor. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=93.16s)]
*  Every speed bump is a full-blown catastrophe. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=95.36s)]
*  Every disagreement, total war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=98.5s)]
*  Losing an election? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=100.92s)]
*  They can't even talk about it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=102.12s)]
*  Close your eyes and try to picture [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=104.12s)]
*  the scariest threat you can imagine. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  The prowler at the door. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=108.28s)]
*  The monster under the bed. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=109.84s)]
*  An IRS audit. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  Now, multiply that scene by a million [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=113.48s)]
*  sweat-covered nightmares, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=115.92s)]
*  and you are just beginning to approach the level of terror [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  the Democrats feel when they think about giving up power. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=121.12s)]
*  It's not just a bad outcome. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=124.28s)]
*  It's the end of democracy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=126.28s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=130.0s)]
*  Is the end of our democracy in sight? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=132.04s)]
*  And I believe that the election of Joe Biden [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=134.72s)]
*  essentially paused our dissent [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  into just the complete upending of our democracy, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=141.28s)]
*  but we are not out of it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=144.28s)]
*  Some Donald Trump's comeback. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  It's the end of our democracy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=147.12s)]
*  We might see the end of democracy in the coming years. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=149.24s)]
*  So you're saying it's still possible [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=152.72s)]
*  we could lose our democracy here in the United States? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=155.12s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=158.24s)]
*  If Americans lose faith in the veracity [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=159.24s)]
*  and honor of our elections, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  it's the beginning of end of our democracy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=164.12s)]
*  I think that could be the end of our democracy, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  not to be too, you know, pointed about it, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  but I want people to understand. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=170.92s)]
*  Hillary Clinton said a couple of weeks ago [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=172.72s)]
*  that if he runs and wins, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=174.16s)]
*  that could be the end of our democracy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=175.16s)]
*  Do you share that fear? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, I don't want to be overly alarmist, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=179.6s)]
*  but I think we should be alarmed, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=181.48s)]
*  because potentially this could be the end [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=182.72s)]
*  of American democracy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=184.92s)]
*  I never thought I'd be saying something like that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=186.32s)]
*  It could be the end of American democracy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  I never thought I'd be saying something like that, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=190.72s)]
*  says Max Booth. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=192.88s)]
*  Well, that makes two of us. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=194.16s)]
*  We always knew that Max Booth loved to kill brown people [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=195.6s)]
*  in impoverished villages in faraway countries, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  and we wanted to send other people's kids [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=200.12s)]
*  to do it for him. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=201.6s)]
*  But we had no idea that Max Booth was in the middle [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=202.84s)]
*  of a full-blown emotional breakdown. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=205.8s)]
*  He must be, because how else do you explain [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=208.0s)]
*  a reaction like that? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=210.6s)]
*  For a well-adjusted normal person, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=212.84s)]
*  unwanted election outcomes are part of life. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=214.96s)]
*  Voters don't always do what you want them to do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=218.52s)]
*  It is frustrating, but that's how it works. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=221.68s)]
*  In fact, when voters reject you, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=224.4s)]
*  you get a chance to assess your own behavior. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=225.84s)]
*  Chances are there is a reason [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=228.8s)]
*  that people didn't want you in power, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=230.52s)]
*  and you now have time to think about [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=232.36s)]
*  what that reason might be. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  That's a healthy process. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=236.0s)]
*  So when you lose, it is hardly proof [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=238.24s)]
*  that the system is broken. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=240.4s)]
*  In fact, it's usually evidence [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  that things are working exactly as intended. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  But people like Max Booth and Liz Cheney [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=247.44s)]
*  do not see it that way. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  They are too fragile to face their own unpopularity. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=251.4s)]
*  To people like that, the prospect of rejection [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  by voters, of losing control of the country, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=258.0s)]
*  means literally, literally, literally [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=260.64s)]
*  the end of democracy itself. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=263.68s)]
*  Imagine feeling that way. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=267.48s)]
*  If you really believe that your election loss [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=269.76s)]
*  meant the end of America [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=272.72s)]
*  and the beginning of a thousand years of darkness, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=274.28s)]
*  you might have trouble keeping perspective on politics. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=277.2s)]
*  Every election would feel like climate change, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=280.48s)]
*  the most profound existential crisis [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=283.2s)]
*  in the history of the world. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=285.32s)]
*  And if your side ever lost an election, whoa. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=286.56s)]
*  How do you describe a disaster [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=290.64s)]
*  that existentially existential? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  Honestly, words would fail you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=294.52s)]
*  You'd have only animal sounds. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=296.16s)]
*  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=298.56s)]
*  President Obama. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=301.32s)]
*  Oh! [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=302.16s)]
*  Oh! [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=303.0s)]
*  Oh! [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=303.84000000000003s)]

*  Mr. Trump is in a moment. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=305.52s)]
*  Step aside. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  And so do you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=307.68s)]
*  You're just gonna have to follow as you're told, man. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=309.32s)]
*  Introduced for the first time ever [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=311.96s)]

*  Yes, Democrats, someone you didn't vote for [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  won the presidential election. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, if you're not a Democrat, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=328.32s)]
*  it's pretty hard to imagine the pain of a moment like that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  For Democrats, it was like being boiled alive [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=333.28s)]
*  in a giant mug of the world's hottest latte, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  but without the soothing foam. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=338.12s)]
*  Four years of wrenching agony. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=340.24s)]
*  The whole experience hurt so much [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=343.52s)]
*  that Democrats inevitably came to the obvious conclusion. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=345.68s)]
*  Going forward, no voter, alive or dead, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=348.88s)]
*  citizen or illegal, should ever again be asked [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  to show voter ID at the polls. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=354.88s)]
*  It was a simple, elegant solution [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  that no sensible person could disagree with. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, not everyone is sensible. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=362.64s)]
*  Many people are like Hitler, so they oppose voter fraud. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=364.44s)]
*  Democrats wasted no time [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=368.2s)]
*  in becoming hysterical about this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=369.76s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=371.56s)]
*  Tonight's lead, Jim Crow 2.0. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  It is the most pernicious thing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=377.36s)]
*  This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=379.56s)]
*  Our remnants of Jim Crow, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  I shouldn't even say remnants, revivals, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=386.0s)]
*  an attempted revival at Jim Crow. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=388.16s)]
*  A Jim Crow KKK-like caucus. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  Their strategy right now [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  is to pass a bunch of racist voting laws, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=395.0s)]
*  effectively a new Jim Crow in the South, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  and allow Republicans all across the country [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=398.88s)]
*  to implement Jim Crow 2.0. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  Jim Crow 2.0, this is Jim, Jane Crow. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=403.32000000000005s)]
*  This is Sally and every other crow that we can imagine. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=406.88s)]
*  It's voter suppression. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  It's the new Jim Crow. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=414.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=418.16s)]
*  Showing photo ID to vote, says Mr. Eric Michael Dyson, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=419.12s)]
*  who not only teaches at a college, but has three names. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=423.72s)]
*  That is both Jim Crow and Jane Crow, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=427.16s)]
*  and for that matter, very much like their little-known [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=429.84s)]
*  love child, Josephus Crow, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  who's even more racist than his parents are. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=433.32s)]
*  That's how immoral voter ID is. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=435.84s)]
*  So stop it right now, says Eric Michael Dyson. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=437.56s)]
*  It's the end of democracy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=440.11999999999995s)]
*  At this point, a lot of things are the end of democracy, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  including, we are here to tell you, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  not wearing a mask in an elevator. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=445.76s)]
*  Yes, that's the end of democracy too, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=448.52s)]
*  so says the latest bulletin from, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=451.4s)]
*  and we wanna be clear here, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=453.08s)]
*  we're not accusing anyone of hysteria, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  just reporting the news, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=455.4s)]
*  from this sitting Democratic congresswoman, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=457.04s)]
*  who in point of fact rarely sits, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  but instead leaps around pointing her finger at people [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=461.44s)]
*  and accusing them of things. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=463.24s)]
*  In any case, here she is explaining [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  the latest threats of democracy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=466.36s)]
*  This has happened to me, where you get on an elevator [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  and people refuse to wear a mask, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  and your choices are to either get off the elevator, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=472.76000000000005s)]
*  or to get on the elevator, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  and to tell them to wear a mask. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=476.88s)]
*  That should not be a problem in the United States Congress, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  and I really believe that our colleagues [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=483.68s)]
*  who refuse to even adhere to the basic norms of civility [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=487.32s)]
*  are undermining our democracy, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=492.24s)]
*  and of course we're seeing it in all kinds of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=494.0s)]
*  even more serious ways, like the January 6th insurrection. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  So those are your choices with an insurrection, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=500.04s)]
*  this gets on the elevator without a map. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=502.0s)]
*  Of course, the other choice is to seek immediate [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=503.64s)]
*  psychiatric care and behave like an adult. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=505.12s)]
*  That has not occurred to them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=506.76s)]
*  Because democracy is at stake, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=508.52s)]
*  it turns out you can destroy our ancient democracy [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=509.68s)]
*  just by forgetting to wear your mask in an elevator. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=512.68s)]
*  Think about that for a moment, Mr. and Mrs. America. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=515.8s)]
*  Our democracy is that brittle. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=519.12s)]
*  One act of carelessness, and it could shatter [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=521.88s)]
*  into a million pieces like a priceless vase. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  It's enough to keep you up at night. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=528.3599999999999s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger has not slept since he realized that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=529.76s)]
*  The thought that some oaf might trip on a carpet edge [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=533.0s)]
*  and drop democracy onto a hardwood floor, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  literally, literally makes Adam Kinzinger cry. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=539.08s)]
*  That's how sensitive he is, watch. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=543.72s)]
*  I never expected a day to be quite as emotional for me [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=546.2800000000001s)]

*  We're defined by how we come back from bad days. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=566.52s)]
*  Yes, another seventh grade girl representing you in Congress, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=571.32s)]
*  ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Adam Kinzinger. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypN8G3_tb2o&t=574.28s)]
