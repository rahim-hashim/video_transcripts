# Tucker Carlson: This is an actual threat to democracy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight it's funny about profound change. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=5.2s)]
*  You always imagine when things change radically there are going to be troops in the streets [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=7.84s)]
*  and you're going to know this is the pivot point, this is the revolution. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  But that's most of the time not what actually happens. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=15.84s)]
*  Usually there's some guy in a suit and tie speaking soothing words. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  And you don't even know that everything is changing when it is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=22.32s)]
*  That's the case with what happened on June 15, 2012, a decade ago. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=27.16s)]
*  On that day Barack Obama walked into the Rose Garden and announced, full of self-confidence [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=32.12s)]
*  and coolness, Obama announced that his administration decided actually not to deport millions of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=37.0s)]
*  illegal immigrants. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=42.2s)]
*  Henceforth Barack Obama explained these millions of people would no longer be identified in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=43.96s)]
*  fact as illegal aliens or even breakers of federal law, which everyone had assumed they [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=48.54s)]
*  were. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=53.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=54.0s)]
*  They would be called dreamers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=55.0s)]
*  So illegal aliens are bad, of course, but dreamers are good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=57.4s)]
*  And because to control language is to control reality, these dreamers would no longer be [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  subject to federal law. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=67.64s)]
*  They'd be above federal law because you can't ban a dream. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  That's effectively the case that Obama made. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=73.28s)]
*  Now what Obama did that day was, strictly speaking, illegal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=75.72s)]
*  Several courts later ruled that it's illegal, obviously. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=79.76s)]
*  Only kings and legislatures get to change the law. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=82.8s)]
*  American presidents do not have that power and never have. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=86.32s)]
*  But no one stopped Barack Obama from doing this, so he did it anyway. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=89.88s)]
*  And the effect, the intended effect, was immediate. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=92.96s)]
*  Foreign nationals flooded into the United States. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=96.28s)]
*  Over the decade before Obama's Dreamer Rose Garden announcement, about 8,000 unaccompanied [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=99.72s)]
*  minors showed up at the U.S. border every year. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=105.16s)]
*  Obama redefined lawbreakers as dreamers, more than 24,000 showed up. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=108.36s)]
*  And that's accelerated. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=113.72s)]
*  Under Joe Biden, the number has grown to 130,000 per year. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=114.72s)]
*  Now it's interesting where these people are coming from. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=119.84s)]
*  They're not coming from a contiguous nation, Mexico. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=122.72s)]
*  No, they're coming from much farther away. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=125.92s)]
*  According to new numbers from HHS, 32% of unaccompanied migrants they're seeing are [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=128.96s)]
*  from Honduras, 47% are from Guatemala. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=133.28s)]
*  Look at a map. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=135.92s)]
*  13% are from El Salvador. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=137.0s)]
*  Those are far away. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=139.2s)]
*  Those are in Central America. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=140.32s)]
*  Just 1% are coming from Mexico. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  What's going on here exactly? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=144.88s)]
*  Well, mostly they are teenagers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  The overwhelming majority are over the age of 14. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  They're not little kids. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  And again, this is accelerating. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  And it didn't stop during the last administration. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration didn't stop it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  Under media pressure, that administration agreed to end so-called family separations [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=158.76s)]
*  at the border. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  Really, they're inhumane. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  But the fact is, family separations happen all the time to American citizens. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=165.58s)]
*  If you commit a crime, you're going to be separated from your kids and NBC News won't [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=169.66000000000003s)]
*  care at all, much less report it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=174.02s)]
*  But illegal aliens, dreamers, shouldn't be forced to face these consequences, explained [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=176.5s)]
*  the New York Times. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=181.5s)]
*  So now they're not faced to because they're dreamers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=182.5s)]
*  So naturally, the surge continued. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  But why? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=188.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=190.10000000000002s)]
*  Typically, a country calculates its immigration levels based on its internal needs. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=191.66s)]
*  So all throughout American history, there have been periods where, oh, we need people [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  to do this or that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=202.98s)]
*  Let's import those people. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=204.3s)]
*  But based on the state of the US economy in 2022, these are not the people you would import [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=206.66s)]
*  if you cared about your country. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=212.34s)]
*  Almost none of the arrivals have a meaningful education. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=213.8s)]
*  They're not trained to participate in the emerging economy you hear so much about. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=215.98s)]
*  Plays no role in this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=220.5s)]
*  There's no economic justification whatsoever for these levels of immigration. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  And of course, immigration destabilizes your society. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=226.86s)]
*  It makes it far less cohesive. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=230.56s)]
*  That's always true. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=232.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter where they're coming from. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=233.44s)]
*  If you have a ton of new people, you're less cohesive. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  So why are they coming? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's only one reason. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  Because the Democratic Party wants new voters. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=240.78s)]
*  Period. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=243.38s)]
*  That's not a racist conspiracy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=244.38s)]
*  It's not racist. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=246.38s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=247.38s)]
*  It's true. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=248.86s)]
*  And we know that it's true, not because we heard it on Alex Jones, but because leading [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=250.62s)]
*  Democrats have said so repeatedly in public for years. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  And here's the latest example. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=259.3s)]
*  Here is Chuck Schumer, the head Democrat in the US Senate, last month. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=260.42s)]
*  Now more than ever, we're short of workers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=264.8s)]
*  We have a population that is not reproducing it on its own with the same level that it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=268.76s)]
*  used to. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=274.54s)]
*  The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=275.8s)]
*  the Dreamers and all of them. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=280.64s)]
*  Because our ultimate goal is to help the Dreamers, but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  or however many undocumented there are here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=288.0s)]
*  Everything about that was a lie. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=293.04s)]
*  We need workers, really. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  There are what, seven million American born men who have dropped out of the workforce? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  Workforce age who just aren't working or on the internet all day? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=300.92s)]
*  Does anyone care? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=303.66s)]
*  Just replace them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  Americans aren't reproducing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=307.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=308.52s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=309.52s)]
*  Well, because the economy has changed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=310.52s)]
*  And what's their answer to that? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  The Democratic Party's answer? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, the Treasury Secretary told us a month and a half ago. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  She said if you run up the economy, have an abortion. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=317.08s)]
*  People who want to have kids increasingly can't. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=321.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=323.2s)]
*  Well, because the food supply in the air and water have been poisoned and sperm counts are [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=324.2s)]
*  half what they were a few decades ago. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=329.08s)]
*  So these are specific problems that have prevented millions of Americans from having [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=332.26s)]
*  families from reproducing, as Chuck Schumer just said. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=338.8s)]
*  And you could fix them if you tried, but they're not trying. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=342.2s)]
*  Instead, the solution is to replace the people who aren't reproducing with millions of new [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=345.62s)]
*  people from other countries. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=350.58s)]
*  That's not a racist conspiracy theory. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=352.09999999999997s)]
*  Chuck Schumer just said it! [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=354.38s)]
*  However many undocumented there are here, Schumer added. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=357.18s)]
*  So as a political matter, what is this? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=361.34s)]
*  Well, you're hearing a lot about threats to democracy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=363.38s)]
*  This is an actual threat to democracy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=365.29999999999995s)]
*  This is an actual effort to disenfranchise American voters. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=367.23999999999995s)]
*  It's an attempt to replace their vote with a new electorate. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=371.58s)]
*  So this is incredibly dark. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=376.02s)]
*  And it's not a referendum on the people coming here, most of whom are, well, they want to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  be here, so that says something good about them. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  This is a measure of the intent of the people in charge, the malice behind what they're [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=386.02s)]
*  doing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=391.82s)]
*  So it's hard to believe this could become law. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=392.96s)]
*  This could be codified since Republicans just took over the House. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=395.26s)]
*  Oh, but it could be in the lame duck session, which does not represent the recently expressed [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=399.18s)]
*  will of voters last month. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  A month ago, voters cast their ballots and they said we would like a Republican House [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=408.5s)]
*  and they got one. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=413.9s)]
*  But that's all about to be short circuited. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=416.65999999999997s)]
*  New reporting suggests that Democrats and several Republicans are working on a deal [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=419.0s)]
*  to pass mass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens before the new Congress can be seated. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=422.88s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy, the incoming House Speaker, has promised not to hold a vote for any immigration [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=429.73999999999995s)]
*  bill until the border is secure because it would be insane to do otherwise. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=434.0s)]
*  And yet several Republican members of the Senate are trying to pass a mass amnesty before [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=438.44s)]
*  the new Republican Congress is seated next month. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=443.54s)]
*  Leading that effort, and should become famous for this, is Tom Tillis, the Republican Senator [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=447.66s)]
*  of North Carolina, joined by Democrat Kirsten Sinema of Arizona. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=452.74s)]
*  According to Axios, between 10 and 12 Republican senators could join this plan. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=457.02000000000004s)]
*  That would include names you're probably familiar with. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=461.78000000000003s)]
*  Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, and as we said, Tom Tillis [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=463.5s)]
*  of North Carolina. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=470.54s)]
*  And several retiring senators, Rob Portman, Roy Blunt, Richard Burr, are also being courted [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=471.74s)]
*  to support the bill. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=476.22s)]
*  Imagine someone who's on his way out of Congress in days will be codifying a law that will [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=477.22s)]
*  change the country forever. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=484.42s)]
*  So how are they justifying this? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=487.5s)]
*  Well clearly their donors want it, right? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=489.14s)]
*  Because cheap labor is always the justification for everything. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=491.5s)]
*  It's a short-sighted view. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=493.78000000000003s)]
*  Tom Tillis is saying this is okay because it will only offer amnesty to the dreamers. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=496.5s)]
*  Barack Obama's dreamers. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=501.14s)]
*  Illegal migrants supposedly came to this country as young people. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=503.5s)]
*  So by offering amnesty to dreamers, what will happen next? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=506.82s)]
*  Well what happened last time? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=510.14s)]
*  The U.S. Congress will incentivize more foreign nationals to flood into the country. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=512.02s)]
*  And that's the whole point of it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  It's why Obama did it a decade ago. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=518.14s)]
*  So what will happen to our economy, which is at the verge of a real downturn? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=521.6999999999999s)]
*  Everyone knows that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=526.5s)]
*  Well let's see. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=527.5s)]
*  The average dreamer is 28 years old. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=528.6s)]
*  The median income of dreamers is $26,000. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=531.1s)]
*  That's far lower than the median income of Americans. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=534.3s)]
*  So that's not going to attack on anybody. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=537.3s)]
*  It's only a simple observation. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=540.3s)]
*  If the country is getting poorer, you probably don't want a lot more poverty imported. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=541.9s)]
*  Again, why is that untrue? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=547.3s)]
*  Well it is true. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=549.9s)]
*  And everyone knows it's true. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=550.9s)]
*  And no one has the brass to say it out loud, but it's real. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=551.9s)]
*  By the way, we have no idea how many dreamers or other illegal aliens are in this country. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=554.9s)]
*  The Biden administration has been working with the government of Mexico to hide those [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=560.2199999999999s)]
*  numbers for two years now from the public. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=563.3399999999999s)]
*  So much for your democracy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=567.18s)]
*  The Center for Immigration Studies just exposed this in one of the most important investigations [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=568.3s)]
*  from the border in a long time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=571.8199999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=573.78s)]
*  After this short bus drive from a Mexican government shelter across from Calexico, California, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=574.78s)]
*  Mexico's immigration service will hand them over to their American counterparts at an [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=580.6999999999999s)]
*  official port of entry. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=584.62s)]
*  With temporary legal status papers already in their folders. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=587.46s)]
*  Once CBP processes them in, they're all released to begin permanent lives working in American [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=591.62s)]
*  cities of their choice. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=597.2600000000001s)]
*  These ones and thousands more entering the same way all along the U.S.-Mexican border [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=599.94s)]
*  won't have illegally crossed a river, won't have hiked through brush, and won't have paid [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=604.98s)]
*  thousands to cartel smugglers. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=611.0s)]
*  Maybe most importantly to the Biden administration, they surely won't end up in the historically [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=613.86s)]
*  swollen politically problematic illegal crossing statistics. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  Instead, Biden's DHS legalized these people before they could commit the illegal act they [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=624.22s)]
*  intended when they left home. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=630.46s)]
*  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection pre-approved all of them while they were still in Mexico. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=633.1s)]
*  So that was... [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=641.9s)]
*  What's the word for that? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  It would be immigration fraud being committed by the Biden administration, hiding the numbers [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  so you don't realize how many people are coming into your country illegally. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  You have no role in this whatsoever. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=653.74s)]
*  Now keep that in mind when you learn that the Tom Tillis lame duck bill will include [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=656.1s)]
*  quote, $25 to $40 billion for border security. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=660.02s)]
*  That's actually a lot. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=664.74s)]
*  Not as much as we're giving to Ukraine because of course their border is a lot more important [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=665.74s)]
*  than ours. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=668.26s)]
*  Shut up, racist. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=669.26s)]
*  It's billions more than Donald Trump asked for to build the border wall. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  And at the time, senators in both parties said that was just way too expensive and racist. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=673.74s)]
*  And people just build taller ladders. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=678.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=679.54s)]
*  But now the same group is fine with $40 billion for border security. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=680.54s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=684.26s)]
*  Because they know it's fake. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=685.26s)]
*  They know it's fake. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=686.26s)]
*  You can build any structure you want, but if the officials manning the gates, like on [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=688.54s)]
*  January 6th, just to open the doors, it's meaningless. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=692.98s)]
*  And of course, Tom Tillis knows that to his eternal shame. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=696.78s)]
*  How out of it is Tom Tillis? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=700.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, watch Tom Tillis, who clearly has no grounding in the physical reality of America [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=702.18s)]
*  2022, tell you that letting all these people in, giving them citizenship is a good idea [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=707.06s)]
*  because really what we're importing is computer scientists and engineers. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=711.74s)]
*  Watch Tom Tillis. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=714.5s)]
*  I've tried to tell anyone who thinks that we just need to find more computer scientists, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=715.5s)]
*  more people with advanced degrees from the U.S. population that they need to wake up [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=722.94s)]
*  and recognize that we want our economy to continue to grow. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=727.5s)]
*  If we want to continue to build on this great economy, that we've got to look to legal [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=730.5400000000001s)]
*  immigration as a critical part of fulfilling our workforce needs and really growing our [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=736.7s)]
*  innovation economy. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=743.7s)]
*  So that's just a word salad of phrases Tom Tillis doesn't understand. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=746.74s)]
*  But think about that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=751.86s)]
*  In the last two years, thanks to COVID and the manufactured response to it in this country, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=754.14s)]
*  our public education system has completely collapsed. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=759.3s)]
*  Kids are not being educated. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=761.9399999999999s)]
*  We're not producing programmers, partly because of policies that Tom Tillis stood by and allowed [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=764.06s)]
*  to be enacted under COVID. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=770.54s)]
*  But rather than fix that, we need to legalize millions of dreamers and give them citizenship. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=773.22s)]
*  So if you really wanted a lot of computer programmers, there are a lot of them around [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=779.02s)]
*  the world, you would make an active attempt to identify them and import them and then [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=780.98s)]
*  you could tell us why. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=784.5s)]
*  But to let in people without high school educations by the millions because we need more computer [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=786.02s)]
*  programmers, now you're just lying to us Tom Tillis. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=791.58s)]
*  How stupid do you think we are? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=793.6600000000001s)]
*  Pretty stupid apparently. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=795.22s)]
*  So what's the border actually look like? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=797.02s)]
*  Well Charlie Duff, our reporter friend from Michigan, formerly The New York Times, has [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=798.34s)]
*  been to the border recently, spent a lot of time there, caught a lot on video. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=802.14s)]
*  Here's some footage that tells you who's actually coming over. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=807.46s)]
*  In the last two years, how many people have made their way into the United States? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=810.46s)]
*  I think last year was over two million. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=820.22s)]
*  And the year before that, I think just under two million. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=824.22s)]
*  And then you have the unknown number of people that got away that we have no idea that got [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=828.38s)]
*  away and then you look at the people that are overstaying visas. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=832.5s)]
*  I mean that 11 million number of illegal in the United States is just a fantasy. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=835.62s)]
*  New York complains about a thousand a month. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=840.54s)]
*  We have a thousand a day. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=842.5s)]
*  Two thousand a day. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=844.86s)]
*  Yeah, this right here is probably three, three fifty. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=845.86s)]
*  Right here? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=848.74s)]
*  In the meantime, probably a mile downstream they're probably running a bunch of dope because [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=849.74s)]
*  all our people are tied up over here with this s***. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=854.62s)]
*  That's why they send them to big groups. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=856.7s)]
*  So most Americans, because this is a pretty big country, have no idea the scale of this [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=860.1s)]
*  has been going on for two years and it will completely change this country forever and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=864.8199999999999s)]
*  it's continuing and nobody is doing anything about it. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=868.5s)]
*  And no one seems upset about it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=871.14s)]
*  Is Tom Till upset about this? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=872.3399999999999s)]
*  No, computer programmers reading his stupid libertarian talking points from 1996. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=873.6999999999999s)]
*  We're going to have a lot more footage from Charlie Leduff from the border and it shows [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=877.8199999999999s)]
*  you what's actually happening there. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=882.2199999999999s)]
*  A lot of people crossing are nice people with families who just want to work and hang drywall [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=884.18s)]
*  and that's great and everyone supports that. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=888.14s)]
*  Quite a few of them though are drug smugglers. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=890.26s)]
*  Actually, that's true. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=891.9399999999999s)]
*  This is all being orchestrated by the cartels and some of them wind up killing Americans. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=893.46s)]
*  I have five motion activated cameras. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=897.86s)]
*  I've got two way back that way and three back in the ranch here. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=900.74s)]
*  It's a very poor sample because I've had over a hundred trails coming through the ranch. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=907.86s)]
*  So five over a hundred is only five percent. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=913.6600000000001s)]
*  On those five cameras between February and October, 2,500 images. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=919.5799999999999s)]
*  An intelligence officer with the border patrol told me that he believes 20 percent are carrying drugs. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=931.8199999999999s)]
*  On this ranch, we've been here 35 years now. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=944.5400000000001s)]
*  It's a wonderful ranch except we are very ticked off that all these drug packers are [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=950.3000000000001s)]
*  coming through my ranch to poison our American people. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=959.58s)]
*  So the closer you get to the border, and this is true of Republicans and Democrats, Hispanics, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=964.7800000000001s)]
*  whites, blacks, none of that matters. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=970.46s)]
*  Any American who's close to the border is horrified by what's going on there. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=972.0600000000001s)]
*  So the only way that you could support this is by intentionally ignoring what's happening there. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=976.0600000000001s)]
*  Like Tom Tillis is and Lisa Murkowski and Joe Biden and all the rest. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=980.62s)]
*  Today, our Peter Ducey asked Biden, who's going to be in the area soon, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=984.38s)]
*  are you going to go see the border while you're down there? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=988.14s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=990.22s)]
*  There are more important things going on, right? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1000.7s)]
*  What's actually happening is the Biden administration ended the policies that would [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1007.02s)]
*  have stopped this flood of unaccompanied minors at the border and now they want to make the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1010.7800000000001s)]
*  problem even worse and they're doing it for a reason. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1015.02s)]
*  They're telling you what the reason is. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1017.4200000000001s)]
*  You're not allowed to notice but doesn't make it any less true. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1019.1s)]
*  This is real. This is happening. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1022.7s)]
*  No one's stopping it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1024.38s)]
*  Republicans are colluding to allow it to continue. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1025.26s)]
*  To catch our nightly opens, stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1030.46s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xzVEUelAo&t=1036.06s)]
