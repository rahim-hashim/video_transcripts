# Teachers can 'facilitate' students' gender and sexual transitions in Los Angeles
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA)
*  Well, the Los Angeles School District [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=0.0s)]
*  is one of the biggest in the country. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  The district is now instructing teachers [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=3.2600000000000002s)]
*  to educate children starting in kindergarten [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=4.74s)]
*  to experiment with non-binary pronouns, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=7.08s)]
*  just to kind of destroy human civilization [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=10.32s)]
*  and throw it all into chaos and confusion. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=14.36s)]
*  That's actually happening. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=16.88s)]
*  By the way, why is a school talking to your kindergartners [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=17.72s)]
*  about sex? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=21.12s)]
*  Shouldn't they be in prison for doing that? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=21.96s)]
*  Yes, they should be. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=23.52s)]
*  Chris Ruffo has proved this is going on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=24.84s)]
*  He's obtained several documents [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  from the district's equity department. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=28.26s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=29.639999999999997s)]
*  Chris, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=30.48s)]
*  Tell us what exactly is going on here, if you would. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=32.28s)]
*  So what's happening is that public school bureaucrats [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=35.62s)]
*  across the country, in this case in Los Angeles, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=38.08s)]
*  have taken the principles of academic queer theory [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  and then turned them into a K through 12 pedagogy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=43.16s)]
*  They're training kids as young as kindergarten [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=46.18s)]
*  to experiment with sexual identities, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=48.44s)]
*  such as trans, genderqueer, pansexual, genderfluid, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=50.84s)]
*  two-spirit, all of these really crazy [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=55.44s)]
*  and synthetic constructions that we once thought [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=58.28s)]
*  were relegated to academia. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=62.0s)]
*  They've now been mainlined into elementary school classrooms [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=63.36s)]
*  all over the school district in Los Angeles. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=66.94s)]
*  I really can, and I mean this sincerely, I'm confused. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=70.16s)]
*  If I find your kindergartner in the park [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=72.98s)]
*  and start talking to her about her sex life, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=75.84s)]
*  you have a moral right to punch me out and call the cops. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=78.04s)]
*  Why in the world are we allowing teachers [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=81.56s)]
*  to do the same thing? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=84.06s)]
*  Well, I think a large part of the reason [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=85.72s)]
*  is because of this illusion of authority. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=87.68s)]
*  And so the two prominent domains [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  where these ideas are being transmitted [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=92.4s)]
*  are education and the medical profession. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  And for better or worse, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  historically these have been very trusted. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  So people listen to teachers, they listen to doctors. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=100.4s)]
*  But I think this is starting to change [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=103.72s)]
*  because this is getting frankly out of control. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  And one thing that is really important to know [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=108.12s)]
*  that actually school districts like Los Angeles [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  have adopted an explicit policy [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=113.32s)]
*  that teachers can facilitate your child's gender [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  or sexual transition. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=118.72s)]
*  And the default policy is that they keep it secret [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  from parents. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  So they know that they're doing something [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=124.08s)]
*  that parents would object to. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  I have the documents that prove exactly what they're doing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  and they're trying to keep it a secret. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=131.0s)]
*  I mean, up until recently, the rule was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=133.64s)]
*  you troll my minor children about their sex life [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=135.68s)]
*  and you're gonna get hurt. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think that should be the rule still. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  It's that threatening. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=142.88s)]
*  I appreciate all you've done to bring this to light. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=144.24s)]
*  Chris Ruffo, thank you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2skqtCv5eA&t=147.0s)]
