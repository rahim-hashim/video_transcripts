# Tucker: This is a start to solving the crime problem
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=0.0s)]
*  My Block, My Hood, My City is a nonprofit organization [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=2.2s)]
*  in Chicago. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=6.3s)]
*  It's designed to teach kids [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=7.44s)]
*  how to become responsible citizens. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=8.9s)]
*  Now we can't tell you if the program actually works, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=10.74s)]
*  but we do know they seem to be aiming in the right direction. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=13.14s)]
*  Last Saturday afternoon, four members of this group [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=16.04s)]
*  went to Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=18.38s)]
*  to hang Christmas lights. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=20.28s)]
*  Pretty nice thing to do. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=21.62s)]
*  Bronzeville was once the center of Chicago's thriving [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=23.22s)]
*  black-owned business district, but at this point, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  it's just another dangerous neighborhood in a decaying city. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=27.52s)]
*  How dangerous is it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=30.78s)]
*  Well, as the kids hung their Christmas lights, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=32.18s)]
*  four thugs got out of an SUV and robbed them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=34.12s)]
*  Then a few hours later, someone set fire to a Christmas tree [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=37.16s)]
*  they had set up in a nearby park. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=39.96s)]
*  Who sets fire to Christmas trees? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=42.5s)]
*  Well, suddenly a lot of people do. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=44.7s)]
*  Last December, the same group of volunteers in Chicago [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=46.64s)]
*  had another one of their Christmas trees [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=49.16s)]
*  burned to the ground. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  The year before that, someone ran over the Christmas tree [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  in Chicago's Washington Park with a car. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=54.18s)]
*  So there seems to be quite a bit of Christmas tree [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  destroying going on all of a sudden. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=61.7s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=63.24s)]
*  This isn't just a matter of people setting fire [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=64.58s)]
*  to balsam firs. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=66.92s)]
*  A Christmas tree is a symbol. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=68.64s)]
*  It's a symbol of a specific culture. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=70.62s)]
*  It's a symbol of a much-loved tradition [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=72.42s)]
*  that is hundreds of years old. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=74.38s)]
*  But above all, it's a symbol of a religion, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=76.16s)]
*  in this case, the world's largest religion. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  Torching Christmas trees is an attack on Christianity. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=80.76s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=84.26s)]
*  It's an assault on religious observance. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=85.42s)]
*  By current standards, destroying someone's religious symbol [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=87.98s)]
*  would be called a hate crime. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=90.76s)]
*  That's a category much-beloved and meticulously chronicled [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=92.7s)]
*  by the Biden Justice Department. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  The DOJ can tell you precisely how many Korans [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=98.06s)]
*  were burned last year in the United States, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  but they don't keep track of Christmas trees. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=103.5s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, because they could care less. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=106.44s)]
*  Christopher Wray isn't dispatching a team of FBI agents [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=108.14000000000001s)]
*  to get to the bottom of Christmas arson. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Merrick Garland is not gonna issue a press release [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=113.33999999999999s)]
*  about it, trust us. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=115.63999999999999s)]
*  The media, for their part, find the whole thing hilarious. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=117.33999999999999s)]
*  After a Christmas display was vandalized three years [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=120.77999999999999s)]
*  in a row in a park in Chicago, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=123.24s)]
*  most recently this past weekend, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=124.78s)]
*  CBS News produced this headline, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=126.74s)]
*  "'Search on for Grinch Who Burned Down Christmas Tree.'" [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=128.88s)]
*  Oh, so it's a Grinch. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=133.56s)]
*  Not an arsonist, not a dangerous anti-Christian psychopath. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=135.29999999999998s)]
*  No, it's a Grinch, an amusing, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=139.06s)]
*  dwarfishly cute cartoon character [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=140.5s)]
*  absolutely nobody can take seriously. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=142.38000000000002s)]
*  But this is serious, these are not isolated incidents, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=145.02s)]
*  and they're not being perpetrated by Grinches. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=148.0s)]
*  In Oakland, California, a few days ago, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  a still unidentified arsonist doused a 52-foot Christmas tree [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=152.52s)]
*  in Jack London Square with lighter fluid [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=155.94000000000003s)]
*  and then burned it down. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  Just this morning, right after midnight, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=159.68s)]
*  in the center of Midtown Manhattan, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=161.5s)]
*  someone torched the Christmas tree [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=163.5s)]
*  right outside Fox News headquarters. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=165.0s)]
*  It went up in smoke while Shannon Bream [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=167.28000000000003s)]
*  was live on the air. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=168.82000000000002s)]
*  All right, a bit of breaking news for you tonight. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=170.66s)]
*  You're looking at live images. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=173.1s)]
*  This is the Fox Square in New York [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  outside of Fox headquarters. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=177.2s)]
*  It appears that our giant Christmas tree there [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=178.34s)]
*  just a couple minutes ago was completely engulfed in flames. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=181.0s)]
*  It appears crews are there on the scene. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  You see the smoke in the aftermath. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=185.62s)]
*  They're trying to get that under control. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=186.78s)]
*  So in this case, in the case of the tree [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=189.78s)]
*  right in front of Fox News in Manhattan, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=191.7s)]
*  police caught the man, they say, did it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=193.22s)]
*  They tell us his name is Craig Tomahawna. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=194.78s)]
*  He had a lighter in his pocket. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=197.54s)]
*  Fox security saw him start the fire [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=198.68s)]
*  after he climbed the tree. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=200.36s)]
*  Why did Tomahawna do this? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=202.06s)]
*  Well, we don't know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=203.56s)]
*  But the more obvious question is, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  why was he on the street in the first place? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=206.52s)]
*  According to New York's police commissioner, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=209.02s)]
*  Tomahawna was wanted on several criminal offenses. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  Quote, he was issued earlier this year [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=213.16s)]
*  some appearance tickets and didn't come back to court, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=215.16s)]
*  which is something we see all too often. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  So here we have yet another criminal set free [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=221.28s)]
*  by left-wing ideologues to terrorize everyone else. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  This is the third arson attack on a Christmas tree, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=227.82s)]
*  at least in a major American city in the past week. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  Time to connect some dots here? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=234.42s)]
*  No. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=236.26s)]
*  Here's the New York Times headline, quote, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=237.34s)]
*  Fox News Christmas tree catches fire in Manhattan. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=239.1s)]
*  Right, so it turns out the tree just caught fire. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=243.1s)]
*  It self-immolated the usual spontaneous combustion [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=246.1s)]
*  at work in Midtown, just like that red SUV [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=248.5s)]
*  that went rogue after the Rittenhouse verdict in Wisconsin [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=250.98s)]
*  and by itself murdered children and grandmothers [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=253.78s)]
*  in a parade, because sometimes these things just happen. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=256.14000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't that long ago you should know [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  that the New York Times was a semi-legitimate newspaper [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=261.5s)]
*  that reported the news. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=264.26000000000005s)]
*  It wasn't always a Stalinist propaganda outlet designed [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=266.14000000000004s)]
*  to confirm the bigotries of the smallest minded, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=269.14000000000004s)]
*  unhappiest, most self-satisfied people in America. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=272.14000000000004s)]
*  In other words, it wasn't always NPR. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=274.94s)]
*  But now it is, and very few people are still listening. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=277.70000000000005s)]
*  Everyone who actually lives in this country [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  knows exactly what's going on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=283.82s)]
*  Look around. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=285.26s)]
*  Our streets are dangerous, much more dangerous [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=286.34s)]
*  than they've been in a long time, in decades. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  There are a lot of reasons for that, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=290.98s)]
*  but one reason is our cities are overrun [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=292.26s)]
*  with mentally unstable vagrants [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=295.3s)]
*  who are living on the sidewalks. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=296.98s)]
*  Now, for a long time, we've called these people homeless, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=299.14s)]
*  but let's stop doing that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=302.3s)]
*  The homeless is a political term [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=303.7s)]
*  which is intentionally devised to mislead you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=306.26s)]
*  In fact, this problem has very little to do with homes [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  or available housing or whatever Orwellian phrase [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=312.54s)]
*  they're using at this point [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=315.98s)]
*  to pretend these people have no place to stay. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=316.98s)]
*  A lot of them could be staying indoors. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=319.14000000000004s)]
*  They don't want to because they're addicted to drugs. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=321.74s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=324.86s)]
*  America has a massive drug crisis now in progress. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=325.94s)]
*  The rest of us have been trained to ignore it or deny it, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=329.90000000000003s)]
*  but it's absolutely real. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=333.70000000000005s)]
*  And if you live in a city, you cannot pretend it isn't. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=335.22s)]
*  Andrew Yang ran for mayor of New York this spring, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=338.66s)]
*  and at one point made the mistake of saying [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=340.94s)]
*  what every single person in Manhattan knows to be true. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=342.62s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=346.7s)]
*  The fact is mentally ill homeless men [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=348.26s)]
*  are changing the character of our neighborhoods. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=350.73999999999995s)]
*  A woman my wife, Ellen, is friends with [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=353.73999999999995s)]
*  in her mom group in Hell's Kitchen [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=356.38s)]
*  was punched in the face by a mentally ill man, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=357.7s)]
*  sent a picture of her bruised face around the mom group [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=359.65999999999997s)]
*  spread like wildfire. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=361.82s)]
*  This is happening in New York City, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=363.17999999999995s)]
*  and we're not talking enough about it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=364.82s)]
*  Families are leaving as a result. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=366.58s)]
*  In East Harlem, the neighborhood has been changed. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=368.58s)]
*  In Upper West Side, the neighborhood has been changed. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=370.46s)]
*  We owe our people and our families better than this, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  and I'm frustrated by the political nature [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=375.26s)]
*  of these responses. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=377.58s)]
*  I mean, we're not talking about housing affordability. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=378.94s)]
*  We're talking about the hundreds of mentally ill people [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=381.14s)]
*  we all see around us every day [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=383.46s)]
*  on the streets and the subways. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=385.18s)]
*  There will be no recovery until we resolve this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=386.7s)]
*  I will fix this, New York. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=389.17999999999995s)]
*  So here you have an innocent mother [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=392.94s)]
*  punched in the face on the street. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=395.46s)]
*  Now you'd think the Violence Against Women Caucus [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=397.74s)]
*  might have something to say about this, but no. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=400.58s)]
*  Instead, they attacked Andrew Yang for noting it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=403.06s)]
*  Andrew Yang's comments about mental illness [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=405.94s)]
*  are deeply offensive, barked Teen Vogue, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=407.82s)]
*  which is an even stupider version of the New York Times. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  Democratic mayoral candidate Maya Willey denounced [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=413.74s)]
*  Yang's description of violent crime as, quote, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=416.22s)]
*  deeply disturbing, deeply lacking in compassion. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  Unmentioned was the woman who got punched in the face [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=422.5s)]
*  by the lunatic. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=424.66s)]
*  No compassion for her. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=426.58s)]
*  Violence Against Women doesn't count [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=428.26s)]
*  when it's the homeless committing it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=429.58s)]
*  In the end, Andrew Yang lost the mayor's race, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=431.46s)]
*  but the mentally ill drug addicts who punch women [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=433.74s)]
*  in the face are still there. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=436.02s)]
*  They're still roaming Midtown. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=437.14s)]
*  They're a protected class. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=438.62s)]
*  According to the Washington Post, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=440.94s)]
*  these people must now be referred to as unhoused individuals [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=442.1s)]
*  or people experiencing homelessness. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=445.78000000000003s)]
*  In other words, they have a right to live in tents [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=448.3s)]
*  across from your house, shooting heroin with their pants down [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=450.82s)]
*  as you walk your kids to school. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=453.94s)]
*  They really think that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=456.38s)]
*  When the city of Washington, DC moved [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=457.82s)]
*  in the encampment of junkies recently, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=459.66s)]
*  one city councilman described this as, quote, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=461.38s)]
*  an eviction. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=463.3s)]
*  In other words, your streets belong to them. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=464.58s)]
*  Now these aren't just misguided attitudes. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=469.14s)]
*  They are suicidal attitudes. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=471.22s)]
*  Any society that gives drug addicts preference [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=473.5s)]
*  over homeowners will not last long. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=475.82s)]
*  In the meantime, people die. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=479.02s)]
*  People die who don't deserve to die. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=480.26s)]
*  In Florida the other day, a vagrant murdered [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=482.34s)]
*  a 14 year old boy who was out riding his bike. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=484.14s)]
*  Police say the killer is called Semile Williams. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=486.85999999999996s)]
*  He had felony arrests in Georgia and California, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=489.09999999999997s)]
*  including charges for aggravated assault and battery. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=491.34s)]
*  Why was he in jail? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=493.78s)]
*  Well, because authorities in Georgia and California [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=495.62s)]
*  let him go. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=497.38s)]
*  So he went to Florida and murdered a child. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=498.5s)]
*  He appears to be a homeless drifter [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=501.65999999999997s)]
*  spending most of his time in the streets of Miami. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=504.05999999999995s)]
*  The incident itself appears to be a completely random act [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=507.05999999999995s)]
*  We do not have a motive in this case. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  It appears to be an absolute chance encounter [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=514.82s)]
*  between a child on a bicycle and an animal [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=518.4200000000001s)]
*  that probably should not be out on our streets. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=522.94s)]
*  It appears to be a random act. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=526.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, you do wonder about that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=527.46s)]
*  But he called him an animal that probably should not be out [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=529.58s)]
*  on our streets. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=532.4200000000001s)]
*  And that is absolutely true. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=533.26s)]
*  Saying that out loud will not return this boy [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=534.4200000000001s)]
*  to his parents. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=536.34s)]
*  He is dead. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=537.22s)]
*  But saying it out loud is a start. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=538.82s)]
*  You cannot solve problems until you resolve [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=540.46s)]
*  to stop lying about them, which we should do. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzM93bOSWNc&t=542.9000000000001s)]
