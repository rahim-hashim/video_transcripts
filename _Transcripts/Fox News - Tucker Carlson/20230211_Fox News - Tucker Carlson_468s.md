# Roseanne Barr: I was totally ‘cancelled'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U)
*  Roseanne Barr has one of the most remarkable life trajectories of anyone we've ever met [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=0.0s)]
*  and learned more from it than most people, that's for sure. She started at the very bottom, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=5.84s)]
*  then out of nowhere she created and wrote one of the most successful sitcoms of all time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=12.4s)]
*  And so her career, of course, she's Roseanne Barr, was thriving, and then she made the mistake of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=18.0s)]
*  making fun of Barack Obama's best friend, Valerie Jarrett, and her career was completely destroyed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=23.6s)]
*  They tried to destroy her personal life too. But she is back, she's hard to defeat, she's got a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  brand new stand-up special on Fox Nation called Roseanne Barr, cancel this, here's part of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=34.56s)]
*  Man, I had a rough couple of years there. I got fired because basically I racially [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=40.08s)]
*  misgendered somebody I thought was a white woman. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Woo! [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=53.6s)]
*  Huh? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=58.08s)]
*  I know, I thought the b**** was white, it's true! [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=60.64s)]
*  A lot of us thought that in our defense. We're sitting down for a full hour with Roseanne Barr, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=65.76s)]
*  it'll be on Fox Nation, but she joins us now on set. Roseanne, thank you so much for coming. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=71.28s)]
*  Thanks for having me, I'm so excited to be on with you. Well, we're going to get into all the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  details you were like, we had dinner last night, I was just, I was, there was a lot I didn't know about. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=81.28s)]
*  Wasn't that fun? The best. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=84.72s)]
*  Delicious too. Absolutely the best. And we'll get into that, but for the purposes of this segment, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  what is this special and why is it on Fox Nation, what are you doing and why? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=91.28s)]
*  Well, it's kind of a return to stand-up after many years, and they offered me, you know, to come and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=95.76s)]
*  do a stand-up special, and it was in response to being, you know, fired, and they came to my defense, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=102.48s)]
*  and I was like, well, I thought about it, and I was like, yeah, I need to have my say, I need to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=110.4s)]
*  answer, because, you know, I was kind of not allowed to even apologize for what happened. I was just [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  like blackballed and, you know, just totally canceled from even commenting on what happened. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=124.64s)]
*  So I thought, well, you know, stand-up is a great place to come back and say what happened and tell [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=133.68s)]
*  the truth about it, and also to talk about cancel culture itself and how horrible it is and how [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=139.92s)]
*  fascist. And jokes are a great way to, you know, scorn power, especially during Biden's presidency. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=145.92s)]
*  I love laughing at the scorn because it deserves to be laughed to scorn. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=160.88s)]
*  And my jokes are so great. They're the most offensive. I was talking to my friends who also [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=161.44s)]
*  were canceled, and we all were saying we made a pact together. When we come back, we're going to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  be even more offensive than we've ever been before. So my stand-up is more offensive than I've ever been, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=171.2s)]
*  and I'm so happy because you've got to be more offensive when the culture is so offensive that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=178.0s)]
*  it makes absolutely no sense that it's anti-life, anti-human, anti-culture, anti-citizen. You've got [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=184.72s)]
*  to be so offensive to offend the most offensive thing that is on earth right now, and I think I've [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=193.04s)]
*  done it. That's a very high bar. I just want to go one sentence back. You have friends, there's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=199.12s)]
*  a community of people who've been canceled? Like, you know each other. Comedians, you know, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  especially comedians, because, you know, like I told you last night, I was terrified when Obama [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=211.76s)]
*  signed the NDAA thing because I said, my God, this is an attack on comedy, and all the comics [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=217.6s)]
*  were talking about it. It's like we will not be able to say anything now, and it's true, and it's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=223.2s)]
*  funny that I said that on Twitter and that I was the first casualty of cancel culture in a large way. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=228.24s)]
*  But, you know, so many of other comics have fallen too and can't find work and, you know, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=234.72s)]
*  have no livelihood because, you know, unless they, you know, are ridiculously sucking up to what [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=241.84s)]
*  the left considers to be... Well, the left has no humor at all, so let's be real. They have no [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=249.76s)]
*  sense of humor at all, nor do they have any sense of humor about themselves. Like anybody in power [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=254.96s)]
*  who can't take a joke about themselves, like the person I mentioned, she should have just laughed it [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  off. But instead, she called ABC and demanded that I be fired. And so why can't you just laugh at [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=266.56s)]
*  yourself, you know? Somebody in power who can't even laugh at themselves, that's a dangerous human [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=273.52s)]
*  being, and this is what they say Obama's third term, so look around. I think I was pretty right on [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  in my, you know, nobody understood my tweet because they lack the geopolitical background [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=287.2s)]
*  to even understand it. They're like, oh, she said to me, you know, they're just idiots. So, but if [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=294.64s)]
*  you can't even laugh at yourself, you're a dangerous human being, and you have power and you have no [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  sense of humor about yourself that comedians say, that's dangerous. It's so dangerous. Isn't it? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  I could not... It's just fascist. I could not agree more. And also, the power differential is fascinating to me, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=312.64s)]
*  so here you are... Oh, I was going to say, and this is her third term because she is Obama's brain. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=317.28s)]
*  She got you fired, so how exactly... And you're one of the most famous comedians in the world, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  and she got you fired from your job and humiliated and kind of overturned your life. She had the power [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=327.44s)]
*  to do that, so how is it that she has the right to be offended by what, you know, like she shouldn't [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=332.88s)]
*  be offended. She's in power. I know, because they never... These people, they're always the victim. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  They bully, bully, bully, bully, and then when they're called on being a bully, they call it, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=344.88s)]
*  it was me, then they're the victim. The endless bully victim thing. It's two sides of the same [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=350.16s)]
*  coin, and they're trying to turn our entire culture into bully, bully, victim, and it's just not going [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  to work, and my jokes are kind of to that effect. Why are we calling these people victims that are [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  actually bullies? Yes, and way more powerful than we are. Powerful enough to get Roseanne Barr fired [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  from her TV show. Yeah, and they enjoyed... Oh my God, they enjoyed doing it. They really enjoyed it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=373.92s)]
*  Yeah, they enjoy that. They do. They enjoy stigma. Well, you were talking about the whole [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=380.72s)]
*  climate culture religion. They enjoy inflicting pain. Oh, I'm sure they sit there and go, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=388.56s)]
*  yeah, we're going to cut... You know, like old people can't get their pain meds. I hear this all [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=394.8s)]
*  the time as my mom's old. They deny old people in their 80s pain meds. They like that. They like [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=400.16s)]
*  inflicting because, you know, it's basically... It's like it is fascist and Nazi. They do experiments [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=407.68s)]
*  on captive populations. No different, and it's disgusting, and then we're supposed to see that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=414.8s)]
*  as progressive. It's not. It's anything but. I just wanted to say it. I'm not going to let them have [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=420.88s)]
*  the last word, not on me. I'll be fighting in my depends on a damn... I don't care. I'm never going [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=429.52s)]
*  to give up. They're not going to get me. Okay. Anybody who just heard what you said will be [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gojtvz_73U&t=437.2s)]
