# Dave Portnoy hits back at 'sleazy' hit piece on 'Tucker'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc)
*  Well, here's the story for you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=0.0s)]
*  Dave Portnoy is the founder, of course, of Barstool Sports. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=1.52s)]
*  He's a cultural icon. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=3.88s)]
*  Portnoy is not especially political. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=5.2s)]
*  He seems a lot more interested in stock tips [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=6.96s)]
*  than election polling. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  But he is unapologetically American, always has been. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  He thinks you ought to be allowed to say [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=12.6s)]
*  what you really think in this country, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=13.84s)]
*  even if NBC News doesn't like it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=16.4s)]
*  So that attitude and his success as a publisher [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=18.96s)]
*  has made Portnoy a massive threat [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=21.72s)]
*  to legacy media organizations. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=23.72s)]
*  They truly hate him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  So last week, they decided to destroy his life. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=27.36s)]
*  A sleazy little blog called Business Insider [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=30.0s)]
*  dispatched a robot reporter to snoop around [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=33.12s)]
*  in Portnoy's sex life. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=35.56s)]
*  They didn't find anything illegal [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=37.54s)]
*  or even especially surprising, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=39.04s)]
*  but they tried their best to humiliate him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Now they're harassing his advertisers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=42.64s)]
*  The question is, can this business insider, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  whoever that is, succeed in killing Dave Portnoy? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=47.8s)]
*  And that's a question that anyone who's interested [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=51.04s)]
*  in free speech and the free exchange of ideas [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=53.0s)]
*  should probably care about. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=54.96s)]
*  To answer it, we've invited Dave Portnoy himself [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=56.66s)]
*  to join us tonight and we're grateful that he has. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=58.9s)]
*  Dave, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=61.04s)]
*  So I guess the rules are, they don't like your posture, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=62.26s)]
*  the cut of your jib, your attitude, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=66.94s)]
*  you don't take orders, so they send some little robot [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=69.22s)]
*  to snoop around in your personal life, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=73.24s)]
*  don't find anything illegal, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=74.94s)]
*  but print all this stuff anonymously about your sex life [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=76.78s)]
*  and then try to destroy you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=79.94s)]
*  Like, these are the rules now? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=80.97999999999999s)]
*  Seems that eight months, so I've heard about this article, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=83.06s)]
*  this hit piece that they had in the works for eight months. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=87.66s)]
*  I'm talking everybody that was attached to me [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=90.58s)]
*  on social media, people I didn't even know, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=92.66s)]
*  people who talked about me, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=94.74s)]
*  every single person attached to me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  This reporter reached out and basically had leading questions. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=98.46s)]
*  Hey, any dirt on Dave Portnoy, anything bad defined? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=101.62s)]
*  They found virtually nothing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=104.5s)]
*  Two examples, I'd argue, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=105.9s)]
*  both which I have unequivocally provided proof [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=107.82s)]
*  that they're not telling the truth [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=110.9s)]
*  and beyond that, not only me, there's one instance, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=112.42s)]
*  there's this actual police report [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  that reads like it's from the Onion. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=116.5s)]
*  I'm basically accused of going to a local cookie shop [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=118.06s)]
*  with a different girl every few days. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=121.38s)]
*  So that is the gist of it, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=123.42s)]
*  how they are allowed to publish this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=125.38s)]
*  and they couch it in a very, I guess, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=127.5s)]
*  smart for them, they never accuse me of anything. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=130.22s)]
*  They just lead you to water [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=133.94s)]
*  and want you to drink with sensationalistic headlines [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=135.5s)]
*  that if I read about myself not knowing me, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=138.3s)]
*  I'm like, ooh, this is a bad guy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=140.34s)]
*  If you dig into it, there's absolutely nothing there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=141.98s)]
*  They reach out to our advertisers as you say and say, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=145.5s)]
*  hey, are you advertising with Dave [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  because we're gonna write an article about how bad he is. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=151.14s)]
*  What's the proof? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=153.5s)]
*  Our own article. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=154.38s)]
*  I've offered them the chance to discuss it with me [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=155.42s)]
*  with their own cameras, their own recorders, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=158.5s)]
*  as many people as they want to have a discussion [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  so we can go back and forth. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  I can say, hey, these facts directly dispute what you wrote. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=165.26s)]
*  They won't do it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=169.06s)]
*  They said, don't talk to us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  They won't even discuss it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=171.14s)]
*  They print and run. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=172.61999999999998s)]
*  They print and run. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  It's disgusting and it's character assassination. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=175.17999999999998s)]
*  My lawyers have said, just let it go. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=177.94s)]
*  It'll go away. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=179.42s)]
*  I'm not gonna let it go because this behavior, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=180.26s)]
*  I've never been attacked like this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  I've been attacked for two decades [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=185.1s)]
*  but never escalated to this length [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=186.61999999999998s)]
*  and frankly, it's scary. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  I didn't know that you could do this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=191.94s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  There are a lot of interesting things here [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=195.33999999999997s)]
*  but Business Insider was founded by a guy [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  who pledged a securities fraud [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=198.33999999999997s)]
*  and admitted lying to investors, which I, you know, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=199.7s)]
*  so it's like, I don't know, maybe don't throw stones [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=201.98s)]
*  but this is a publication [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  supposed to be covering business. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=205.78s)]
*  You run a business. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=206.82s)]
*  You've been really successful in business. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=207.66s)]
*  You gotta kind of wonder why you, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=209.22s)]
*  you're not running for anything. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=211.06s)]
*  Like, is there a business angle, do you think, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=212.14s)]
*  in their decision to try and destroy you? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=214.06s)]
*  It's weird because I'm being treated [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=217.66s)]
*  as though I'm a politician [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=219.14s)]
*  and politics is the dirtiest game ever. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=220.33999999999997s)]
*  I will say Penn, which is a Penn National, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=222.17999999999998s)]
*  which is involved with Barstool. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=225.5s)]
*  There's a lot of Penn stock. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=227.78s)]
*  Penn stock had their earnings [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=229.14s)]
*  the day this article dropped, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=230.89999999999998s)]
*  the day this article dropped. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=232.82s)]
*  There's 365 days in a year. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=234.5s)]
*  It dropped the same day, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=236.45999999999998s)]
*  the day before there was wild shorting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  Basically people betting against Penn. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=241.17999999999998s)]
*  You can bet on a stock against it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=243.1s)]
*  For some reason, tons of people bet against it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  The day before it dropped, as you mentioned, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  Henry Blodgett was convicted for SEC fraud. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=249.66s)]
*  He can never trade stocks the rest of his life. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=253.22s)]
*  He stole working people's money. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=255.26s)]
*  That's the CEO of the company that wrote this hit piece. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=256.94s)]
*  That's just unbelievable. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=260.5s)]
*  I mean, from my perspective, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=261.9s)]
*  not involved in your business or any of this stuff, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=263.06s)]
*  it's just important that people say what they really mean [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=266.1s)]
*  and that we have space [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=269.3s)]
*  for someone who's unapologetically honest [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=270.46s)]
*  and maybe not feminized. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=273.62s)]
*  And so I just am really rooting for you to survive this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=275.5s)]
*  And I know that you will. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=277.94s)]
*  Dave Portnoy, thank you for coming on. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QxmoI8Ujuc&t=278.78s)]
