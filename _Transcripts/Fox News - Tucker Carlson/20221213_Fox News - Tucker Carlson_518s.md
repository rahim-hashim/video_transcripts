# Mike Tyson: 'My disadvantage was my advantage'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY)
*  Mike Tyson is not the sort of person we generally interview on the show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=0.0s)]
*  He's not a political figure. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=6.92s)]
*  He's not still boxing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=8.64s)]
*  Why did we talk to him? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=10.84s)]
*  Well, because Mike Tyson has spent almost 40 years at the very pinnacle of American [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=12.32s)]
*  society. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=17.48s)]
*  Then, at the very bottom, he went to prison at one point. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=18.48s)]
*  He's seen everything. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=21.04s)]
*  And a lot of people who lead lives like that are destroyed by them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=23.76s)]
*  They become numb and insensible, particularly if they're boxers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=26.88s)]
*  But a rare few become wise and fascinating and able to communicate what they've learned. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  And Tyson is definitely in that category. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=36.36s)]
*  So for a brand new episode of Tucker Carlson Today, we sat down with Tyson and we began [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=38.96s)]
*  by asking him, what was it like growing up? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=42.8s)]
*  Here's part of that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=46.8s)]
*  I'm not shaving them off. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm really proud of my childhood. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  But no advantages? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=57.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=58.12s)]
*  My disadvantage was my advantage. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=59.12s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=61.12s)]
*  My adversity inspired me to be more than what I truly was. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=62.72s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=69.08s)]
*  So you are inspired by Ali. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=71.0s)]
*  Then you go to a different reform school. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=74.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  And they have a former fighter there who trains you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  Is that the point when you realize you're going to do this for a living? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=79.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=81.24s)]
*  But this is what, since when I came there, I was in another facility on that campus. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=82.24s)]
*  And I believe I, I don't want to say I stabbed somebody, but I had an altercation with somebody. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  So I came and he met me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  I had handcuffs and I'm rearrested. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  And I was a mess. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  And so when I was, when the guys were talking to me, because they wanted, they said, well, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=97.4s)]
*  you're not a bad guy because you did that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=101.84s)]
*  So we talked, he said, we have an ex-fighter, Bobby Stewart. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=103.44s)]
*  You need to meet him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  He'll probably get you in shape. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  And I said, well, I'd love to meet him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  I met Muhammad Ali. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  I've seen Muhammad Ali once. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  And then this guy knocks on my door. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=111.64000000000001s)]
*  I heard you want to talk to me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  I said, I want to be a fighter. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=115.36s)]
*  He said, everybody wants to be a fighter. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  He showed me you want to be a fighter. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=117.88s)]
*  Let's just see how your conduct is. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=118.88s)]
*  And I went from being a really jerky, nasty guy to becoming the ace dude. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=120.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=124.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=125.88s)]
*  And then he started training me. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=126.88s)]
*  What was it about that? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=129.2s)]
*  Is it the discipline that he imposed? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=130.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  I wanted to be a fighter so bad. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  If you hadn't become a professional boxer, what would you have done? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=137.44s)]
*  I was going to be that champ. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=138.44s)]
*  You knew you were going to be at what age? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  Um, 13. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  14. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  And four years later, you were? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Seven years later. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Seven years later. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  So, when did you meet Kustomata? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  When I was 12. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  I was at the facility, and the guy drove me to meet him. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  Because I made my levels of that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=163.8s)]
*  I was a trustee now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=165.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=166.8s)]
*  I was a good kid, a trustee, so I can go to get, I can get off campus and go visit them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=167.8s)]
*  What was he like? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=172.8s)]
*  Total disciplinarian. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=174.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=175.72s)]
*  Take no ****. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=176.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=177.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I needed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=178.72s)]
*  Not a weak, not a weak man. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=179.72s)]
*  No, no signs of weakness. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=181.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=182.72s)]
*  No signs of weakness. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=183.72s)]
*  If you didn't conduct yourself the way he conducted yourself, you're not Italian. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=184.72s)]
*  He's going to tell you what Italian is. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=187.72s)]
*  If he saw like, what are those guys, Paulie Shaw, what's the Paulie name? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  The Italian guys, the Jersey Shaw guys? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=194.72000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  This is not Italian. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=197.72000000000003s)]
*  I said, Cuss, they're Italian. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  They are not Italian. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=199.72000000000003s)]
*  He would say something like that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=200.72000000000003s)]
*  If you don't conduct yourself, Italians only conduct themselves like this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=203.64s)]
*  He's not Italian. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=206.64s)]
*  He was, he was that kind of guy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=209.64s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=211.64s)]
*  So when... [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=212.64s)]
*  Nothing playful. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=213.64s)]
*  Nothing playful. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=214.64s)]
*  Nothing playful? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=215.64s)]
*  We had the team and took behind his back, there was nothing playful about him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=216.64s)]
*  And you liked that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=221.44s)]
*  Hey, know what? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=222.44s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=223.44s)]
*  Someone cared about me. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=224.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=225.44s)]
*  And if anybody say something to me, I punch him in the face, I tackle. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=226.44s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=232.16s)]
*  Because most teenage boys... [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=235.16s)]
*  You don't say nothing about me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=236.16s)]
*  I attack you physically. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=238.16s)]
*  Were you ever afraid? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=241.16s)]
*  I was always afraid of him. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=242.16s)]
*  I'm afraid of him now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=244.16s)]
*  Like that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=246.16s)]
*  He made sure you were afraid of him. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=248.16s)]
*  And you liked that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=250.16s)]
*  Listen, we were on the third floor, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=252.16s)]
*  We're talking crap. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=254.16s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about girls and stuff. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=255.16s)]
*  And then we hear, he's coming up and everybody stop talking. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  And then he comes and says, hey, I heard everybody laughing from the first floor. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=260.88000000000005s)]
*  I come up here and you're not laughing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=263.88000000000005s)]
*  I want to know what's funny. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=264.88000000000005s)]
*  I want to laugh too. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=265.88000000000005s)]
*  There's nothing because we were just talking. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=266.88000000000005s)]

*  Hey, listen. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=372.86s)]
*  Anytime I saw a white guy was a judge, a cop, he was a victim. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=375.86s)]
*  And I come to this guy's house, and this guy showed me love. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=379.98s)]

*  One of the reasons I wanted to interview you [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=386.22s)]
*  is because you're the author of one of my favorite quotes [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  ever in English, which is, everybody's got a plan [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=391.5s)]
*  till he gets hit in the face. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=394.98s)]
*  100%. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  Because people now, especially now, no one's going to fight. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  People like talking now. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=399.92s)]
*  They get on the stage, they get on YouTube, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=401.0s)]
*  and they start talking. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=402.8s)]
*  And that's why some people are not [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=404.24s)]
*  made for handling criticism. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=406.92s)]
*  They're just not made for it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=409.6s)]
*  Some people go off the deep end if you criticize them. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=410.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=413.08000000000004s)]
*  Some people just can't handle it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=414.0s)]
*  And some of the most powerful people in the world [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  just can't handle it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=418.36s)]
*  They're not mature enough to handle criticism. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  Have you gotten better at handling criticism [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=423.04s)]
*  as you've gotten older? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=425.12s)]
*  Yes, but mostly, yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=426.42s)]
*  But it's still, it can get even better. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=431.7s)]
*  Sometimes I get in my head and think I'm somebody. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=435.82s)]
*  And then I'm easily offended. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=439.58s)]
*  But when I know I'm nobody, I could never be offended. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=441.14s)]
*  Boy, is that a deep insight. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=445.42s)]
*  Sometimes I get in my head that I'm somebody [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=447.66s)]
*  and I'm easily offended. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=449.74s)]
*  And then I remind myself I'm nobody and I'm not offended. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=450.9s)]
*  Exactly 100%. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=453.06s)]
*  So if you're that well known and everywhere you go, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=455.06s)]
*  people are sucking up to you and taking pictures with you, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=460.08s)]
*  how do you remind yourself, as you said, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=462.76s)]
*  that actually I'm nobody? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=465.54s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=467.24s)]
*  God did this. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=468.52s)]
*  I asked for this and this is what he gave me. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=469.2s)]
*  It's not like someone gave me something I didn't acquire. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=471.04s)]
*  I wanted this life. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=474.68s)]
*  I prayed for this life. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=476.2s)]
*  And I received it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=477.68s)]
*  When I think I'm somebody, I'm offended. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=482.36s)]
*  When I remember I'm nobody, I'm not. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M18xBZyAxwY&t=484.0s)]
