# PayPal co-founder who helped fund recall effort against Boudin speaks out
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI)
*  I tell you what's not a good solution is having police who could be investigating unsolved [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=0.0s)]
*  rapes and murders get distracted with paperwork to give citations to people who don't have [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=4.96s)]
*  anywhere to use the toilet in private. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=11.0s)]
*  Oh, so there's human feces on the sidewalk, but it's your fault for not building more [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=13.6s)]
*  public toilets. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=19.36s)]
*  How about no crapping on the sidewalk? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=20.36s)]
*  How does that sound? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=21.64s)]
*  And that is the message actually that San Francisco voters sent yesterday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=22.76s)]
*  And the reason they were able to trace this back to a man called David Sacks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=25.88s)]
*  He's one of the people who funded this recall election. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  He's the co-founder of Kraft Ventures, where he's a partner. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=34.0s)]
*  He's also the former CEO of PayPal. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=36.04s)]
*  And we're happy to have him join us tonight to celebrate the triumph of democracy in his [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=38.48s)]
*  city, San Francisco. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=41.8s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=42.8s)]
*  Were you surprised by the margins here? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=44.76s)]
*  They seemed huge given the city. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  You know, Boudin tried to portray this recall as a Republican recall. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  They called it Trumpist. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=56.0s)]
*  But, you know, only 7 percent of San Francisco voters are registered Republicans. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=57.0s)]
*  It's a 90 percent Democrat city. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=62.08s)]
*  And so the 60 percent majority shows you that mainstream Democrats and moderates throughout [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  the city rejected this sort of radical progressive agenda. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=69.32s)]
*  And so I think what you're seeing now is some boundary lines are being drawn inside the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=73.12s)]
*  Democratic Party where average Democratic voters are starting to push back against the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=76.6s)]
*  activists and the woke billionaires, the donor class and the unions and the special [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=81.08s)]
*  interests who are trying to push a agenda that's out of step even with the liberal citizens [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=85.32s)]
*  of San Francisco. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  And the idea that this is some sort of Trumpist effort, you merely, whatever your politics [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=93.08s)]
*  are, stepped in and gave voters the opportunity to weigh in because it is an emergency what's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=97.6s)]
*  happening in your city. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=102.56s)]
*  I think it's fair to say. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=103.56s)]
*  So you just allowed democracy to take place. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=104.56s)]
*  How could anyone complain about that? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=107.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=109.2s)]
*  And, you know, it wasn't just me. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  There are many other organizations and individuals who contributed who, you know, are registered [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=111.64s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  And so it was very much a broad based effort of people in San Francisco rejecting this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  sort of radical decarcerationist agenda where Chase Aboudin had this idea that he could [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=123.04s)]
*  make San Francisco safer by emptying out the jails and releasing or decreasing the prison [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=128.12s)]
*  population as much as possible. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=133.24s)]
*  They call it decarcerationism. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, it backfired massively and we're all living with the results of that now in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  San Francisco. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=141.84s)]
*  And, you know, just San Francisco's from all walks of life, it basically rejected that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=142.84s)]
*  agenda. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=146.48s)]
*  But, you know, like I said, the sort of activist wing of the Democratic Party is still deeply [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=147.48s)]
*  invested in it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=151.84s)]
*  And it's going to take a lot more than one election to get them to reject it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=152.84s)]
*  And so, you know, this sort of playbook here is going to have to be replicated across the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  country. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=160.32s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=161.32s)]
*  So you honestly don't and you follow this closely. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=162.32s)]
*  If they lose in San Francisco, that's not a clear enough message for them? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=165.3s)]
*  Well, you know, I think you've got these sort of decarceral prosecutors who've been elected [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=169.22s)]
*  in L.A. and Chicago, New York City, Austin, Philadelphia. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=174.62s)]
*  You know, they're backed by very deep pocketed sort of Wook billionaires, Soros, Reed Hastings [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=180.62s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  They're not going to change their minds just based on one election. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  So they may change their messaging, but I don't think they're going to change their minds. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  It's going to take effort in many of these cities to try and see, to try and make a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=192.38s)]
*  change. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=198.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to take democracy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=199.14s)]
*  Amen. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=200.82s)]
*  David Sacks, congratulations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=201.82s)]
*  You really have helped make that city better. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=204.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=205.98s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJ8EwNPmEI&t=206.98s)]
