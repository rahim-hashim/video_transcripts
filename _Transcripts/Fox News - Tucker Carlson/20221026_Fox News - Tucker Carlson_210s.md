# Tulsi Gabbard: This is exactly why I left the warmongering Democratic Party
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE)
*  Chelsea Gabbard is a former presidential candidate, ran as a Democrat, joins us tonight to assess. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for coming on. So here you had the progressives in the party, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=6.24s)]
*  the liberals acting like liberals have acted for like 100 years and saying maybe we should, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  and I want to say I agree with him completely, we should try to get a peace forged before we all die [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=15.84s)]
*  and then they have to retract it? Why? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=21.36s)]
*  Yeah, you're exactly right, Tucker. These so-called progressives did a very simple thing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=23.36s)]
*  that apparently can appear to be brave in Washington these days. In that letter to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=30.88s)]
*  President Biden, they just told the truth about how this ongoing proxy war with Russia is increasing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  in cost and consequences, both on the Ukrainian people, but also the American people here at home [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=42.08s)]
*  and how it's negatively impacting gas prices, increasing inflation and so on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  You know, these progressives in the letter, they didn't say stop sending aid to Ukraine. Now, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=52.72s)]
*  all they said was, hey, President Biden, engage in diplomacy. And the response they got, of course, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  from the warmongers who control the Democrat Party in Washington was to immediately be smashed to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=62.64s)]
*  pieces so much so that these Democrat members of Congress cowered in the corner with fear and now [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=69.28s)]
*  have gone so far out of their way apologizing profusely for having the audacity to call for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=76.4s)]
*  diplomacy in this war that's putting us all at risk. And now they've actually gone 180 degrees [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  in the opposite direction. They're now trying to prove how much of a warmongers they too are by [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  saying, no, don't engage in diplomacy. We don't want you to do that. This is exactly, Tucker, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=93.12s)]
*  one of the main reasons I left the Democrat Party. They are completely controlled by these [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=100.56s)]
*  warmongers in Washington. They don't really care about the Ukrainian people. Otherwise, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=104.32s)]
*  they would have engaged in diplomacy many, many months ago. They don't really care about the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=108.08s)]
*  American people who are struggling just to make ends meet, struggling with inflation, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=112.16s)]
*  struggling with increasing costs of just about everything. And it just shows who they are [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=117.28s)]
*  subservient to, the military industrial complex and the war hawks in the Democrat Party and the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  mainstream media. I mean, that's why they basically kicked you out of the party because you said, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  well, maybe we shouldn't bomb all the Christians in Syria. Maybe there's another way. No, that was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=132.48s)]
*  like, this is their red line. It's war. Why is that? And did you know that when you went into [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=136.88s)]
*  Congress? No, the Democrats that I saw, the Democrats leaders that I saw were people who [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=142.56s)]
*  took a stand for peace, who people like my former boss, Senator Akaka from Hawaii, he had served [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=152.88s)]
*  during World War II. He understood the cost of war, to see how so completely, where even these [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=158.88s)]
*  so-called progressives, you know, they claimed in the past, at least, to be the champions for peace, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=164.32s)]
*  to be people who understood that in order to be prosperous and free, we must be at peace. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=169.04s)]
*  Now, that's still true. We still cannot achieve prosperity and freedom unless we have peace. But [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=175.6s)]
*  now everyone in the Democrat Party and the leadership in Washington is walking in lockstep [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=181.04s)]
*  as war hawks, no one daring to even step outside the line and say, hey, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=186.48s)]
*  diplomacy, let's exercise diplomacy. What cowards, what cowards they are. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=191.28s)]
*  Joseph Gabbard, I appreciate you coming on as always. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X930NjgdnTE&t=195.67999999999998s)]
