# Tucker: America is eliminating freedom here at home
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM)
*  Even the search engine DuckDuckGo, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=0.0s)]
*  which you may use because they promised you [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=2.0s)]
*  that they would not use algorithms [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=3.88s)]
*  to suppress your speech or track your searches online, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=5.92s)]
*  has joined the herd. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=10.08s)]
*  DuckDuckGo's CEO is promising [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=11.6s)]
*  that the search engine will downrank sites [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=13.24s)]
*  that are, quote, associated with Russian disinformation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=15.16s)]
*  Associated with, okay. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=17.8s)]
*  In other words, saying things [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=20.12s)]
*  that Biden administration doesn't like. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=20.96s)]
*  YouTube has just removed an episode [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=22.7s)]
*  of the Full Send podcast featuring Donald Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  They got five million views in 24 hours, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=27.08s)]
*  but they couldn't handle it, so they hid it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Blake Masters is the CEO of Teal Capital. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=33.62s)]
*  He's running for Senate in the state of Arizona. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=35.86s)]
*  We're happy to have him join us now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=37.56s)]
*  Blake Masters, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  So in the name of protecting freedom, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=41.2s)]
*  we seem to be eliminating it here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=44.12s)]
*  Have you noticed this? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=46.76s)]
*  I've noticed, Tucker. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  A lot of people here in Arizona have noticed, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=49.82s)]
*  and it's just so absurd. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=51.62s)]
*  I mean, DuckDuckGo is supposed to be [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=53.08s)]
*  the free speech search engine, right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=55.74s)]
*  That's its entire point. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  But now they've decided to censor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  Whatever they say is disinformation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  And sorry, but that makes them no better than Google. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=63.74s)]
*  Just another ideological tech company [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  that wants to censor and manipulate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=68.86s)]
*  I mean, what a joke. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=70.94s)]
*  Well, it's especially distressing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=72.38s)]
*  because a lot of us use DuckDuckGo, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  which is of course inferior to Google. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=75.18s)]
*  Google has a great product. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=76.68s)]
*  That's why it's so big. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=77.9s)]
*  And so they've misused that power for evil. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=78.98s)]
*  So is there an option? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=82.78s)]
*  I mean, you're a tech guy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=84.30000000000001s)]
*  Is there some search engine you can go to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=85.3s)]
*  that doesn't have its fingers secretly [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=87.66s)]
*  on the facts feeding in propaganda? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=90.22s)]
*  Well, we're running out of options. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=93.1s)]
*  I mean, I do recommend the Brave browser [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=94.5s)]
*  and the Brave search engine now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  I think we can acknowledge that, yeah, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=99.2s)]
*  propaganda exists, misinformation exists, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=100.84s)]
*  lies exist, and those are bad. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=103.38s)]
*  And remember, Tucker, the vast majority of Democrats [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=105.16s)]
*  in this country believe that Russians hacked voting machines [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=108.5s)]
*  in 2016 to elect Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=112.22s)]
*  I mean, that's just delusional, of course, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=114.16s)]
*  but what a propaganda coup. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=115.52s)]
*  That is the biggest Russian disinformation story [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=116.96s)]
*  of our time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=121.52s)]
*  You don't fight that by becoming more like Russia, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=122.34s)]
*  You don't stop that by having censors [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=125.6s)]
*  tell us what we're allowed to think. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=127.88s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=129.84s)]
*  And by the way, maybe I missed it, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=130.72s)]
*  but I haven't seen really any Russian disinformation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  or Russian news source, anything from Russia [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=134.44s)]
*  or its agents in this country in a very long time, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=136.76s)]
*  all the misinformation propaganda I see [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=139.32s)]
*  comes from the White House. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=141.26s)]
*  Have you noticed? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  There's an awful lot coming from the White House. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=144.4s)]
*  And of course, big tech's got its hook into the White House, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=146.04s)]
*  right? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=148.16s)]
*  It's hard to know where the White House stops [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=149.0s)]
*  and where big tech starts. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=150.82s)]
*  And that's why we can't trust big tech to police itself, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=152.46s)]
*  right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=155.46s)]
*  You can't rely on big tech to check big tech. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=156.3s)]
*  And you can't just say, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=158.3s)]
*  well, build your own alternative, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=159.14s)]
*  Because these companies, when they get big and successful, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=161.32s)]
*  they all succumb to the same pressures. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=164.12s)]
*  And you mentioned that YouTube, just yesterday, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=166.64s)]
*  they ripped off President Trump's interview [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=168.92s)]
*  with the Nelk boys. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=170.96s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=172.84s)]
*  This is a highly successful interview [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=174.14s)]
*  with the former president of the United States. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  Like, my gosh. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=177.18s)]
*  And they just decided to censor it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=178.02s)]
*  And Google, Tucker, I will say Google is the worst offender. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=179.62s)]
*  Google, of course, owns YouTube. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=182.22s)]
*  But Google has the power to swing a presidential election. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=183.76s)]
*  And for all we know, that's exactly what they did in 2020. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=187.7s)]
*  Well, I don't think there's any question about that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=190.54s)]
*  And to topple governments around the world. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=192.5s)]
*  Blake Masters from Arizona, 21st Senate, appreciate it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=195.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM&t=199.74s)]
