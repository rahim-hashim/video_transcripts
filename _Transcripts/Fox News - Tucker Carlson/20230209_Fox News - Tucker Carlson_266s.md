# Tucker: Airbnb goes full North Korea
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM)
*  Lauren Southern is an author and a filmmaker, and some of her views are considered offensive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=0.0s)]
*  by the neoliberals in charge of everything. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=6.04s)]
*  For example, she thinks unrestricted illegal immigration probably not that good for your [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=7.72s)]
*  country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=11.16s)]
*  And because of that, Big Tech has decided to make it impossible for her to live in the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=12.16s)]
*  West. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=16.4s)]
*  Airbnb has refused to allow her to stay in any of its properties without explaining why. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  By the way, if you have a felony record, you could probably stay at an Airbnb. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=22.04s)]
*  But now Airbnb has decided to take a close look at Lauren Southern's family. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=27.16s)]
*  Because her parents are related to her by blood, the genetics are incriminating, and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=32.06s)]
*  her parents are no longer allowed to stay at Airbnb, a common practice in North Korea. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=37.92s)]
*  So we reached out to Airbnb and its head of public policy, former Obama official Jay Carney, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=43.2s)]
*  and Airbnb claimed this was just a mistake. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=48.0s)]
*  But of course, it wasn't a mistake because they explained that they were doing it because [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=50.08s)]
*  these people are close to Lauren Southern in their email. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=55.66s)]
*  This is the company, by the way, that banned January 6th defendants. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=58.739999999999995s)]
*  Lauren Southern remains banned by Airbnb. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  She joins us today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=65.3s)]
*  Lauren, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=66.3s)]
*  So, I mean, what kind of world is it where not just the thought criminal, but the thought [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=68.42s)]
*  criminal's family is banned from spending the night? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=74.3s)]
*  What is that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=77.46s)]
*  There's definitely been a Pandora's box opened in the culture war. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=80.22s)]
*  I think progressives have realized with the laws we have in place defending civil liberties, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=84.06s)]
*  they can't quite bring a social credit system in yet. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=89.22s)]
*  So they found a way to circumvent it through the corporate class. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=91.94s)]
*  They can just impose a social credit system on us using big tech. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=97.98s)]
*  Do you think your parents will be allowed to buy food or receive medical care since [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=102.7s)]
*  you're against illegal immigration? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=106.7s)]
*  In the next few years, who knows, honestly, this is escalating at such a rate I never [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=111.34s)]
*  could have expected. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  Of course, Airbnb have reversed their decision for now, claiming they are very sorry. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  But I think we both know the only thing they're sorry for is bad PR and that they were trending [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  on Twitter last night. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=127.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, and they admitted it in their communication to your parents. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=128.58s)]
*  They said your connection to Lauren Southern makes you ineligible. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=132.82s)]
*  So I wonder if you were like a convicted armed robber, would they do this to your parents? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=136.38s)]
*  Of course, they would not even consider it, right? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=142.34s)]
*  They don't even treat the families of Epstein and Maxwell like this, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=146.5s)]
*  And what was funny is when they reversed the decision, they claimed in an email to my parents [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=150.5s)]
*  that they had reviewed their appeal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  My parents never appealed the decision. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=158.22s)]
*  So they're attempting to create this phony narrative that it was all a mistake. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=160.3s)]
*  How do you mistakenly track down an activist's family, mistakenly send them a specific email [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=164.6s)]
*  saying it is because of their relation to me? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=169.76s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=172.56s)]
*  They're trying to cover up something nefarious here. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=173.64s)]
*  And the only reason they aren't continuing to do this to me is because I have a platform [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=176.28s)]
*  and they're testing the waters. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=180.92s)]
*  If they got away with it this time, they would have kept going. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  But they miscalculated how woke their market is. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=185.42s)]
*  This shouldn't surprise us. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=188.88s)]
*  These are the same people who attack entire groups of people on the basis of their genetics. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=190.08s)]
*  Some groups are innocent, some are guilty. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  It's classic Nazi race science. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  You're implicated by your blood. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  That's what Airbnb is saying. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  Essentially, yes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=202.96s)]
*  And I got to say, one of the most disappointing things for me is that it has gotten to this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=206.28s)]
*  point that we've spent so many years having Republicans defend cronyism by pretending [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=210.8s)]
*  it is capitalism and then our failsafe, which was supposed to be progressives who are supposed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  to question the big corporations when they are discriminatory, specifically on blood [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=221.56s)]
*  and genetics. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=225.68s)]
*  They're like an ADHD dog that just got distracted by a bone with a pride flag on it and placated [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=227.24s)]
*  entirely. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=232.24s)]
*  So we're left with just activists on Twitter. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=233.24s)]
*  Thank goodness, your show, you're really holding down the fort for conservatives who want to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=235.44s)]
*  have their freedoms. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=239.96s)]
*  But it's just a real shame. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=241.12s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's not hard. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  We shouldn't punish people's parents for thought crimes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=246.8s)]
*  I mean, it's like, yeah, that seems an easy one. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=250.28s)]
*  Lauren Southern, great to see you tonight. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVUEUJxXxEM&t=252.92000000000002s)]
