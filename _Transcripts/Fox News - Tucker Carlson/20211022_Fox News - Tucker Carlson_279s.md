# Ron DeSantis: Florida is ready to help
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 22, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI)
*  Well, pretty much since the day Joe Biden got inaugurated, you've been hearing in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=0.0s)]
*  media every day that the state of Florida is a COVID hotspot. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Virtually every person in the state has died of the coronavirus. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=11.16s)]
*  But suddenly you're not hearing that anymore. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=14.64s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=16.64s)]
*  Well, because the numbers are too stark to deny. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=17.64s)]
*  In the last seven days, Florida has averaged fewer COVID cases per capita than virtually [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=20.54s)]
*  any other state in the United States. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=25.84s)]
*  Ranks 48 out of 50. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=27.48s)]
*  Now the governor of the state, Ron DeSantis, has announced a special legislative session [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=30.28s)]
*  to ban COVID-19 related vaccine mandates, not just by the state, but by businesses throughout [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=33.96s)]
*  the state of Florida. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=39.84s)]
*  The governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, joins us now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=40.84s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=43.24s)]
*  So if you would, explain what this would mean and why you're doing it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=45.64s)]
*  Tucker, over more than anything, this is an individual choice. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Your livelihood should not be dependent on whether you get a COVID shot, much less in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=56.88s)]
*  the future if these mandates take hold, whether you get your yearly booster or booster every [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=60.8s)]
*  six months or whatever they're going to make you do. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=65.16s)]
*  This is a personal decision. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=67.68s)]
*  Number two, what Biden's doing is unconstitutional and we have a responsibility as a state to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=69.38s)]
*  fight back against federal overreach. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=74.62s)]
*  But then number three, this is not good for the economy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=76.52s)]
*  This is just bad policy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=79.64s)]
*  You have a lot of businesses that actually need people, particularly in health care, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=81.44s)]
*  to do this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=87.2s)]
*  And what, you're going to give people walking papers in the middle of this? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=88.2s)]
*  So I think it's bad all around. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=89.6s)]
*  And I think that, yes, we're going to be doing litigation against the Biden administration, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=91.32s)]
*  which is important, but we also need to do legislation to provide protections for folks [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=95.6s)]
*  in Florida. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  And I'll tell you, Tucker, yes, Biden's doing mandates. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  And I disagree with that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=103.78s)]
*  I think we all do. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=104.78s)]
*  But there are businesses that are doing this on their own, even apart from the mandates. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=106.2s)]
*  And these are employees of theirs that have been working throughout this whole pandemic. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=111.36s)]
*  And now they're being told, you get your walking papers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=115.6s)]
*  That is not a free choice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=118.52s)]
*  You know, Tucker, we had a nurse today at our event. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=119.52s)]
*  She has already had COVID and she's pregnant right now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=123.0s)]
*  And so she says, I think this is something that I don't want to do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=126.52s)]
*  How is that something that you're going to deprive her of a right to make a living based [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=129.8s)]
*  on that very reasonable decision? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=134.12s)]
*  So the White House is very focused on you and on your state. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=137.28s)]
*  And this is the centerpiece of their domestic agenda, vaccine mandates. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=140.88s)]
*  This is the whole thing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=143.84s)]
*  It's what they care about most. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=144.84s)]
*  So if you openly defy them, I mean, are you expecting them to hit back, try to choke off [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=145.84s)]
*  federal health care money to the state? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=151.32s)]
*  Or do you expect some kind of confrontation with the Biden administration? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm sure they're going to do whatever they can. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=156.36s)]
*  Ken Tucker, over the summer, when we had Delta hit, I started a monoclonal antibody program [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=159.52s)]
*  because people were being admitted to the hospital without getting early treatment. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=164.56s)]
*  So since we put that program in, our daily admissions have gone down about 90 percent. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, as we were doing that, Biden tried to cut off the supply to Florida because this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  was working. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  And so I imagine they're definitely going to do something to try to hit back. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=178.68s)]
*  But at the end of the day, do you think people do you want to protect people's jobs or do [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=182.56s)]
*  you not? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  And I'm going to be on the side of protecting people's jobs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  And if Joe Biden wants to be on the side of causing people to lose their job, well, then [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  we'll let him do that and we'll fight the good fight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because he knows more about medicine than nurses and doctors. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=198.08s)]
*  So the supply chain crisis is a real crisis. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=201.12s)]
*  I think a year ago it cost three grand to move a container from Asia to the East Coast. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  The United States is now 20 grand. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=210.48s)]
*  So this is affecting every part of the U.S. economy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  You say you have a solution or a part solution to this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=218.04s)]
*  So we have capacity at all of our ports. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=220.04s)]
*  Remember, Tucker, they made a big deal about L.A. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=222.56s)]
*  going to start doing 24-7. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=224.56s)]
*  We always do 24-7 in Florida. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  We've got capacity and all of our ports can offer these businesses good incentives that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  they reroute their ships. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=232.56s)]
*  We've already had some ships rerouted. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=233.76s)]
*  We expect to have more. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=236.2s)]
*  But if you're going to sit off the coast for days on end, you might as well just bring [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=237.6s)]
*  it to Florida. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  We've got great logistics on the ground that can get it to market. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  And we're happy to be able to step up because there are empty shelves. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=245.16s)]
*  This is driving inflation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=249.32s)]
*  This is going to cause shortages. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=250.76s)]
*  We already see shortages. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=252.16s)]
*  It's going to affect the Christmas season. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=253.28s)]
*  So I think Florida can be part of the solution here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  The more Florida acts like a country right now, I think the better for all of us, my [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=258.32s)]
*  personal view. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=261.32s)]
*  Governor Andres Santos, I appreciate your coming on. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrOyAzBR0tI&t=262.32s)]
