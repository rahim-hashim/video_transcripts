# Miranda Devine shares stunning new details about Hunter Biden’s ‘FBI mole’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4)
*  Well, as you know, if you've been following this story at all, the FBI has been in possession of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=0.0s)]
*  Hunter Biden's laptop for years now, even as they've arrested over a thousand and a thousand more to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  go, people who walked through the Capitol on January 6th. But in the case of the president's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=11.36s)]
*  son, they've done nothing with it at all, no indictments, even though, as you also know, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=15.44s)]
*  there is evidence of felonies on that laptop. So what is this about? Well, it's possible the FBI [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=19.6s)]
*  is working with Hunter Biden. The New York Post now reporting that Hunter Biden had an FBI mole [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=26.0s)]
*  called One Eye, and this mole tipped off Hunter Biden's Chinese business partners that they were [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=31.76s)]
*  under investigation. That is according to an Israeli energy expert who was arrested last month [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=37.04s)]
*  in Cyprus on gun-running charges. And it looks like he may be innocent. We don't know. Miranda [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=42.72s)]
*  Devine is on this story as it develops. She joins us tonight. So those are the outlines. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=49.52s)]
*  And I apologize if I've misstated them, but will you just kind of sum this up? This is an amazing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=54.96s)]
*  story, it seems like. Look, Takri, it's actually bizarre. I mean, it's another bizarre twist on an [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=59.92s)]
*  already bizarre story about the Biden family and the cast of characters involved in their influence [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=68.48s)]
*  peddling scheme around the world. And Dr. Gal Luft is the latest one. He is an Israeli energy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=74.32s)]
*  expert, a professor. He was arrested in Cyprus, as you said, and is still in a Cyprus jail. He's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=81.44s)]
*  charged, apparently, with gun-running and fara violations and various things. And he claims that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=88.72s)]
*  he is innocent and that he's only been arrested to shut him up about what he knows about the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=96.0s)]
*  Biden family business. And a lot of his story does check out. He is regarded in his orbit in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=101.92s)]
*  Washington, D.C. as, you know, he's well regarded. He's a legitimate energy expert. He's a former [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=110.08s)]
*  high-ranking officer in the Israeli Defense Force. He has multiple degrees. And he also talks about [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=118.8s)]
*  this FBI mole that he claims Hunter Biden used to tip off his Chinese partners that there was [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=128.48s)]
*  an FBI investigation into them. And there is some corroboration of that from the reporting that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=135.84s)]
*  we've already done from the laptop. We know that Hunter Biden did have contacts within the FBI. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=141.12s)]
*  We know that he used them to benefit at least one of his Chinese business partners, Patrick Ho. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=147.44s)]
*  And when Patrick Ho was arrested at JFK by the FBI, Hunter Biden then contacted his FBI contacts. And [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=154.0s)]
*  we don't know what they did for him, but that sort of accords with this story that's coming [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  from Gal Luft. And Gal Luft worked for three years in Washington, D.C. with Hunter Biden's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=169.84s)]
*  Chinese business partners. That checks out too. So when he says that those business partners told [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=176.96s)]
*  him about what the Bidens were up to, the hundreds of thousands of dollars that he knew about that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=184.72s)]
*  was going to Hunter and his uncle Jim Biden every month, and their contact with this FBI mole, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=190.24s)]
*  it does just bolster, I guess, the reporting we've done from the laptop. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=197.28s)]
*  So quickly, this Luft guy, the Israeli energy expert, as he was being arrested, he tweeted and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=203.44s)]
*  said, they're arresting me to shut me up. I have the facts about Hunter Biden. He's a smart guy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=209.76s)]
*  His social media is still up if you want to see it. It confirms he's a very smart person. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=216.88s)]
*  Has he had anything else to say from his jail in Cyprus, do we know? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  Look, through his lawyer, which is the only way I've been able to talk to him, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=226.64s)]
*  he certainly has other allegations, but without documents or other evidence to back it up, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=231.36s)]
*  it's difficult to report those. He did get bail from the Cypriot courts a couple of weeks ago, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=238.4s)]
*  but that has been vigorously opposed by U.S. authorities and I'm told by Gal Luft's lawyer [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=245.6s)]
*  that the ambassador in Cyprus is putting a lot of pressure to keep him in jail. They want to extradite [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=252.96s)]
*  him to the U.S. on these charges of gun running and so on, which really baffle the people in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=259.68s)]
*  Washington who've known Gal Luft for a long time and they say that's not really in his nature. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=265.04s)]
*  He doesn't have the profile of a gun runner. It might be worth a trip to Cyprus. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=272.64s)]
*  No. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=276.64s)]
*  So, Marina Devine, thank you very much. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=276.8s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=280.56s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fph1o2fdql4&t=289.68s)]
