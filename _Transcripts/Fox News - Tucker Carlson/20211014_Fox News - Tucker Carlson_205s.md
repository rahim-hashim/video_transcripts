# Vivek Ramaswamy: This is what's behind Biden's smokescreen
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc)
*  Vivek Ramaswamy is the author of Woke, Inc. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=0.0s)]
*  and a very smart man, he joins us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=2.96s)]
*  So, Vivek, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=5.88s)]
*  Now, your parents came to this country from another country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  One of the things that immigrant families have [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=11.16s)]
*  that native-born Americans don't is an appreciation [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  of the fragility of economies. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  They don't imagine that everyone's gonna be rich [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=18.04s)]
*  for all time just because they were born in a rich country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=20.5s)]
*  And watching these people talk, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=23.64s)]
*  you really feel like that's what they believe. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=26.32s)]
*  This can kind of go on forever. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=28.72s)]
*  We keep printing the money. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=30.2s)]
*  Everyone's got more than enough, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  more drag time story hours. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=33.0s)]
*  Exactly, Tucker. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=35.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, talking about being woke, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  it is the ultimate privilege. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=38.12s)]
*  The reason you don't see wokeness infecting poor countries [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=39.68s)]
*  is that they have bigger things to worry about, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=42.64s)]
*  like people putting food on the dinner table. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=44.0s)]
*  This is the ultimate privilege. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  But now, as the United States goes from being well-off [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  to being less well-off in all the ways you laid out, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=50.4s)]
*  inflation, supply chain shortages, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  watching foreign policy disasters abroad, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  you now see the people who are in power, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=56.8s)]
*  the Biden administration, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=59.32s)]
*  using and projecting these progressive values [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  as a smoke screen to deflect accountability [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=62.24s)]
*  for their actual policy failures. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=64.64s)]
*  So you mark my words, Tucker, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=66.44s)]
*  the more inflation we see, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=67.88s)]
*  the more supply chain shortages we see, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  the more foreign policy disasters we see, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=71.34s)]
*  the more you're gonna see the Biden administration [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=73.48s)]
*  talking about racism or misogyny or bigotry or whatever [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=75.08s)]
*  as a way of changing the subject. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=78.68s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=80.2s)]
*  You saw it in Afghanistan, for example. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=81.72s)]
*  You have the Taliban coming to power. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=83.68s)]
*  You have actual terrorists coming to power [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=84.92s)]
*  in a place that we left just a couple of months ago. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=86.82s)]
*  And yet, the thing that we're actually talking about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=89.13999999999999s)]
*  with Merrick Garland is domestic terrorism [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=90.86s)]
*  in the form of parents who are actually putting up protests [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=92.74s)]
*  to the way their kids are being taught in school. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=95.1s)]
*  Classic example of changing the subject. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=97.02s)]
*  And mark my words, you're gonna see more of it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=99.05999999999999s)]
*  as the policy failures continue to rack up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=100.74s)]
*  You blame the Trotsky records [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=103.13999999999999s)]
*  for the failure of the potato harvest. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=104.74s)]
*  And our Trotsky records are white supremacists. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=106.33999999999999s)]
*  No one's ever seen one, but they're everywhere. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  I do think that's a pretty hard case to make though [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=110.78s)]
*  in the face of increasing poverty. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=113.78s)]
*  Can you actually convince people that they're getting poorer [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=116.18s)]
*  because QAnon is bad? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  So you had this battle on the left, Tucker. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=121.86000000000001s)]
*  Not a lot of people on the right appreciate this distinction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  You've got the Occupy Wall Street left [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  that's mostly been left in the sand for 10 years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=127.5s)]
*  And then you have the new woke left [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=130.78s)]
*  that's actually held the reins over power. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=132.1s)]
*  Now, as you begin to see economic recession [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=134.82s)]
*  and economic consequences in this country, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=136.8s)]
*  as you begin to see inflation, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=138.62s)]
*  as you begin to see gas prices go up, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=139.86s)]
*  I think you're actually gonna see the rise [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=141.94s)]
*  of the Occupy Wall Street left come back [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  and say we on the left need to be going back [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=145.0s)]
*  to arguing about economic inequality [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=147.08s)]
*  as opposed to talking about racism [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=149.12s)]
*  and misogyny and bigotry. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=150.68s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=151.92s)]
*  I think that's gonna be a good thing for the left. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=152.76s)]
*  I think it's gonna be a good thing for this country [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=154.32s)]
*  because that's ultimately what the left and right [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=155.84s)]
*  ought to be arguing about. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=157.52s)]
*  They can have different views on redistribution [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=158.56s)]
*  or taxation policy or what the right economic policies are, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=160.8s)]
*  but that is what we need to be talking about. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=163.76s)]
*  We need to be talking about our reliance on China, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=165.44s)]
*  which isn't a left-wing issue or a right-wing issue. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=167.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=169.52s)]
*  Both parties, frankly, are guilty for it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=170.36s)]
*  for the last 30 years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=171.4s)]
*  So I think this could actually in the long run [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=172.32s)]
*  be good for the country, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=173.84s)]
*  getting us back on topic, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=174.88s)]
*  talking about the things we need to be talking about [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=176.28s)]
*  as opposed to the woke smoke that the Biden administration [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=178.04s)]
*  and their corporate cronies blow every day [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=180.32s)]
*  to change the subject. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=182.04s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, this is serious country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=184.44s)]
*  It's a great country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=186.0s)]
*  It deserves a serious conversation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=186.84s)]
*  We haven't had one for years. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=188.12s)]
*  And I appreciate you're saying that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=189.64s)]
*  Vivek, thank you so much. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvxJ2XMRJZc&t=191.28s)]
