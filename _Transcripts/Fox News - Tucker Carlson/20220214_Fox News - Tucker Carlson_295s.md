# Tucker: Trudeau has declared Canada a dictatorship
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs)
*  When thousands of blue-collar workers showed up in Ottawa several weeks ago to protest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=0.0s)]
*  the tyranny being imposed against them, the Prime Minister of Canada refused to meet with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=5.68s)]
*  them or to speak to them. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Instead, he fled the city. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=11.64s)]
*  And then, from his bunker, he called the truckers Nazis. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=13.52s)]
*  When they still didn't leave the city, Justin Trudeau suspended democracy and declared Canada [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=17.44s)]
*  a dictatorship. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=22.44s)]
*  The federal government has invoked the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=24.28s)]
*  capacity to address the blockades and occupations. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=31.96s)]
*  The Emergencies Act will be used to strengthen and support law enforcement agencies at all [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  levels across the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=42.88s)]
*  This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting people's jobs, and restoring confidence [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=45.84s)]
*  in our institutions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=53.34s)]
*  So let's be clear. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=56.5s)]
*  This is a defining moment in the history of Canada, in the history of the English-speaking [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=57.540000000000006s)]
*  West. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=62.5s)]
*  The Emergencies Act is martial law. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=63.5s)]
*  It has never been invoked in the history of that country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=65.94s)]
*  Now, by law, the Emergencies Act is allowed only in emergencies, in, quote, urgent and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=69.78s)]
*  critical situations that seriously endanger the lives, health, or safety of Canadians. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  What's happening now does not qualify. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  What's happening in Canada now is not an emergency. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=83.26s)]
*  Here's what it looked like this weekend. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=85.98s)]
*  According to Justin Trudeau, everyone you saw in that tape is a terrorist, even the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=112.94s)]
*  kids in their bouncy castles. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=118.02s)]
*  Justin Trudeau has unilaterally revoked their civil liberties and authorized men with automatic [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=120.06s)]
*  weapons to haul them to jail. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=125.5s)]
*  Trudeau was allowed for the rest of this man, for example, making food for the terrorists. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=128.1s)]
*  You can receive a free meal, irregardless of what faith you're from, what caste, creed, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=133.02s)]
*  religion, doesn't matter. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=138.18s)]
*  It's about the community kitchen. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=139.86s)]
*  We all eat as one and humanity's equal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=141.9s)]
*  So the seva concept, helping the community, is what we're practicing here today. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=144.94000000000003s)]
*  We're here alongside the truckers in the fight for freedom, and we're doing our part from [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=150.5s)]
*  the Sikh faith. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=155.06s)]
*  So again, all of these people can now be arrested on site simply because of where they're standing, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=157.86s)]
*  but being arrested is the least of their problems. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  An arrest suggests bail. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=165.74s)]
*  You can get out of jail. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=167.46s)]
*  You can't get out of the country Justin Trudeau has just made. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=169.22s)]
*  Under martial law, Trudeau now has the power to force banks to seize their bank accounts [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=173.34s)]
*  and insurance companies to cancel their insurance. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=178.34s)]
*  That means they can't actually live in Canada anymore. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=181.26s)]
*  They are non-persons. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=183.46s)]
*  They're enemies of the state, and they will be crushed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=184.46s)]
*  At least one trucker knows exactly what's coming. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=188.1s)]
*  He has seen him before. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=190.1s)]
*  He came to Canada from Nicolae Ceaușescu's Romania. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=191.38s)]
*  Why did only people meant to vote? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=194.9s)]
*  Why 100 people, 180 or 200 people to decide your life, or my or another? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=199.7s)]
*  Let the Canadian people do it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=205.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=208.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=209.26s)]
*  No. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=210.26s)]
*  It's all corrupt too, all those people voting. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=211.26s)]
*  It's hard man, when some people they decide your life. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=214.26s)]
*  Like 300 people they decide your life when you are 30 million. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=218.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=221.7s)]
*  Let us vote. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=222.7s)]
*  So it is an overstatement to compare what is happening in Canada right now to what happens [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=225.58s)]
*  in a Stalinist dictatorship. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=229.5s)]
*  Well, the slogans are different. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=230.5s)]
*  In the Eastern Bloc they used to talk about solidarity. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=232.38000000000002s)]
*  In Canada they talk about diversity. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=234.5s)]
*  But the repression is similar. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=237.24s)]
*  Today Canada's Deputy Prime Minister, by the way, is a former American journalist, maybe [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=240.3s)]
*  not surprisingly, announced that going forward Justin Trudeau will regulate all crowdfunding [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=244.3s)]
*  and cryptocurrency under the Terrorist Financing Act. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=250.46s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=254.38000000000002s)]
*  So Justin Trudeau is now in charge of all of your finances. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=255.38s)]
*  He's in charge of cryptocurrency? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=259.58s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=260.58s)]
*  And on what justification? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=261.58s)]
*  And if that wasn't clear enough, Trudeau's minority government unilaterally just sent [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=262.58s)]
*  another half a billion dollars to the authoritarian state of Ukraine, where the head of the rival [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=267.74s)]
*  political party is now under arrest and where opposition media has been banned. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=274.38s)]
*  That's the country they're now in solidarity with. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=279.62s)]
*  You can see where this is going. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=282.18s)]
*  In fact, it's already there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=283.18s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZzJPXojtWs&t=284.98s)]
