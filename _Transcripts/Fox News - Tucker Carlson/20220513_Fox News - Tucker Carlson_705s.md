# Tucker: They are hoarding baby formula
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, happy Friday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=2.92s)]
*  At a press conference back on March 24th of this year, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=4.24s)]
*  Joe Biden announced that thanks to the regime change war [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=7.36s)]
*  he's decided to voluntarily wage in Eastern Europe, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  our country, the United States, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=13.32s)]
*  will soon face food shortages. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=14.52s)]
*  Food shortages are quote, gonna be real, Biden said. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=16.4s)]
*  Now the reporters in the room dutifully transcribed [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=20.6s)]
*  the words and wrote their stories, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=22.56s)]
*  but you may have missed it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=23.96s)]
*  You may not have even heard this [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  because there weren't a lot of follow-up pieces [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=26.52s)]
*  about these manmade food shortages [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=28.36s)]
*  that Joe Biden was predicting. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=30.56s)]
*  And that's weird if you think about it [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=31.88s)]
*  because food shortages are inherently a big deal. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=33.88s)]
*  You could argue they're even more significant [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=37.6s)]
*  than say a slap fight between actors at an award ceremony. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=39.24s)]
*  Food shortages are historic events. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=43.16s)]
*  They overturn societies. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=45.8s)]
*  They bring down empires. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=47.08s)]
*  They often have. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=48.28s)]
*  If you've got food shortages, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  you've got a potentially destabilizing problem on your hands. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=51.0s)]
*  And now we do have food shortages. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=54.64s)]
*  They're real, as Joe Biden predicted. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  As of tonight, at least 26 states are reporting [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=58.16s)]
*  that half their retail stores [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=60.64s)]
*  are completely out of baby formula. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=62.16s)]
*  That would include the states of Texas, Tennessee, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=64.0s)]
*  Missouri, and Iowa, and many others. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=65.72s)]
*  So these are major population centers [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=67.6s)]
*  without enough food for newborns. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  In Memphis and Nashville, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=72.16s)]
*  52% of stores have no baby formula. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  Houston and Des Moines are reporting similar shortages. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=76.72s)]
*  In St. Antonio, a city with an unusually high percentage [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  of families with small children, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=82.64s)]
*  57% of all stores in the city have no baby formula. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=84.44s)]
*  Those are the numbers. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  Journalist Savannah Hernandez went to see for herself [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  what the reality looks like. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  She went to eight different stores in Texas, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=94.6s)]
*  and not a single one of them had any baby formula to sell. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  We talked to a couple moms outside [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=101.88s)]
*  who said that they've been having a really hard time [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=103.35999999999999s)]
*  finding formula, and so this is what we're seeing right now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  The second target that we've been to, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  we first went to a target in Louisville, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  and now we're in Frisco. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=112.16s)]
*  And as you guys can see, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=113.64s)]
*  it's pretty much the exact same thing here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=114.72s)]
*  Grocery stores pretty much empty, no formula to be found. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  I've talked to a couple moms who were telling me [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  that people have spent upwards of $150 on a formula [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  on Amazon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  Some moms can't even find the formula [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=127.44s)]
*  that their baby requires. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=129.24s)]
*  One mother telling me her child was constipated, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=131.0s)]
*  needed a specific type of formula, couldn't find it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=133.12s)]
*  So that's what's going on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=135.32s)]
*  So that's real. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=138.32s)]
*  You may not like Savannah Hernandez's politics, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  but she's got a video camera inside Target [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=141.96s)]
*  and they don't have any baby formula. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=144.44s)]
*  So babies need to eat, but they can't. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  Is that a big problem? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=149.16s)]
*  Well, yes, it's a big problem. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=150.44s)]
*  How big? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=151.72s)]
*  We have a lot of problems right now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=152.56s)]
*  Ask yourself, is this a bigger problem than, say, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  using the wrong pronoun? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=155.96s)]
*  Or Trump voters peacefully trespassing in a public building? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=157.68s)]
*  It seems like a bigger problem than that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=161.44s)]
*  So you would think the Biden administration [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=163.16s)]
*  would do something about it, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=164.8s)]
*  and they certainly could if they wanted to. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  They could do anything. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  These are the people who claim to have the power [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  to control global weather systems, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=171.8s)]
*  the power to bend human biology to their will. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  So nothing is beyond the scope of their powers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  And yet in this particular case, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=180.68s)]
*  Joe Biden is in no hurry to fix the problem. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  In fact, he joked about it today. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=186.96s)]
*  If we'd been better mind readers, I guess we could have, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=189.24s)]
*  but we moved as quickly as a problem became apparent to us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=191.68s)]
*  Well, if we'd been better mind readers, get it? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=195.68s)]
*  It's hilarious because actually nobody can read minds. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=199.0s)]
*  Joe Biden's being sarcastic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=203.44s)]
*  like your 14-year-old daughter. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=205.08s)]
*  Lay off, dad, it's not my fault. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=206.16s)]
*  Okay, so Joe Biden does not read minds, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=208.72s)]
*  but the question is, does anyone in the White House [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=210.56s)]
*  read newspapers or watch television news? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=212.16s)]
*  Supplies of baby formula were down at least 20% [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=215.08s)]
*  as far back as January. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=218.04s)]
*  That was not hidden knowledge, it was public knowledge. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=220.0s)]
*  It was out there, if you were looking. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=222.4s)]
*  Here's one representative headline [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=225.2s)]
*  from the Fox affiliate in West Virginia, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=226.6s)]
*  WVNS, back in February. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=228.56s)]
*  What the baby formula shortage means for parents. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=231.16s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=235.64s)]
*  Americans were worried about not having enough baby formula. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=236.48s)]
*  There was a shortage in February, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=239.2s)]
*  but the White House wasn't concerned. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=243.44s)]
*  And they knew, we know that for certain [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=244.6s)]
*  because Brian Deese, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=246.24s)]
*  who's the director of the White House Economic Council, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=247.72s)]
*  just admitted that he knew on CNN. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=249.72s)]
*  We were aware back in February, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=252.0s)]
*  and we've had a team on this from the FDA [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=253.92s)]
*  and interagency process since then. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=256.04s)]
*  Okay, so Joe Biden has been on this problem since February. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=259.64000000000004s)]
*  So why is it still a problem? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=263.36s)]
*  Why is it still impossible to buy baby formula [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=264.72s)]
*  in stores in San Antonio tonight? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=267.04s)]
*  Well, the White House has an answer for that too. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  And the answer is, greedy mothers. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=271.36s)]
*  They're the problem. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  Like Kulaks hiding grain, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  counter-revolutionary moms in this country [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=277.72s)]
*  are undermining America's baby formula supply. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=279.72s)]
*  They're quote, hoarding baby formula. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=283.4s)]
*  Watch Joe Biden's flack explain. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=286.52s)]
*  But if you are a parent [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=290.0s)]
*  who's looking for formula right now, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=291.28s)]
*  struggling to find what you need, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=292.84s)]
*  you have even a rough guess [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  of how long these shortages are going to last. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=296.4s)]
*  What should parents be bracing for here? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, we've already seen an increase in supply [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=300.56s)]
*  over the past couple of weeks. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=302.28s)]
*  What we are seeing, which is an enormous problem, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=303.64s)]
*  is hoarding. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=305.67999999999995s)]
*  People hoarding because they're fearful. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=307.0s)]
*  That is one element of it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=309.12s)]
*  And people hoarding because they are trying to profit [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  off of fearful parents. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=312.68s)]
*  Oh, now we're down to Zimbabwean economics. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=314.92s)]
*  We don't have enough to eat [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=320.0s)]
*  because greedy people are hoarding it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=321.16s)]
*  It's your fault, America's moms. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=322.92s)]
*  You and your pig-ish little babies, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=325.56s)]
*  always thoughtlessly eating, eating, eating, eating. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=327.68s)]
*  Show some patriotic restraint [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=330.4s)]
*  and stop buying so much food for your kids, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=332.0s)]
*  you greedy wreckers. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=334.64s)]
*  That's the White House position [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=337.64s)]
*  on the baby formula shortage. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=338.56s)]
*  In fact, and it's possible this will not surprise you, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=340.88s)]
*  the reality is just the opposite of what you heard. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  America's moms are not hoarding baby formula [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  because they're greedy [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=351.12s)]
*  or their fat little babies are eating too much. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=352.44s)]
*  Sorry, Jen Psaki. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=354.64s)]
*  The Biden administration is hoarding baby formula. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=356.96s)]
*  The administration's WIC program, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=359.88s)]
*  formerly known as Special Supplemental Nutrition Program [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  for Women, Infants, and Children, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=364.28s)]
*  is by far the largest purchaser of baby formula [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=365.52s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  That is true no matter what they're telling you [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=369.2s)]
*  from the podium at the White House. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=370.96s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=372.0s)]
*  States award a contract to a baby formula manufacturer [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=373.44s)]
*  to provide the product to WIC participants. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=376.44s)]
*  Then people who receive WIC benefits [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=379.08s)]
*  take a voucher to the store [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=380.92s)]
*  and buy the baby formula from that manufacturer. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=382.56s)]
*  Now government agencies get a kickback [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=385.48s)]
*  from the manufacturer in the form of a rebate, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  sometimes as high as 85% of the wholesale price. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=389.12s)]
*  In other words, the baby formula manufacturer [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=391.76s)]
*  essentially pays the government to maintain this monopoly. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=393.8s)]
*  And it's good business for everybody. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=397.48s)]
*  It's been going on for a long time. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=398.64s)]
*  The problem right now is that the Abbott Nutrition Company [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=400.4s)]
*  has made the baby formula [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=404.62s)]
*  for the vast majority of WIC contracts. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=405.86s)]
*  The government had all its eggs virtually in Abbott's basket. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=408.64s)]
*  Unfortunately, Abbott just closed its plant [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  in Sturgis, Michigan because of contamination. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  And that means that millions of people [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  who used WIC to buy Abbott products [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=418.24s)]
*  are forced to buy competing formulas [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=420.52s)]
*  and they're doing it all at once. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=422.58s)]
*  So a government monopoly overseen by Joe Biden [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=425.56s)]
*  caused this baby formula crisis. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=429.32s)]
*  So what's the government doing to fix it? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=431.8s)]
*  Well, here's what they're not doing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=434.18s)]
*  They're not invoking the Defense Production Act [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=435.56s)]
*  to manufacture more baby formula. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=437.44s)]
*  Of course not, that's for Ukrainians only. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=438.88s)]
*  Shut up, American moms. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=440.72s)]
*  Instead, the Biden administration is doing the opposite, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=442.8s)]
*  which is to say doing the unimaginable. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=444.88s)]
*  They're shipping scarce baby formula [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=447.36s)]
*  to the southern border to benefit illegal aliens [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=449.62s)]
*  who have the right to be here in the first place. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=452.08s)]
*  Now we know this because of a Florida congressman [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=454.12s)]
*  called Kat Kamak, here's the video. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  This got sent to me by a border patrol agent this morning [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  and said, this is disgusting, you will not believe this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=463.32s)]
*  They're receiving pallets and more pallets [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=467.32s)]
*  of baby formula at the border. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=471.38s)]
*  This was taken at Ursula processing facility [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  where thousands are being housed and processed [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=478.96s)]
*  and then released subsequently into the United States. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=482.76s)]
*  So think about this, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=486.2s)]
*  this is what America last looks like. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=488.2s)]
*  That's real, by the way. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=492.88s)]
*  The administration does not deny that it's real. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=494.56s)]
*  Congressman Kamak also uploaded these two pictures [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=496.4s)]
*  onto Twitter, the one on the left [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=498.76s)]
*  is from the Ursula processing center at the border, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=500.0s)]
*  shelves and pallets packed with baby formula [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=502.24s)]
*  that congressman wrote. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=504.24s)]
*  The second is from an empty shelf here in the United States [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=505.38s)]
*  reserved for American citizens. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=507.92s)]
*  So there's never been a clearer statement [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=510.24s)]
*  of the administration's priorities. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=513.0s)]
*  Hey, American mothers, your kids are too expensive, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=514.4s)]
*  go have an abortion and get back to work [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=517.4s)]
*  in an Amazon warehouse. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=519.16s)]
*  Congresswoman Katie Porter of California [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=521.72s)]
*  said that out loud this week. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=523.7s)]
*  You're poor, have an abortion, get back to work. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=526.9s)]
*  Other Democrats said the same, try breastfeeding! [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=530.82s)]
*  Exclamation point, wrote 76 year old [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=533.76s)]
*  Bette Midler today on Twitter. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=536.0s)]
*  It's free and available on demand. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=538.24s)]
*  It's been a while since she's done that, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=540.96s)]
*  but that's her position. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  So here you have an elderly, out of touch, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  rich liberal lady lecturing struggling American moms [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  to shut up and suffer in silence. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=551.5400000000001s)]
*  And by the way, make your baby shut up too. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=553.32s)]
*  Now, if you can think of a more perfect distillation [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  of modern politics of the left circa 2022 than that, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=559.74s)]
*  send us an email and let us know what it is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=565.72s)]
*  because we've never seen anything that perfect. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=567.32s)]
*  And yet, here's the interesting part. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=570.48s)]
*  That's not at all the message that the Bette Midlers [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=573.84s)]
*  of the world are sending to the millions of illegal aliens [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=576.1800000000001s)]
*  who are flooding into our country. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=578.4000000000001s)]
*  The message to them is just the opposite. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=580.46s)]
*  Come, we welcome you. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=582.08s)]
*  We will subsidize your childbearing, whatever it takes. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=583.72s)]
*  Even if we have to take baby formula for American citizens, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=588.24s)]
*  we will help you. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=591.2600000000001s)]
*  That's literally what they're saying. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=593.58s)]
*  And more to the point, that's what they're doing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=595.84s)]
*  So how do you get the Biden administration [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=598.52s)]
*  to pay attention to American citizens, to you? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=601.1s)]
*  Let's say you need baby formula, you can't get it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=604.0400000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden doesn't care. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=605.72s)]
*  Bette Midler's mocking you. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  Go breastfeed, it's free. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  How do you get them to awaken to the fact that you exist, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=611.08s)]
*  that American children are suffering? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=615.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, it turns out there is a way to do that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=617.64s)]
*  The baby formula shortage, and we look this up, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=620.6800000000001s)]
*  like every crisis in this country may affect you, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=622.88s)]
*  but it affects trans people disproportionately [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=626.16s)]
*  because trans people are always, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=629.36s)]
*  and Joe Biden often says this, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=630.84s)]
*  are the ones who suffer most. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=632.06s)]
*  And as Congresswoman Cori Bush once told us, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M9Ack29DCI&t=634.18s)]
