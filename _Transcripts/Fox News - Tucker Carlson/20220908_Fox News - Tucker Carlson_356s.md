# Tucker Carlson: This is why they are attacking Queen Elizabeth II
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, Queen Elizabeth II died today in Scotland, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=1.92s)]
*  as you likely know, at the age of 96. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  She was the longest serving monarch in British history. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=7.38s)]
*  She was born in one world and died in another. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=10.36s)]
*  It's not easy to maintain your dignity [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=13.38s)]
*  while living in the public eye. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=15.38s)]
*  Most of us could not pull it off for an afternoon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=16.54s)]
*  Queen Elizabeth did it for more than 70 years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=19.14s)]
*  "'I want to ask you all,' she wrote [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=21.6s)]
*  shortly before her coronation in 1953, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=23.26s)]
*  "'whatever your religion may be, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=25.86s)]
*  "'to pray for me on that day, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=27.46s)]
*  "'to pray that God may give me wisdom and strength [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=29.36s)]
*  "'to carry out the solemn promises I shall be making [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=31.98s)]
*  "'and that I may faithfully serve him and you [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=34.9s)]
*  "'all the days of my life.'" [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=37.9s)]
*  For the most part, she did just that, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=40.18s)]
*  and that was not a small achievement [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=41.88s)]
*  given the period she lived in. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=43.42s)]
*  The week that Elizabeth was coronated, Edmund Hillary, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=46.42s)]
*  a British subject from New Zealand, a beekeeper, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=49.3s)]
*  became the first man in history to summit Mount Everest. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=51.66s)]
*  The achievement seemed symbolic at the time, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=55.0s)]
*  Britain on top of the world. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=56.7s)]
*  But in fact, Britain was already over, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=58.68s)]
*  whether the British knew it or not. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=60.4s)]
*  To this day, Britain claims to have won [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=62.4s)]
*  both of the 20th century's world wars, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=64.42s)]
*  but together they destroyed that nation forever. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=66.68s)]
*  After victory came humiliation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=69.06s)]
*  The empire evaporated, and along with it, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=71.64s)]
*  Britain's self-confidence and ultimately its self-respect. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=73.66s)]
*  It's hard to believe now, but Britain wasn't always [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=77.08s)]
*  a regional banking center slash refugee camp. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=79.18s)]
*  It was a real place with a history and a language [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=82.08s)]
*  and a culture and a genuinely remarkable people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=84.48s)]
*  A country in the North Atlantic the size of Alabama [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=88.02s)]
*  that somehow took over the world and ruled it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=90.94s)]
*  with decency unmatched by any empire in human history. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  The British Empire was not perfect, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  but it was far more humane than any other ever. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=100.06s)]
*  It's gone now, barely even remembered. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=103.5s)]
*  Queen Elizabeth II was the last living link [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=105.82s)]
*  to a truly great Britain. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=108.78s)]
*  Today on social media, the usual ghouls celebrated her death. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=111.08s)]
*  Quote, may her pain be excruciating, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=114.46s)]
*  a Carnegie Mellon professor called Uju Anya [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=116.5s)]
*  wrote on Twitter of the queen, may she die in agony. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=119.02s)]
*  Various no nothings in the media, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=122.7s)]
*  including a columnist at the Atlantic [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=124.02s)]
*  and a couple of employees of NBC News, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=125.58s)]
*  seconded that thought. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=127.42s)]
*  The British Empire was evil, they wrote, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=129.66s)]
*  apparently totally unaware of what came after it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=131.68s)]
*  And speaking of what did come after the British Empire, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=134.62s)]
*  how, for example, did Africa fare after the British left? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=137.9s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=140.7s)]
*  Uganda got Idi Amin, who was a cannibal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=141.74s)]
*  Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and then became the poorest country [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=145.1s)]
*  on the planet under the racist lunatic Robert Mugabe. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=148.54s)]
*  As of tonight, South Africa is still being run [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=151.7s)]
*  into the ground by an incompetent kleptocrat [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=153.78s)]
*  called Shiro Remopozo. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=155.98s)]
*  So it's hard to see any of that as an improvement [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=158.14s)]
*  because it's not an improvement. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=160.34s)]
*  Sorry, Atlantic Magazine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=161.9s)]
*  And now, of course, the entire continent of Africa [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=163.7s)]
*  has a new master, the Chinese government. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=165.82s)]
*  China is the latest colonial power to dominate Africa. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=168.22s)]
*  Its subjects will be pining for the British soon, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  assuming they are not already. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=174.02s)]
*  In an ideal world, there would not be empires, no empires, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=176.5s)]
*  only sovereign nations, but we don't have that world. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=179.06s)]
*  And we never have had that world, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  going back to at least the Assyrians, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=183.9s)]
*  1400 years before Christ. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=185.5s)]
*  In the real world, the one that we live in, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  strong countries dominate weak countries. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=189.56s)]
*  And that trend shows no sign of changing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=192.18s)]
*  The very least you can say about the English [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=195.18s)]
*  is that they took their colonial responsibilities seriously. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=196.74s)]
*  They didn't just take things, they added. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=199.42000000000002s)]
*  When the US government withdrew from Afghanistan [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=202.38s)]
*  after 20 years, we left behind airstrips, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=204.22s)]
*  shipping containers, and guns. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=206.66s)]
*  When the British pulled out of India, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=208.92s)]
*  they left behind an entire civilization, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=210.42s)]
*  a language, a legal system, schools, churches, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=212.82s)]
*  and public buildings, all of which are still in use today. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=215.66s)]
*  Here's the train station the English built [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=219.14s)]
*  in Bombay, for example. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=220.98s)]
*  There's nothing like that in Washington, DC right now, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=222.7s)]
*  much less in Kabul or Baghdad. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=225.34s)]
*  Today, India is far more powerful than the UK, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=227.5s)]
*  the nation that once ruled it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=230.04s)]
*  And yet, after 75 years of independence, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  has that country produced a single building as beautiful [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=234.11999999999998s)]
*  as the Bombay train station [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=237.28s)]
*  that the British colonialists built? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=238.64s)]
*  No, sadly it has not, not one. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  So despite what they may be claiming on Twitter tonight, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=243.44s)]
*  the British Empire was more than just genocide. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  In fact, the British did not commit genocide, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=247.72s)]
*  except arguably against the Dutch during the Boer War. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=249.61999999999998s)]
*  The British did give the world the Magna Carta [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=252.66s)]
*  and habeas corpus and free speech. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=255.16s)]
*  They helped end the transatlantic slave trade, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=257.96s)]
*  as well as the ritual murder of widows in India. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=259.96s)]
*  The British Empire spread Protestant Christianity [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=263.08s)]
*  to the entire world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=265.28s)]
*  It published some of the greatest literature ever written [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=266.85999999999996s)]
*  and produced the finest manufactured goods [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  ever made anywhere at any time, including now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=271.56s)]
*  It was an impressive place run by impressive people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=275.52s)]
*  We will see many empires going forward, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=279.2s)]
*  but we will never see one so benign. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=280.96s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=283.9s)]
*  And because it's true, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=285.24s)]
*  the people who would like to run the world [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  in a far harsher way would like to make certain [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=288.16s)]
*  that you don't know it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=291.0s)]
*  And so they destroy the evidence, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=292.6s)]
*  the evidence that ever existed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=294.16s)]
*  Here they are tearing down a statue [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=296.0s)]
*  of a British philanthropist in the UK two years ago. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  Oh boy! [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=313.92s)]
*  Oh my God! [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  Destroy the statue, erase the memory. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=326.6s)]
*  That's why they're doing it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_OzymdJ03c&t=329.78000000000003s)]
