# Lara Trump reacts to AG Merrick Garland approving raid
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w)
*  Meanwhile, one of the few things we know about the FBI's raid on Mar-a-Lago is that it involves classified documentation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=0.0s)]
*  The National Archive claims the documents belong to them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=6.12s)]
*  President Trump's attorneys were reportedly already complying with the FBI on these documents earlier this year, as late as June. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=9.8s)]
*  So why did Merrick go and approve a warrant for the raid? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=16.4s)]
*  Laura, Trump joins us right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=19.66s)]
*  Laura, could you bring us through the week that you and your family have had from Monday's raid till today's presser? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=21.56s)]
*  Well, this is not the week we planned, Brian, I can tell you that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=30.56s)]
*  But, you know, unfortunately, I think a lot of us in the Trump family have gotten used to this kind of treatment. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=34.08s)]
*  You know, we have been targeted. We have been harassed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=39.44s)]
*  I would say that Donald Trump is probably the most harassed, investigated president in American history. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=42.96s)]
*  You think that with all that they're doing—and you just talked about the New York attorney general. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=48.6s)]
*  You have, you know, district attorneys in Manhattan. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=54.2s)]
*  You have, obviously, this raid at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=56.6s)]
*  If up until this point, for the past almost seven years, that Donald Trump has been harassed and investigated, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=59.4s)]
*  that there was anything to find on Donald Trump, you think it wouldn't have been found by now? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=65.12s)]
*  I mean, he ran a clean company. He had a great business. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=70.72s)]
*  He still has a great company run by my husband. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=73.64s)]
*  But this sort of thing, obviously, is not easy to go through as a family, but it's not easy to go through as an American. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=77.0s)]
*  And I can tell you that I've heard from so many people, Brian, all across this country, people that aren't even Republicans. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=83.0s)]
*  They are horrified by what we saw happen on Monday, because this was not just an attack on Donald Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=89.24s)]
*  It wasn't just a raid of Mar-a-Lago, of a former president's home. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=95.88s)]
*  This changed the way that the American people see our country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=99.6s)]
*  We cannot operate in a civilized society and not trust our Department of Justice. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=103.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's where we are. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=109.32s)]
*  Merrick Garland came out today and didn't clear any of that up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=111.6s)]
*  If anything, we have more questions now, the American people, by and large, than they did a couple hours ago before he even came out and spoke. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  So what's interesting is, too, those two attorneys, two of which we've seen a lot on the air in various podcasts and television networks, including one on Jesse's show, they weren't even allowed inside. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  They would sit outside. It was about 98 degrees in Florida, and they sat outside for the eight, nine hours trying to get an understanding of what exactly is happening, what's the premise and predicate behind it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  And I happened to talk to Eric on Monday, and I could not believe how cool and calculated he was, how angry he is, but almost saying, look, this is what I'm dealing with on a regular basis. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=141.0s)]
*  But what I also found is I was watching the BBC and Sky News. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=152.88s)]
*  They can't make heads or tails of it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  They're asking our reporters, what's going on in America? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=158.36s)]
*  And I kind of worry about that beyond this administration, beyond the past administration, do you? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think everyone is worried about it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=169.56s)]
*  I think that we don't see the country that we used to know right now, this sort of political harassment and targeting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=171.28s)]
*  These are things that happen in communist countries and third world dictatorships, not in the United States of America. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=178.72s)]
*  And I don't know how you come back from this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=185.12s)]
*  Even if my father-in-law decides to run and wins in 2024, which I believe if he decides to run, he will win. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=187.56s)]
*  How do you reassure the American people at any point that you've gotten this taken care of, that you can, that the Department of Justice is something they can trust again? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=194.56s)]
*  I don't know, but I can tell you this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  People are fired up out there in the first couple of hours after this was announced, Brian. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  The fundraising to reelect Donald Trump has been more than since the day he left office. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=213.4s)]
*  People want him back and they want him back as soon as possible. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=218.68s)]
*  So let's read this together. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  The Washington Post has just crossed with this story. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  They believe the reason why the raid took place is because they were worried that your father-in-law had documents relating to nuclear weapons among the items the FBI wanted back. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=225.88s)]
*  Experts in classified information said the unusual search underscores deep concern among government officials about the types of information they thought could be located at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  Did you see any nuclear reports at the Mar-a-Lago club, maybe around the pool by the lifeguard stand? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=246.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, those were not disseminated freely at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=254.72s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=258.72s)]
*  But I mean, who knows, by the way? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=260.0s)]
*  I think it's a mystery to a lot of people what could possibly rise to the level of not taking a bit of a different approach and instead raiding the former president's home. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=262.76s)]
*  I mean, it's just absolutely outrageous, Brian. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=273.48s)]
*  This is not the country that we've come to know and love for so long. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=276.92s)]
*  And lastly, this, and you know, they'll expand on this story, but I saw there's a report out there that Ivanka Malani went up to the president said, listen, I've had enough. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=280.36s)]
*  Don't run again. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=289.56s)]
*  Could you tell me if that is indeed the case? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=290.8s)]
*  Is there a sense within the family that it's just getting too much? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=292.72s)]
*  I can tell you that every single member of our family, if we wanted him to run before, which we are all happy to support him, we want him to do it even more now because somebody has got to take this country back. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=296.88s)]
*  Somebody has got to restore faith in America. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=310.0s)]
*  And I think the only person to do that, quite frankly, is Donald Trump. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  Laura Trump, I'll talk to you again. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=316.04s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=317.44s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHar_oSuZ4w&t=325.88s)]
