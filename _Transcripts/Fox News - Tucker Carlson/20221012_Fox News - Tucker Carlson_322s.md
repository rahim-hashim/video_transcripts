# Owens details shocking documentary exposing Black Lives Matter funding
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U)
*  Remember the BLM movement, May of 2020, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=0.0s)]
*  when every high school girl in America [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=3.56s)]
*  was absolutely required to put a black square [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=5.24s)]
*  on her Instagram page, remember that? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=7.04s)]
*  BLM, everyone's for BLM. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=9.16s)]
*  Mitt Romney marched with BLM. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=10.72s)]
*  What was that? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=12.0s)]
*  Well, it was a scam, actually, it turns out. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=13.52s)]
*  It was a scam, and it really hurt the country. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=15.88s)]
*  Candace Owens has done an entire documentary on this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=18.12s)]
*  It's called The Greatest Lie Ever Sold, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=21.42s)]
*  George Floyd and the Rise to BLM. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=23.2s)]
*  For the documentary, she showed up to the gated mansion [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=26.04s)]
*  in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=28.5s)]
*  owned by BLM co-founder, Patrice Cullors. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=30.22s)]
*  Cullors then posted a video on Instagram [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=33.02s)]
*  complaining about Candace Owens' reporting. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=34.78s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=36.9s)]
*  So we are headed to Laurel Canyon. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=38.5s)]
*  We've yet to see any black people in this neighborhood. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=40.42s)]
*  So there's definitely somebody home. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  Hello? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=44.78s)]
*  I was just looking to speak to whoever is at this property. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=47.86s)]
*  Sir? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=51.78s)]
*  Hello? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=53.3s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to get someone. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=54.62s)]
*  I see a very cute German shepherd, it looks like. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=56.78s)]
*  This morning, I woke up to Candace Owens [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=59.94s)]
*  being outside of my house with a news crew. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=63.5s)]
*  I can't see how this purchase helped black lives [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=66.98s)]
*  anywhere in America. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=70.18s)]
*  I can't even find a black life on the property. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=71.62s)]
*  The dog's not even black, so, what's that? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=75.34s)]
*  And so they're literally trying to get me out of here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=78.82s)]
*  Trying to destroy us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=83.66s)]
*  They're trying to destroy me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=85.86s)]
*  They're trying to destroy the movement. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=87.94s)]
*  And I really just need us to be stronger. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=90.94s)]
*  When you live at a multi-million dollar home [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=96.05999999999999s)]
*  in Laurel Canyon, it can be hard. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=98.05999999999999s)]
*  Candace Owens is the person who caused the suffering [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=101.66s)]
*  you just saw. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=104.41999999999999s)]
*  She's the producer of the brand new documentary, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  The Greatest Lie Ever Sold, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=106.38s)]
*  George Floyd, The Rise of BLM, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  one of the bravest people we know, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=108.94s)]
*  and one of the smartest joins us tonight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  Candace Owens, thanks so much. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=111.58s)]
*  First of all, thank you for doing this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=112.74s)]
*  It's like that whole moment is forgotten. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=114.1s)]
*  Why did you think it was important [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=117.3s)]
*  to make a documentary about it? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=118.3s)]
*  Because of exactly what you said, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=121.34s)]
*  because they want you to forget it, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=122.58s)]
*  They do these things, they sort of punch you in the face [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=124.78s)]
*  and then they move on and they say, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=126.62s)]
*  nobody look any further. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=127.66s)]
*  We're now moving on to a different narrative. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=128.82s)]
*  It is important to pause and to reflect [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  and to consider what happened and ask a very big question, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=132.34s)]
*  which for whatever reason, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=135.1s)]
*  no journalist was interested in at the time. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=135.94s)]
*  We were all basically required to either put up [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=138.18s)]
*  a black square or donate to Black Lives Matter [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=140.34s)]
*  or to make some statement online [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  about how black people are suffering [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=144.38000000000002s)]
*  to make sure that Black Lives Matter [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=145.58s)]
*  would receive the $80 million that it received in one year. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=146.74s)]
*  But nobody asked the question, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=150.10000000000002s)]
*  where is all the money going? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  I was interested because they turned me [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=152.38000000000002s)]
*  into public enemy number one [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  for accurately talking about George Floyd, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=155.62s)]
*  not in the capacity of a hero, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=158.18s)]
*  but in the capacity of a person who was addicted to drugs [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=159.58s)]
*  and who had enough fentanyl in his system [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=162.06s)]
*  to kill a horse at the time that he died. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=164.3s)]
*  That made people angry because people were invested [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  in the emotion of Black Lives Matter. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=168.22000000000003s)]
*  So look, I'm wearing the shirt, it is the BLM symbol, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=170.14s)]
*  but instead I've inserted some cash into it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  because what they really did is they robbed Americans. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=174.5s)]
*  They robbed Americans' emotions, they extracted emotions, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=177.14s)]
*  they used black pain to create confusion [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=179.54s)]
*  and to take millions upon millions, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars from people. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=183.98s)]
*  And where did the money go, Tucker? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=185.78s)]
*  That's what documentary explores, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=187.18s)]
*  that people are going to be shocked. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  I hope people are very behind the transgendered movement [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  because that's where a lot of this money went [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=193.5s)]
*  and then there's just a dead trail [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=195.1s)]
*  because the one thing that you're afforded [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=196.5s)]
*  when you decide that you are transgendered [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  is you can change your name. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=199.54s)]
*  So you don't know who any of these people were originally, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=200.94s)]
*  but they received hundreds and thousands [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=203.38s)]
*  and millions of dollars of cash. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=205.42s)]
*  I just can't control myself and know [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=209.34s)]
*  because I was there and I watched it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=212.18s)]
*  You were basically banned from all media, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  including some conservative outlets, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=216.22s)]
*  but for telling the truth, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=217.78s)]
*  the factual documented truth about George Floyd, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=219.29999999999998s)]
*  you were not allowed to tell the truth, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=221.98s)]
*  which really was, I think, a dark moment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=224.38s)]
*  Let me ask you, do you know anybody, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  apart from the ladies living in Laurel Canyon [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  and the transgenders you just mentioned, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=231.26s)]
*  any actual normal black person who benefited from BLM? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=237.54s)]
*  It's the exact opposite. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=238.5s)]
*  I can tell you millions of black people who suffered [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=239.38s)]
*  because they now live in the inner cities that were looted [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  and that were rioted and therefore the businesses picked up, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  which my documentary will show, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=246.42s)]
*  they picked up and they left [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=247.54s)]
*  because why wouldn't they leave, obviously? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  They're basically saying that crime is allowed to take place [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=250.82s)]
*  and these are zones in which there can be no policing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=253.14s)]
*  So these people are now suffering economically [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=256.38s)]
*  and we of course, particularly that that would be the outcome [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=258.38s)]
*  because of the BLM scam, which benefited nobody. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=260.73999999999995s)]
*  And there are a lot of questions. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=263.78s)]
*  In my personal opinion, this was a money laundering scheme [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=264.9s)]
*  and it is interesting that these individuals, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=267.46s)]
*  like Patrice Collors, decided to host [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=269.38s)]
*  a Joe Biden inauguration party [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=271.29999999999995s)]
*  at the Black Lives Matter house. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=273.29999999999995s)]
*  Again, all of that is in the documentary. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=274.73999999999995s)]
*  It's stunning and I do wanna add this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfMiXbVH4U&t=276.26s)]
