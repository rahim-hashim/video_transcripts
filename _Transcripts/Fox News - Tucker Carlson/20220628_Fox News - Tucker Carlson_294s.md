# Key Jan. 6 figure reveals encounter with FBI
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw)
*  We're broadcasting from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil tonight, one of the most famous cities in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=0.0s)]
*  world and for good reason, certainly one of the most beautiful on the planet. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=8.4s)]
*  You're looking at the Christ the Redeemer statue that's in the summit of Mount Corcovado, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=11.8s)]
*  an amazing statue built in the early 30s. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=17.36s)]
*  We're going to go there later in the week. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=20.12s)]
*  So the January 6th committee has nothing to do with January 6th. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=23.56s)]
*  The point of it is to punish the political opponents of the Biden administration and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=27.64s)]
*  to make certain Donald Trump doesn't run again. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=33.0s)]
*  And they're doing it with the assistance of the so-called Justice Department as run by [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=34.6s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=37.72s)]
*  So already the committee, speaking of Stalinist overreach, has had Steve Bannon and Peter [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=38.72s)]
*  Navarro arrested, neither of whom committed any crime. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=43.24s)]
*  They've also had the Fed search the home of a former DOJ official called Jeffrey Clark, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=47.64s)]
*  who we spoke to last week. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=51.64s)]
*  Then on Wednesday, the FBI showed up to seize the phone of a former Trump attorney called [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=53.64s)]
*  John Eastman. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=58.46s)]
*  Now, critically and illegally, they seized his phone before they presented him with a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=59.46s)]
*  warrant. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=65.06s)]
*  And it's on tape. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=66.06s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=67.06s)]
*  Sir, go ahead and put your arms up for me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=68.06s)]
*  Can I see the warrant, please? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=69.06s)]
*  I'd like to see the warrant. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=70.06s)]
*  I'd like to see the warrant. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=71.06s)]
*  I'd like to see the warrant. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=72.06s)]
*  Can I see the warrant, please? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=73.06s)]
*  I'd like to see the warrant before you take my property. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=74.06s)]
*  I want you to see that they took my property before providing me with the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=83.06s)]
*  warrant. I'd like to read the warrant. Disgraceful wearing his little mask put [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=94.3s)]
*  your hands up as if Eastman is a threat he's not he's a lawyer as you just saw [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=100.62s)]
*  he's under subpoena from the speaking of illegitimate wholly illegitimate [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  Palosi Liz Cheney led January 6th committee Mr. Eastman joins us tonight [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=109.58s)]
*  John Eastman thank you so much for joining us tonight what exactly did you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=113.74s)]
*  do wrong to be treated like a dangerous criminal by your government that you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  pay for? Well we don't know because the warrant doesn't say it authorizes them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=123.1s)]
*  to seize my phone and all the information contained in the phone but [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=128.22s)]
*  there's no indication of any crime that this is connected to that's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=133.02s)]
*  apparently in an attached in an affidavit but the affidavit wasn't [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=138.62s)]
*  attached to the warrant the Fourth Amendment is very clear here when they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  search and seize your property they have to give a particular description of the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=146.02s)]
*  things to be seized and in saying it's identified in the affidavit if they [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  don't attach the affidavit doesn't qualify the courts have been very clear [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  about that so this this warrant is invalid on its face but more importantly [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  and I think this is extremely important the the authority to seize all of my [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=163.86s)]
*  information in modern modern smartphones that's access to all my [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=168.54s)]
*  private financial records I'm an attorney it's access to all my privileged [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=172.94s)]
*  communications with nearly a hundred different clients that I have currently [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  this stuff this stuff is what we used to call a general warrant that the British [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=180.42s)]
*  King issued to just go rummage through somebody's belongings to see if they [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=185.78s)]
*  could find evidence of some crime the very reason we have the Fourth Amendment [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  is to prevent that kind of abuse and yet that's what they're doing here and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=193.42s)]
*  it's just another reminder to anyone who didn't vote for Joe Biden to erase your [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=198.54s)]
*  texts and emails every single day and that is a sincere piece of advice I hope [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=202.94s)]
*  everyone follows but they haven't charged you with a crime they've given [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=207.14s)]
*  you no evidence that they're going to charge you with a crime but they treat [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=210.94s)]
*  you like a drug kingpin or a rapist and seize your phone it is this legal and I [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=214.7s)]
*  don't think so and they forced me in the position look I as an attorney I have [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=222.26s)]
*  ethical obligations to do everything I can to protect the privilege [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=226.3s)]
*  communications with my clients so we will be filing a motion it's called a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=230.38s)]
*  rule 41 motion to retrieve my phone to retrieve any information they've taken [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=235.1s)]
*  off of that phone that they have illegally seized from me and we'll be [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=240.3s)]
*  doing that in short order but but you know what they're doing the other thing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=244.1s)]
*  they're doing is they're forcing those of us that you know don't bow the knee [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=248.62s)]
*  to the Biden administration to rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=251.9s)]
*  legal fees trying to protect our constitutional rights and those of our [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=255.66s)]
*  clients so let me let me ask people give send go comm slash Eastman help us help [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=258.98s)]
*  us fight this abuse we've got it we've got to stand together to fight against [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl4yJiPDBKw&t=265.42s)]
