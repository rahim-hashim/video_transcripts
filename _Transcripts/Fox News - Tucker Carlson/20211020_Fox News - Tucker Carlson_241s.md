# Tucker: UFOs need to be taken seriously
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok)
*  Oh, another UFO segment. That's crazy. You'd have to be crazy to believe that's possible. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=0.0s)]
*  Really? Is it any crazier than what's coming out of, say, your average White House briefing? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=14.32s)]
*  No, it really isn't. So with that in mind, a fascinating conference today about UFOs [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=18.32s)]
*  and nuclear weapons that took place in Washington added a U.S. Air Force captain called David [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=24.12s)]
*  Shindeli said he was part of an incident in which a UFO disabled 10 nuclear ICBM missiles. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Here's part of what he said. There has been a long history of UFO incidents and encounters [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=34.64s)]
*  with much investigation of them from 1947 and even earlier. In September of 1966, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=40.64s)]
*  I was a Minuteman ICBM launch control officer and deputy commander of a launch crew stationed at [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=48.24s)]
*  Minut Air Force Base, North Dakota. I was involved in a UFO incident at that time where a flying object [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=54.32s)]
*  tampered with and took down a total of 10 nuclear tipped ICBM missiles by rendering them unlaunchable. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=62.64s)]
*  Tom Rogan is one of the rare serious journalists, actual journalists, in Washington who's been on [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=71.92s)]
*  this story for years in a very rigorous way. He's a columnist now with the Washington Examiner. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=76.88s)]
*  Following the conference today, he joins us tonight for a recap. Tom, thanks a lot for coming on. So [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=81.92s)]
*  what did you learn today at this event? Thanks, Tucker. Yeah, I think the key point here is that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=85.92s)]
*  although these gentlemen have been telling their stories for a while, now they are doing it in a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=92.72s)]
*  fashion where they can finally be taken seriously by more people. And fortunately though, there [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=98.56s)]
*  weren't that many journalists there today, but there were more perhaps than there have been. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=104.16s)]
*  I think the key point though is that people with some of the highest security clearances [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=108.32s)]
*  at the height of the Cold War for the U.S. Air Force, multiple different individuals at [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=113.44s)]
*  multiple different sites across a period of decades, say that UFOs interacted with nuclear [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=118.16s)]
*  weapons platforms and either rendered them inoperable or took them offline. And so something [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  was done by a technological force, as these officers would suggest, that cannot be explained. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=131.36s)]
*  And that in and of itself surely should be big news worthy of serious further investigation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, by definition, any force that can take America's nuclear weapons offline is something [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  you need to worry about. Presumably the Pentagon has been looking at this, assessed it. Have they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  given any indication of what they think happened? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=157.12s)]
*  What's I think unfortunate, and I guess we're at the start of a process, the director of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=162.32s)]
*  national intelligence had this report, but what's unfortunate is that the government does know that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=167.12s)]
*  there is a nuclear connection. They've kept that classified. Frankly, I can understand why some of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=171.44s)]
*  it is classified, but they should come clean with a lot more that they know. I mean, the simple fact, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  the U.S. Navy, why does the Navy keep seeing these things with the aircraft carriers? Well, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=182.56s)]
*  aircraft carriers are nuclear powered. Why do submarines see them? Nuclear connection. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=186.8s)]
*  This nuclear missile incidents from the Cold War, there's credible testimony from a great historian [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  on this, Robert Hastings, who wrote a book UFOs and Nukes to suggest that the Soviets had similar [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=199.36s)]
*  experiences. Something is going on here. It's not America, it's not China, it's not Russia. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  And we need to get a grip and take it seriously instead of laughing it off as [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  an issue for crazy people. Right. I mean, there are a lot of crazy people in this world right now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=213.68s)]
*  I would say the people who take this seriously may be among the least crazy in our public [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=218.8s)]
*  conversation. You're certainly in that category. Tom Rogan, appreciate you coming on tonight and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=222.72s)]
*  covering this. Thank you. Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv47CY7_Ok&t=225.76000000000002s)]
