# The war on dead presidents: Jimmy Failla
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4)
*  Jimmy Fela is the host of Fox Across America with Jimmy Fela. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. Jimmy, this is a problem for The Post. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=3.06s)]
*  Yo, this is my favorite thing in the world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=6.76s)]
*  The idea that this snuck into The Washington Post, Tucker. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=9.9s)]
*  Apparently, Jeff Bezos put the brick-and-mortar editors [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=13.5s)]
*  out of business, too, because they should have caught this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=16.38s)]
*  It's absurd, and it's such a self-own. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=19.22s)]
*  But I want to start at the tippy-top, man. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  This whole idea of declaring war on dead presidents [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  drives me personally crazy because George Washington, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=27.36s)]
*  by the standards of the day he lived in, number one, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=30.66s)]
*  was an outstanding human being. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=32.62s)]
*  But number two, this is personal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=34.32s)]
*  My son is named Lincoln. I have one kid, Tucker. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=35.66s)]
*  We decided to stop breeding after the first report card. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=40.26s)]
*  We were like, you know what? We should probably get a dog [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=42.9s)]
*  or something. This isn't working out. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=44.9s)]
*  But I have a son named Lincoln, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=47.1s)]
*  and even his name is controversial now, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=48.6s)]
*  so he's going by his middle name, O.J. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=50.6s)]
*  But no, think about this. Really stick with me here, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  because this drives me crazy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=56.46s)]
*  Everybody that tries to point out our past, okay, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=58.0s)]
*  is also highlighting our progress when they do it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=61.4s)]
*  What did this op-ed say? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=63.94s)]
*  Oh, in 1821, it was whites only at George Washington University. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=65.34s)]
*  Sure, it was. And we don't love that, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=70.1s)]
*  but no nation has worked harder to improve it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=71.78s)]
*  Fast forward to 2022. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=73.94s)]
*  The only place left that's whites only [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=75.74s)]
*  is Sheldon Whitehouse's Country Club. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=77.94s)]
*  There's no other place where they're excluding black people. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=80.52s)]
*  But this is the thing, Tucker. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=83.92s)]
*  Now, woke Democrats are cultural arsonists. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  They like to find new forms of oppression, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=89.88s)]
*  set little societal fires so they can extinguish them [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=93.28s)]
*  and then claim valor and virtue. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  But the trick is, none of it helps the black community. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  So when you think about the black community right now, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=101.92s)]
*  Tucker, they're being plagued by failing schools [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=103.56s)]
*  and astonishingly high rates of violent crime. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=105.69999999999999s)]
*  Nowhere tonight is a guy who's getting crushed by inflation [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=108.52s)]
*  getting mugged for those overpriced goods, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=111.1s)]
*  and if only somebody could stop by and rename a statue, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=113.06s)]
*  or you know what I mean, rename a school. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  And that's the part that drives me crazy, man. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=117.76s)]
*  Well, you're right. They're arsonists. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  They only destroy, they never build. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  Build your own impressive country, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  your own impressive school, but they can't. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=125.14s)]
*  They can only wreck things that other people made. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=126.64s)]
*  Well, that's the hook. That's the hook. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=128.44s)]
*  It's so much easier, Tucker, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=130.5s)]
*  to sell victimhood to the black community [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=131.94s)]
*  than it is to sell them progress. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=134.38s)]
*  Really quick, this is new. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=136.08s)]
*  When Barack Obama ran for president, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=137.84s)]
*  what was the motto? Yes, we can. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=139.58s)]
*  If he showed up now in the age of incentivized victimhood [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=141.5s)]
*  with yes, we can, they'd be like, yo, yes, we can. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=144.1s)]
*  Check your privilege, half white guy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  What do you mean, yes, we can? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=149.48s)]
*  And that's the part that's so stupid. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=151.0s)]
*  Well, it's unbelievably stupid. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=153.2s)]
*  And, you know, get back to me [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=154.54s)]
*  when you build something worth having. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=155.48s)]
*  That's what I always think when they yell. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=156.64s)]
*  Jimmy, thanks so much. Great to see you tonight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=158.44s)]
*  Tucker, you're the man. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oje2v8ThY4&t=159.88s)]
