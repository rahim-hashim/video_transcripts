# Tucker: This is dark
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, did you watch the State of the Union address last night? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=3.4s)]
*  We do not blame you if you took a pass on that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=6.16s)]
*  Tuning in was a grim task. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=8.8s)]
*  80-year-old Joe Biden shuffling stifflegged and bewildered to the podium, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=11.36s)]
*  a husk held together by Botox, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=15.4s)]
*  and enough amphetamines from the White House doctor to read the slogans written for him [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=17.84s)]
*  by unelected Obama acolytes who actually run the government. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=20.92s)]
*  This is our president, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=23.52s)]
*  It's always pretty hard to believe when you see it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=26.2s)]
*  The whole scene is so awful, so degrading to our once-proud country, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=28.04s)]
*  it cannot end soon enough. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=31.48s)]
*  But the moment was, we will confess, at times pretty amusing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=33.56s)]
*  At one point, the eminent TV doctor, Dr. Jill, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=36.96s)]
*  who really ought to have her own show on Bravo dispensing sassy and empowering medical advice, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=40.8s)]
*  walked over to Kamala Harris's husband, Doug Enhoff, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  and kissed him deeply square in the mouth without a mask, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  something that never, ever happens at his house. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=52.28s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=55.24s)]
*  There was an unmistakable 1970s suburban Connecticut key party vibe to it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=56.88s)]
*  Kind of a John Sheaver story, old school stuff, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=61.64s)]
*  except they let bystanders film the whole thing, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  so clearly these people are exhibitionists, too. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=67.64s)]
*  Naughty. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=69.64s)]
*  There's a lot going on behind the scenes in the Biden administration, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=71.28s)]
*  a lot of which we don't want to know more about. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=73.68s)]
*  But where do these people find the time for hijinks? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=75.76s)]
*  Dr. Jill, for example, is extremely, extremely busy, way busier than you are. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=79.4s)]
*  According to her husband, Dr. Jill is working day and night [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  to drag this country out of its medieval ignorance. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  And that's not an easy task. Watch. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=90.68s)]
*  Jill, my wife, who teaches full-time, has an expression. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=93.76s)]
*  Hope I get it right, kid. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=98.08s)]
*  Any nation that out-educates us is gonna out-compete us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=105.64s)]
*  Dr. Jill is teaching, quote, full-time? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=107.56s)]
*  How many hours a week is full-time? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=111.04s)]
*  And where is this happening? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=112.8s)]
*  What school or university or madrasa is she teaching at? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=114.0s)]
*  What is she teaching? Can we sign up for her class? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=116.88s)]
*  How come we didn't know any of this until last night? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=120.2s)]
*  Any nation that out-educates us is going to out-compete us, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=123.44s)]
*  says Dr. Jill, and that's a fair point. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=126.64s)]
*  Today is the first day of the rest of your life. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=128.52s)]
*  Bravo, Dr. Jill, bravo! [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=131.0s)]
*  The question is, how shall we as a nation respond to Dr. Jill's clarion call for action? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=133.8s)]
*  Obviously, you need to shut down the schools for an entire year [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=140.24s)]
*  because United's teachers feel like longer vacations, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=142.16s)]
*  and then get rid of all standardized tests because racism. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=144.48s)]
*  That's the solution. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  It turns out that Dr. Jill, who, like an awful lot of community college geniuses from Delaware [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=149.56s)]
*  who've received advanced degrees in, quote, education, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=153.44s)]
*  she has an awful lot of good ideas. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=156.6s)]
*  We ought to listen to her more. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=158.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, we don't often get the chance because she's always teaching. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=159.6s)]
*  So that really was the highlight of the evening, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=163.72s)]
*  Dr. Jill making out with the vice president's husband [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=165.6s)]
*  and then Joe Biden bragging about a job she doesn't actually have. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=168.24s)]
*  Pretty hard not to find that funny. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=171.16s)]
*  And then there was Biden himself. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=173.72s)]
*  Now, the president's mental condition is either scary and depressing, deeply alarming, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=175.2s)]
*  or absolutely hilarious, depending upon your mood. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=178.88s)]
*  Last night, for lack of other entertainment options, we decided to find it funny. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  So take in this steaming pile of word puree and see if you can make sense of it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=186.84s)]
*  As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  we will act to protect our country, and we did. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=196.2s)]
*  But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=200.84s)]
*  Autocracy has grown weaker, not stronger. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=204.44s)]
*  Name me a world leader who changed places with Xi Jinping. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=206.8s)]
*  Name me one. Name me one. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  We shot down their balloon. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=215.84s)]
*  So name me a world leader who can decipher what Joe Biden just said. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  Name me one. See, you can't. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  Friends, democracy is winning tonight. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  Now, we have no idea what any of that means any more than Xi Jinping does, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=226.8s)]
*  but the train seals in the crowd loved it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=230.12s)]
*  They clapped consistent with their species. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=233.0s)]
*  Actually, sorry, that is unfair to seals. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=235.96s)]
*  There's not a seal in the ocean or even at SeaWorld who would wear an I Love Abortion pin [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=237.72s)]
*  that is too low even for marine mammals. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=242.68s)]
*  They may eat live fish, but they're not ghouls. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=245.08s)]
*  Congressional Democrats, by contrast, are ghouls. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=248.56s)]
*  Take a look at this pin, which has replaced the American flag on their lapels. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=251.24s)]
*  Notice that the O in abortion is in the shape of a heart. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=255.28s)]
*  They literally love abortion. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=259.24s)]
*  Now, let's set aside the politics and ask an honest question. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=263.24s)]
*  Who loves abortion? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=266.0s)]
*  Honestly, who loves abortion? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=267.6s)]
*  Maybe you think abortion should be legal. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=269.24s)]
*  But do you love abortion? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=271.36s)]
*  Do you think abortion is a wonderful, affirming act you feel so proud of? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=273.16s)]
*  You brag about it with jewelry? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=277.48s)]
*  If you feel that way, you should know that you are not defending a medical procedure. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  You wouldn't say that about an appendectomy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=284.88s)]
*  You are promoting an ancient religious right called human sacrifice. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  That's what this is, promoting human sacrifice. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  Let's stop lying about it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=293.88s)]
*  It's very obvious now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=295.08s)]
*  And speaking of death cults, Joe Biden made his case last night for the sexual mutilation of children. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  It's also passed the Bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=302.64s)]
*  can live with safety and dignity. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=311.08s)]
*  First, you want to say, whoa, whoa, pause, Mr. President. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=314.28s)]
*  Define every letter in the acronym and what they all mean. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=316.68s)]
*  Of course, he couldn't. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  But he is pointing to an occurring reality in our country. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=323.4s)]
*  There are hospitals in the United States, hard as it is to believe, that are right now [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=327.0s)]
*  performing mastectomies on little girls in the name of gender ideology. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=330.4s)]
*  They're castrating children and then giving them drugs that produce sterility and osteoporosis. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  And they're bragging about it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, this has happened with adults for a long time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  It's never happened at scale with children and no one's ever bragged about it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  But the Democratic Party now is not just endorsing it, not just supporting it silently by calling it an affirmative good. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=350.76s)]
*  Joe Biden, the guy who showered with his daughter, causing her to develop sexual compulsions as an adult, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=358.16s)]
*  calls the sexual mutilation of children safety and dignity. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=363.6s)]
*  That's dark, really dark. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=368.0s)]
*  But it got worse, actually. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=371.64000000000004s)]
*  The humor stopped and the darkness descended. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=373.36s)]
*  Joe Biden proceeded to talk about the recent death of Tyree Nichols in Memphis. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=375.72s)]
*  Now, you'll remember that he was killed by five police officers, all of whom were black, as was he. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=379.32000000000005s)]
*  So the takeaway from that episode may be worth knowing about, but it has nothing to do with race, at least not directly. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  Everyone was the same color. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=390.76s)]
*  And yet last night, Joe Biden used that sad episode with Tyree Nichols' family present in the room to advance the lie, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=392.92s)]
*  the one you hear so often, that the white middle class is the single greatest threat to America and especially to black people. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=406.48s)]
*  Most of us in here have never had to have the talk. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=407.72s)]
*  The talk that brown and black parents have had to have with their children. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=412.76000000000005s)]
*  Bo, Hunter, Ashley, my children. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=417.0s)]
*  I never had to have the talk with them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=419.8s)]
*  I never had to tell them if a police officer pulls you over, turn your interior lights on right away. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=422.16s)]
*  Don't reach for your license. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=429.92s)]
*  Keep your hands on the steering wheel. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=432.44000000000005s)]
*  Imagine having to worry like that every single time your kid got in a car. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=435.8s)]
*  Now, it is fair that they don't worry like that in the Biden family. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=441.92s)]
*  Both of Biden's surviving children have had run-ins with the peace police repeatedly. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  Hunter Biden left a crack pipe and his ID in a rental car, but no one ever followed up on it because he was the son of a powerful politician. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=449.48s)]
*  Maybe Joe Biden should be grateful for that, but it's not a racial issue. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=458.6s)]
*  But he's saying that it is. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=462.44s)]
*  The police, African-Americans, are trying to murder you because you're black. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=463.72s)]
*  That's unifying the country. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  Police are responsible for all the violence in black communities. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=470.48s)]
*  That's his message. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=472.88s)]
*  Now, that is not only a lie, provably a lie because reliable statistics exist. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=474.48s)]
*  It's a lie that's caused a lot of people, including a lot of black Americans, to die over the last three years because police in many places have stopped enforcing the law and in others have simply quit. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=480.16s)]
*  And they're replaced by total mediocrities and crazy violent people like the cops who beat Tyree Nichols to death in Memphis. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=489.76s)]
*  How do you think they got that job? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=496.08s)]
*  Because normal people quit. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=498.04s)]
*  That's why, because they didn't want to work in an industry that's under attack unfairly for the president of the United States. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=499.48s)]
*  And now Joe Biden is repeating that lie and on and on and on. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=506.0s)]
*  At one point, he claimed January 6th was an active insurrection and that it was an insurrectionist, not a hippie nudist with a BLM sign outside his home who attacked Paul Pelosi last year. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=510.8s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=522.0s)]
*  The last few years, our democracy has been threatened and attacked, put at risk, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  put to the test in this very room on January the 6th. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=528.68s)]
*  And then just a few months ago, an unhinged big lie, a sale and unleashed of political violence, the home of the then speaker of the House of Representatives, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=532.5999999999999s)]
*  using the very same language the insurrectionists used as they stalked these halls and chanted on January 6th. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=544.64s)]
*  The insurrectionists. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  People who were justly upset because they felt that the 2020 election was not on the level, which it was not, by the way, which it was not. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=554.08s)]
*  And we know that for a fact now that we've seen the Twitter files which prove that the big tech companies took a side in that election. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=562.6s)]
*  We didn't have a free and fair election, certainly not a free press. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=571.1600000000001s)]
*  But people who are upset about that are now insurrectionists, nonviolent protesters are insurrectionists, etc., etc., etc. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=575.12s)]
*  And the lies just kept coming. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=582.08s)]
*  To the point where it was deeply frustrating to watch. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=583.6s)]
*  At one point, Biden claimed that NATO was fighting against Putin's aggression, even though we now know, thanks to the Israeli prime minister, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=585.32s)]
*  that it was NATO, the United States, in other words, that prevented a truce from being signed between Russia and Ukraine last year. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=592.0s)]
*  As Joe Biden said that, a lie, Mitch McConnell clapped and smiled wearing his Ukraine flag tie. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=600.64s)]
*  But maybe the most egregious lie is one that affects every American. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=607.64s)]
*  Biden claimed that our economy could not be doing better because he's an economic wizard. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=610.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=616.64s)]
*  We're better positioned than any country on Earth right now. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=618.36s)]
*  But we have more to do. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  But here at home, inflation is coming down. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=623.6s)]
*  Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 from their peak. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  Food inflation is coming down, not fast enough, but coming down. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  So those were very specific claims about the economy, a lot of which is easy to measure. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-wfFZxLHRg&t=637.48s)]
