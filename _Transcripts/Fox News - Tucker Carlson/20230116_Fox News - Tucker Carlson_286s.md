# Tucker Carlson: This is very serious
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0)
*  Well, here's a really interesting story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=0.0s)]
*  So five days ago, last Wednesday, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=1.6s)]
*  the FAA ordered a ground stop on all air travel in the US. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  That meant that not a single commercial [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=6.8s)]
*  or private aircraft was allowed in the skies [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=8.5s)]
*  over this country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=10.34s)]
*  And that's very serious. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Hard to overstate the seriousness of that, actually. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=12.6s)]
*  The last, the only other time [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=15.18s)]
*  this country has imposed a national ground stop [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=16.98s)]
*  was after 9-11, the terror attacks 21 years ago. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=18.98s)]
*  So it's a huge deal. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=23.72s)]
*  Why did the government ground all the planes? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  So people ask, but initially no one seems to know. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=27.32s)]
*  Now, Pete Buttigieg, who runs the transportation department, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=29.18s)]
*  which oversees the FAA, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=31.68s)]
*  went on TV to say he was not quite sure. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=33.26s)]
*  And then over the next several hours, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=36.12s)]
*  a kind of story emerged. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=37.7s)]
*  The government system that sends messages to pilots [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=39.66s)]
*  called NoTAM had gone down. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=42.26s)]
*  And then the emergency backup system had also gone down. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=44.86s)]
*  Now, the FAA claimed it first noticed this on Tuesday night. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  When the problem could not be fixed, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=51.58s)]
*  the government issued a ground stop the next morning. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=52.8s)]
*  That's what Pete Buttigieg said. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=55.18s)]
*  He described the culprit here as, quote, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  a damaged database file with no evidence of a cyber attack. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  So to repeat, said Pete Buttigieg, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=63.9s)]
*  there was no evidence of a cyber attack. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=66.06s)]
*  It was just your garden variety software snafu. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=68.9s)]
*  Some contractor entered the wrong code, no big deal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=71.94s)]
*  That's what they said, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=76.44s)]
*  but it was not a very convincing story [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  if you thought about it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=78.52s)]
*  Shutting down all commercial air travel in this country, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=79.92s)]
*  even for a morning, is a very serious thing to do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=82.66s)]
*  The US airlines haul close to 3 quarters [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=86.24s)]
*  of a billion people every year. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=88.3s)]
*  Air travel is essential. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=90.34s)]
*  It's also potentially dangerous. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=91.64s)]
*  So for a lot of reasons, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=93.74s)]
*  it is imperative that our system works perfectly. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=94.94s)]
*  But one day our system just shut down for no real reason. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=98.24s)]
*  Is that what you're telling us? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=102.16s)]
*  Yes, explained Pete Buttigieg with a straight face. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, most people seem to think this was fine. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=107.66s)]
*  We were not entirely convinced. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=109.9s)]
*  And then the next day, last Thursday, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=112.36s)]
*  we noticed that virtually the same thing happened in Canada. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=114.58s)]
*  Well, that was very strange [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=119.48s)]
*  because the US and Canada have separate aviation authorities. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=121.26s)]
*  They're different countries. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=124.42s)]
*  And each country uses its own software to route their planes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=125.76s)]
*  The systems are not linked to each other. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=129.12s)]
*  And yet 24 hours after our country's no-tem system went down, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=131.62s)]
*  Canada's no-tem system went down also. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=135.5s)]
*  According to the Canadian government, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=139.2s)]
*  its system quote, experienced an outage. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=140.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=144.06s)]
*  What are the odds of that? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=145.34s)]
*  And then we remembered that on New Year's Day, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=147.28s)]
*  two weeks ago, something similar happened in the Philippines. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=149.1s)]
*  Its air traffic control system also went down. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=152.14s)]
*  For a time, no aircraft were allowed in Philippine airspace. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=155.72s)]
*  Thousands of flights over Asia had to be rerouted, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=158.98s)]
*  which is expensive and dangerous potentially. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  Now, this was also, they told us at the time, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  some sort of minor technical problem [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=167.32s)]
*  that we should not worry about. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=169.18s)]
*  Calm down, everything's fine. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=170.28s)]
*  But is everything fine? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=172.68s)]
*  Or is it possible that somebody is hacking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=174.4s)]
*  into aviation systems and holding various governments [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=176.94s)]
*  around the world hostage until they pay a ransom? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=180.18s)]
*  Well, yes, it's entirely possible. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=184.32s)]
*  In fact, for example, in the summer of 2020, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=187.92s)]
*  UCSF Medical School paid more than a million dollars [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=190.42s)]
*  in Bitcoin and they paid it in order to get access [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=193.5s)]
*  to their own computers, which had been frozen by hackers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=196.2s)]
*  They were held up for ransom. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=199.24s)]
*  So what if the same people or similar people [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=201.84s)]
*  just did something very much like that to the FAA [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=204.4s)]
*  and then to the government in Canada [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=208.4s)]
*  and also the government of the Philippines? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, if that were actually happening, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=212.4s)]
*  the Biden administration would never tell us [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=213.84s)]
*  in a million years, they would lie about it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=215.32s)]
*  like they lie about everything else. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=217.2s)]
*  They would have Mayor Pete claim it was a software glitch [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=218.84s)]
*  from a contractor and they would lie to us [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=221.72s)]
*  because they would not want us to know [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=224.12s)]
*  that they had been so utterly reckless and negligent [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=226.12s)]
*  and distracted by equity concerns [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=230.38s)]
*  that they had allowed some foreign hostile group [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=232.74s)]
*  to take control of our FAA. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=235.58s)]
*  But the lie could only cover so much [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=239.18s)]
*  because there would be signs of it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=241.18s)]
*  Almost all ransoms like this are paid in Bitcoin. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=243.42s)]
*  So if the US government was buying huge amounts of Bitcoin [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=246.58s)]
*  in order to pay a ransom, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=249.58s)]
*  Bitcoin prices would surge, of course. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=251.5s)]
*  So the question is, has that happened? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=254.3s)]
*  Oh yes, it has happened. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=256.7s)]
*  Since the nationwide ground stop last Thursday, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  the price of Bitcoin has shot up about 20%. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=261.92s)]
*  Is that a coincidence? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  We asked Pete Buttigieg to come on the show tonight [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=268.36s)]
*  to let us know. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=270.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, he did not respond to our request. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=271.16s)]
*  So we'll keep asking. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoPvl6iUWx0&t=273.28000000000003s)]
