# Tulsi Gabbard reveals who Biden's sanctions really punish
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA)
*  Tulsi Gabbard is one of the few people in the Democratic Party who saw this coming and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=0.0s)]
*  was excoriated for it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=3.54s)]
*  She's a former congressman from Hawaii. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  So I'm just trying to think, because I think it's a fair question as an American, what's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=9.52s)]
*  in this for me and my neighbors and the rest of us? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=12.66s)]
*  And all I'm getting is that we can feel morally satisfied because we hate Putin. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=16.5s)]
*  Is there something that I'm missing? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=21.82s)]
*  No, I don't think you're missing anything. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=24.02s)]
*  The reality is that these sanctions don't work, whether they were put in before or now [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=27.2s)]
*  or later. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=31.86s)]
*  These sanctions don't work. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=33.34s)]
*  What we do know is that they will increase suffering and hardship for the American people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=34.58s)]
*  And this is the whole problem with the Biden administration. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=39.38s)]
*  They are so focused on how do we punish Putin that they don't care and are not focused [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=42.16s)]
*  on what is actually in the best interests of the American people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=47.84s)]
*  So when Biden stands there and looks directly into the camera and says, you know, defending [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=52.14s)]
*  freedom will cost us, what he really should be saying is looking directly into the American [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=56.6s)]
*  people's eyes and saying, this will cost you because these sanctions are not going [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  to cost him or Kamala Harris or the power elite in this country, even the power elite [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=67.10000000000001s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=72.68s)]
*  It is the people who will suffer, the American people, the Russian people, people here at [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=73.68s)]
*  home working hard every single day facing those drastically increasing prices at the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=77.76s)]
*  gas pump, facing increasing costs at the supermarket, impacting our supply chain, the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=83.24s)]
*  hardships that people are dealing with every day now with Biden sanctions plan. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=88.64s)]
*  We're only going to see that continuing to get worse. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=93.64s)]
*  And it doesn't end there, Tucker. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=95.88s)]
*  This is the problem is you think Russia is not going to respond. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=97.22s)]
*  You think Putin's not going to respond. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=100.0s)]
*  He will respond. And it's likely he'll retaliate using cyber attacks on our financial [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=101.24s)]
*  systems, our communication systems, on our basic infrastructure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=106.24s)]
*  Biden will then be forced to respond. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=110.88s)]
*  Putin will then be forced to respond. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=112.88s)]
*  So we end up in this endless tit for tat that leads us where? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=114.04s)]
*  To this looming threat and likelihood of this thing going nuclear. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=118.0s)]
*  And again, this is the reality that we all need to understand is true, is that whether [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=123.76s)]
*  it is intentional or unintentional, when you have two great nuclear armed countries at [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=128.36s)]
*  this point of escalation and then if there is a nuclear attack, the power elite, these [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=134.12s)]
*  people are going to go hide in their bunkers. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=139.52s)]
*  They'll they'll have their shelter. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=141.24s)]
*  They'll have their food and water and everything that they need. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=142.56s)]
*  You and I and the American people, we will be left out to deal with the consequences, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  to suffer and deal with that destruction and death that will come as a result. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  And yet we're doing this for principle. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=155.28s)]
*  The people in charge who don't care at all about our founding documents, who violate [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=157.28s)]
*  their spirit and letter every day, are telling us that an essential American principle is [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  this thing. Do you have any idea what that principle might be? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  That therein lies the hypocrisy, Tucker, as they're saying we're doing this in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=167.24s)]
*  the defense of freedom, in the defense of democracy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  But these are the very same people who are working to undermine our own freedoms and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=175.72s)]
*  our own democracy right here at home. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  I have a hard time seeing how they actually say these things with a straight face to the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=182.8s)]
*  American people when they clearly don't care about these principles right here at [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=186.88s)]
*  home. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  They don't care about defending them. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  They don't care about the well-being of the American people. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  I think that's all very clear. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=195.72s)]
*  And I appreciate your saying it as clearly as you did. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=197.4s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, joining us tonight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=200.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=201.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=202.48s)]
*  It's interesting when people tell you who you're required to be mad at. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=205.48s)]
*  You've got a right to think for yourself. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=209.2s)]
*  You should be mad at the people who are making your life worse, who are preventing you from [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=210.64s)]
*  saying what you think is true, who are calling you a racist for no justification, only to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=213.92s)]
*  hurt you, who are destroying your children's education, who are allowing your country to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=218.8s)]
*  become polluted and overrun and filled with drugs and the homeless. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=222.52s)]
*  Maybe you should be mad at them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6AsFCm_ACA&t=226.4s)]
