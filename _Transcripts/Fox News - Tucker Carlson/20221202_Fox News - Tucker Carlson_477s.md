# Tucker Carlson: Twitter was permanently censoring users at the request of the DNC and Biden campaign
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw)
*  Welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. This is a Fox News Alert. One of the most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=0.0s)]
*  extraordinary moments in the history of social media is unfolding right now as [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=3.74s)]
*  we speak and it began when Elon Musk took control of Twitter. When he bought [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=8.66s)]
*  the company he promised to reveal its corruption, the extent to which Twitter [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=13.9s)]
*  had engaged in politically motivated censorship, including the unlawful, the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  illegal censorship of American citizens at the direction of the US government. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=23.34s)]
*  Well tonight, less than an hour ago, Musk began to make good on that promise. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=28.900000000000002s)]
*  Twitter shared a trove of internal documents with Matt Taibbi of Substack. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=33.02s)]
*  Those documents are coming out again as we speak and what they prove so far is [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  very serious. Those documents show a systemic violation of the First Amendment, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=42.3s)]
*  the largest example of that in modern history. These documents show that among [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=47.18s)]
*  other things, political officials in the Democratic National Committee were [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=52.22s)]
*  directing censorship at Twitter ahead of the 2020 election. One Twitter official [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=55.7s)]
*  wrote on October 24th, 2020 that he had received quote, an additional report from [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=62.82s)]
*  the DNC. So the DNC was telling Twitter what to pull off the site and Twitter was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=67.18s)]
*  complying. Next morning, to prove it, a Twitter official confirmed the post had [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=72.5s)]
*  been deleted. I grabbed the first one, that Twitter employee wrote. Twitter was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=76.66s)]
*  also following instructions directly from the Biden campaign in the final [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=81.5s)]
*  days of the presidential campaign. One of the documents proves that officials on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=85.38s)]
*  the Biden team routinely directed Twitter to remove posts that reflected [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=90.42s)]
*  poorly on Joe Biden. Quote, more to review from the Biden team, read one [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=94.74s)]
*  internal email from a Twitter employee just days before the 2020 election. That [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=99.34s)]
*  email included a list of several Twitter accounts that had criticized Joe Biden. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=103.62s)]
*  The reply, quote, handled. We just checked. Now those accounts remain [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=107.38s)]
*  suspended today. So Twitter was permanently censoring users at the request [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=113.3s)]
*  of the DNC and the Biden campaign. That is new. Many suspected it. Now it has [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=119.06s)]
*  been absolutely confirmed by internal documents. And of course, the New York [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=124.02s)]
*  Post Twitter account was banned. Why? Because they had a story that might have [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=127.46s)]
*  changed the outcome of the 2020 election and Twitter knew that perfectly well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=131.78s)]
*  They had accurate information about Hunter Biden's laptop. The post [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=135.82s)]
*  reporting directly implicated Joe Biden and the Biden family in an ongoing scheme [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=140.14s)]
*  to sell influence, to leverage Biden's job as a government official, to sell the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  prestige and the power of the U.S. government to China and Ukraine. That [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=149.22s)]
*  scheme, that ongoing scheme that unfolded over years, made the Biden family [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=154.5s)]
*  millions of dollars. 10% of that money was reserved, as you know, for the big [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  guy, meaning Joe Biden. So that was information that might have changed the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=162.42s)]
*  outcome of the election. And that is precisely why Twitter prevented its users [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  from reading it. Twitter went so far as to block its users from privately sharing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=171.98s)]
*  the New York Post story on Twitter Direct Message. So anyone attempting to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=176.98s)]
*  share the story about Hunter Biden's laptop was told it was unsafe. Now that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=181.14s)]
*  measure preventing users from sharing information privately is something that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=186.42s)]
*  Twitter reserves in normal circumstances only in the most extreme cases, Tai B [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=190.62s)]
*  rights, like stopping the transmission of child pornography. But in this case, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=194.7s)]
*  information that might have hurt Joe Biden's chances of becoming president were [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=199.82s)]
*  invoked. And they were applied even to the sitting president's press secretary, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=203.66s)]
*  Kayleigh McEnany. Internally, Tai B writes, quote, the decision was made at [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=207.78s)]
*  the highest levels of the company, but without the knowledge of CEO Jack Dorsey, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=212.33999999999997s)]
*  with former head of legal policy and trust, Vijaya Gaudi, playing a key role. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=217.17999999999998s)]
*  All suspected now confirmed. Now in public, Twitter and its many allies and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=222.38000000000002s)]
*  the rest of the media claimed that the New York Post story violated the hacked [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=228.46s)]
*  materials policy that Twitter had on its books. But internally at Twitter, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=232.58s)]
*  everyone understood that was just a pretext. The laptop had not been hacked [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  and it wasn't of Russian origin. And by the way, as of right now, it's 804 [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=240.86s)]
*  Eastern time, there is no evidence in this ongoing thread for Matt Tai B that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=244.82000000000002s)]
*  Twitter had received confirmation from the US government even that the laptop [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=249.22s)]
*  was fake or from Russia. They just made it up. According to Tai B, one official [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  admitted that, quote, hacking was the excuse, but within a few hours, pretty [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=260.62s)]
*  much everyone at Twitter realized that wasn't going to hold, but no one had the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=264.86s)]
*  guts to reverse it. One communications official at Twitter, Trenton Kennedy, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  wrote this, quote, I'm struggling to understand the policy basis for marking [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=272.74s)]
*  this, the laptop story, as unsafe. Twitter's former head of trust and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=276.26s)]
*  safety, UL Roth, explained that Twitter had to censor the story so that Donald [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=279.34s)]
*  Trump would not be reelected president. Quote, the policy basis is hacked [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  material, though, as discussed, this is an emerging situation where the facts [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=290.5s)]
*  remain unclear. Given the severe risks here and the lessons of 2016, meaning [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=295.78s)]
*  Trump could get elected, we're erring on the side of including a warning and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=302.82s)]
*  preventing this content from being amplified. Now, this played out to some [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=308.02s)]
*  extent in public. Now we know what was happening within Twitter, but the whole [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=314.58s)]
*  country knew that something was being censored. A lot of people couldn't read [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=318.34s)]
*  it, but it was widely known that Twitter was censoring this, and so, by the way, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=323.41999999999996s)]
*  were many other news organizations. And at that time, Twitter received a [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=326.78s)]
*  communication from a consultant in Washington who had taken an informal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=330.78s)]
*  poll of members of Congress, Democrats. And the message this person sent to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  Twitter was, Democrats in Congress support the censorship, and were quoting, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=338.73999999999995s)]
*  they don't think the First Amendment is absolute. In other words, sitting members [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=342.85999999999996s)]
*  of Congress were encouraging censorship to affect the outcome of a presidential [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=349.14s)]
*  election. That is illegal, it is effectively election rigging, and it is a [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  direct attack on our Bill of Rights by people who have sworn to uphold the Bill [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=358.14s)]
*  of Rights. You gotta hope someone will be held accountable for this. So back to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=362.94s)]
*  the documents. Within Twitter, others, presumably all voting Democrats, but [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=368.02s)]
*  some with some integrity, kept raising questions about this. Former Vice [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=372.82s)]
*  President of Global Communications Brandon Borman asked, quote, can we [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=376.97999999999996s)]
*  truthfully claim this is part of the policy? In other words, is this [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=379.62s)]
*  consistent with the rules? Then the General Counsel of Twitter, Jim Baker, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=384.58s)]
*  that would be the former FBI General Counsel, who was directly involved in the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=389.41999999999996s)]
*  FBI's interview with Michael Flynn when his life was destroyed for political [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=393.46s)]
*  reasons, signed off on the continued censorship. The former FBI official signed [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=397.34s)]
*  off. Quote, caution is warranted, said Baker. Let's hope we hear from Mr. Baker [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=402.5s)]
*  in a congressional hearing very soon. So throughout all of this, the record shows, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=408.97999999999996s)]
*  at least as of right now, only one elected official in the entire Democratic [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=413.3s)]
*  Party, that would be Ro Khanna of Silicon Valley, a Democrat, voicing any [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=417.9s)]
*  concern at all. So Khanna reached out to Vijay Aghadi, and here's what he wrote. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  This seems to be a violation of the First Amendment principles. And I say [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=428.06s)]
*  this as a total Biden partisan. But he was completely blown off by Vijay Aghadi. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=431.78s)]
*  By the way, good for him. He's a liberal, too, but apparently sort of a real one. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=437.78s)]
*  Within days, someone called Carl Sabo, with the research from NetChoice, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=442.94s)]
*  advised Twitter executives that on Capitol Hill, Democrats were very happy [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=446.26s)]
*  with this. They supported the censorship. So as we said, this thread exposing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=451.26s)]
*  internal documents from Twitter, as transcribed with commentary by Matt [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=456.82s)]
*  Taibbi, is still ongoing. It is still flowing forth as we speak, and we'll [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=460.46s)]
*  bring you new information as it comes. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=465.18s)]
*  are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=472.38s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzc7o1zdhYw&t=475.34s)]
