# Canadian trucker calls out 'stifling of freedom' in Canada
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI)
*  So up in Canada, the convoy of truckers converging on Ottawa to keep that nation free is going [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=0.0s)]
*  larger by the day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=5.46s)]
*  They left from Vancouver on the western side of the country on Sunday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=7.08s)]
*  They're protesting the federal government's vaccine mandates for cross-border truckers, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=10.92s)]
*  among other things. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  That mandate took effect on January 15th, preparatory to a worldwide digital travel [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=15.46s)]
*  pass, internal passports for everybody linked to your health status, but not limited to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  your health status. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=25.12s)]
*  If you can't see the future in clear outline right now, you're not paying attention. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=26.38s)]
*  But the truckers in Canada can. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=30.7s)]
*  The Canadian Trucking Alliance estimates that roughly 16,000 truckers in Canada are not [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=32.58s)]
*  vaccinated. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=37.78s)]
*  That convoy also includes truckers who are vaccinated, but who aren't going to stand [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=38.78s)]
*  for tyranny. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=42.26s)]
*  Here's what the convoy looks like. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=43.26s)]
*  This started with vaccine mandates, but for most here, it's about a lot more. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  I think this is more of a freedom movement. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=50.78s)]
*  All over a thousand people lining the Trans-Canada Highway outside of Winnipeg in minus 30 windchills, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=54.02s)]
*  protesting what they call government overreach. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=60.38s)]
*  Somebody has to stand up for Canada and the truckers are doing it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=63.38s)]
*  It all started a couple days ago in Delta, BC. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=66.54s)]
*  Truckers protesting vaccine mandates at the border. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=69.7s)]
*  Now as the convoy logs more kilometres, it's getting more support. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=72.62s)]
*  We're just really tired of getting our freedoms trampled on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=76.94s)]
*  It's worth sticking up for what you believe in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  Arriving outside Winnipeg, hundreds of vehicles taking more than an hour to pass. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=83.86s)]
*  We came from Calgary. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  What do you think of this? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  We think it's time to take our country back. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  As it rambled by, no one was hit. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=95.06s)]
*  It was peaceful. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=97.3s)]
*  Salvatore Vettro has followed since BC. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=98.42s)]
*  It's a togetherness like I've never felt before. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=101.58s)]
*  And it keeps growing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=104.9s)]
*  And thank God it keeps growing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=105.9s)]
*  So what's the reaction been like from our media gatekeepers? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  Well, a cartoonist for the Washington Post accused the truck drivers of fascism. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=112.58s)]
*  There's the cartoon on your screen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=117.9s)]
*  So a paid vassal for the world's richest man, a man who supports censorship and crushing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=119.1s)]
*  anyone who doesn't agree with him, who treats his own legions of workers like serfs. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=124.74s)]
*  A guy who works for that man is telling you that people who peacefully assemble to express [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=130.94s)]
*  political opinions are, quote, fascists. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=134.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=136.46s)]
*  Who's the fascist? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=137.46s)]
*  How? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=138.46s)]
*  Sheldon Andreas is not a fascist. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=139.46s)]
*  He's a pastor. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=141.38s)]
*  He's also a trucker. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=142.38s)]
*  He's a member of the Freedom Convoy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=143.38s)]
*  And we're grateful to have him join us tonight from Ontario. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=144.38s)]
*  Mr. Andreas, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=146.46s)]
*  A fascist, really. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  So tell us why you're doing this, if you would. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=151.74s)]
*  Yeah, well, probably mostly for the same reasons that a lot of these other guys are out here [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=154.38s)]
*  doing this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=160.38s)]
*  There's just been a stifling of freedom and a stifling of unity in Canada for two years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=161.94s)]
*  A lot of people are down. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=170.06s)]
*  A lot of people are fired. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  Man, you can't even go into a grocery store without getting into an argument about a mask [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=173.78s)]
*  or whatnot. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=179.62s)]
*  So what really drove me to do this is the smiling faces that I've seen on the people [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=181.46s)]
*  that organized it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  A good friend of mine helped to put this together, and it's just been wonderful to see all the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=190.02s)]
*  smiling faces that have come together. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  Christians, non-Christians, all sorts. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  The natives are out banging their drums. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=202.5s)]
*  Just a wonderful sensation to see unity once again in Canada. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's beautiful to watch from below your border, I have to say. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=208.98s)]
*  You're being snarled at, but you're smiling back. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=213.61999999999998s)]
*  The government seems to be doing all it can to prevent you from peacefully protesting [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=217.14s)]
*  its, speaking of fascist, policies. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=221.5s)]
*  But you're doing it anyway. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=224.98s)]
*  Are you worried about the repercussions? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=225.98s)]
*  Oh, not at all. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=228.26s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=229.61999999999998s)]
*  I mean, some of my friends have been arrested for pastoring their churches. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=230.61999999999998s)]
*  We're fully prepared to smile and push through for the greater good, Tucker. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=233.66s)]
*  We want to see Christ glorified in the church and out of the church. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  So we're pushing forward. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=243.82s)]
*  Come with me. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=244.82s)]
*  So why are you, I shouldn't even pose this to you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=245.82s)]
*  Let me just say, you seem much more like a civil rights hero than a fascist to me. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=248.94s)]
*  Are any media in Canada supporting you or at least arguing that you should have a right [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=254.16s)]
*  to express your views? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=258.48s)]
*  Yeah, not that I know of, Tucker. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=259.96s)]
*  I think maybe Rebel News is putting out some positive stuff about the movement. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=261.8s)]
*  But the mainline media is much the same in the USA. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=267.32s)]
*  These guys are not our friends. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=271.76s)]
*  They're coming after us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=274.62s)]
*  They're slandering really good people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  Some of the stuff they're saying about really good people dragging their names through the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=278.8s)]
*  mud, it's shameful. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=281.88s)]
*  No fascists here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=284.36s)]
*  Moms and dads and kids standing around a bonfire beside me where the convoy came through here [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=285.64s)]
*  about half an hour ago. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=290.68s)]
*  Standing here with their kids and join a fire with people they haven't got to hang out with [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=294.76s)]
*  for a very long time. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=300.48s)]
*  I gotta say, it's just so thrilling to see this, having watched Canada, such a beautiful [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=302.52s)]
*  country, a wonderful country, descend into this darkness and to see someone like you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=306.48s)]
*  standing up cheerfully is really affirming. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=311.32s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=314.48s)]
*  Sheldon Andreas, good luck. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=315.48s)]
*  Yeah, you're welcome, Tucker. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=316.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjMCEZxtawI&t=318.08s)]
