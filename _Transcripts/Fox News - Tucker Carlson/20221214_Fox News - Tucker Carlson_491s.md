# Mike Tyson on wanting to 'kill' his opponents in the ring, living with tigers
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE)
*  I showed you the first part of our conversation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=0.0s)]
*  with Mike Tyson last night, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=1.68s)]
*  one of the most interesting interviews we've ever done, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=3.52s)]
*  but it got even better. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=6.72s)]
*  Mike Tyson, it turns out, doesn't just love animals. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=8.32s)]
*  He watches them really carefully and has learned a lot. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=11.44s)]
*  He told us what it's like to live [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  with two tigers on his bed, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  and he told us how he felt about the men [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=17.18s)]
*  he faced off against in the ring. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=19.44s)]
*  Here's a hint, he wanted to kill them, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=22.16s)]
*  and he really meant it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=24.04s)]
*  Here's part of the second half of our conversation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=25.72s)]
*  with Mike Tyson from Tucker Carlson Today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=28.24s)]
*  ["Tucker Carlson's Theme Song"] [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=30.2s)]
*  How did you feel about the guys you were in the ring with? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=34.58s)]
*  I wanted to kill them. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, I can tell. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=39.12s)]
*  Why did, I'm laughing nervously, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=42.839999999999996s)]
*  you really felt that way? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=48.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=49.64s)]
*  How did you get yourself into a frame of mind [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=51.86s)]
*  where you wanted to kill them? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  I just think about who I am. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=56.36s)]
*  I don't want to go back there no more. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=57.52s)]
*  I don't want to be in that poverty state of mind anymore, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=58.84s)]
*  and not from a physical perspective. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to be poverty struck in here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=64.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  So would you sit and think about it before a fight? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  Think about the guy you were fighting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=71.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=74.08s)]
*  The more you hurt them, the higher you go in life. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=75.36s)]
*  That's just my mentality. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=80.0s)]
*  The more you hurt them, the more people love you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=82.0s)]
*  Wow, that's pretty intense. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=85.5s)]
*  And true, I guess. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=87.18s)]
*  So when you knocked him out, you were satisfied, happy? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=90.42s)]
*  Oh, I don't even want to say, yeah, kind of, yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=93.42s)]
*  What don't you want to say? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=97.42s)]
*  It wasn't good enough. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=98.9s)]
*  At that time in my life, it wasn't good enough. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=101.66s)]
*  You wanted to keep going? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=105.1s)]
*  My tone was, yeah, I wanted to crush his spirit. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=105.94s)]
*  I wanted him to have everything he could be. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=108.14s)]
*  Fear is like fire. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=110.18s)]
*  If you know how to control it, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=111.94s)]
*  it keeps us all warm. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=113.42s)]
*  It feeds our food and everything. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=114.62s)]
*  But if you let it get out of control, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=117.86s)]
*  it'll destroy you and everything around you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=119.62s)]
*  That's such a smart point. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=121.9s)]
*  How do you keep it in this box [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=123.58s)]
*  where it's the nuclear reactor that fuels you, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=126.14s)]
*  but it's not the forest fire that- [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=128.1s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=130.02s)]
*  I was programmed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  I could be in a room with a bunch of really bad, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=133.26s)]
*  or you may consider bad, but very interesting people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=136.06s)]
*  that I maybe shouldn't be able to leave that room. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=138.62s)]
*  But it's just my projection of how I feel, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=142.62s)]
*  and I projected it with everyone else. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=144.82s)]
*  Have you, in the years since those fights, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=148.74s)]
*  have you stayed in touch with any of the guys you fought? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=151.78s)]
*  Holyfield. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  Holyfield. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=157.86s)]
*  We're business partners. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=160.38s)]
*  And the THC gummy business. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  And all the marijuana stuff, pretty much. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=164.74s)]
*  We're getting ready to do, what are we doing? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=167.34s)]
*  The bites, Mike bites, the part of Holyfield's ear [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  that was missing, we're getting ready to come out with that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  And we've been very successful with that, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  and I'm so happy that he's gonna, this is what I say. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=178.22s)]
*  All right, listen to this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  We're the only fighters in the history of the world [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  that's still getting paid from a fight 25 years ago. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=184.33999999999997s)]
*  No, that's true. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=187.1s)]
*  Who's doing that? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=188.42s)]
*  Do you still have tigers? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=189.78s)]
*  No, I have little kids. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=191.1s)]
*  If I didn't have kids with just me and her, we would. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=192.62s)]
*  So when your kids get older, you're gonna have tigers again? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=195.33999999999997s)]
*  No, I'm not gonna be Armstrong, Mr. Handle. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=197.33999999999997s)]
*  You gotta be tough with them sometimes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=201.06s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=202.82s)]
*  Yeah, they understand. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=203.94s)]
*  Listen, not the tigers as much, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=205.18s)]
*  because they get offended, they get depressed [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=208.34s)]
*  when you reprimand them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=211.22s)]
*  But lions are like dogs. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=212.66s)]
*  Hey, sick of him. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  Hey, get over here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=215.54s)]
*  Just like dogs. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=216.74s)]
*  Cheetahs too, cheetahs are more dogs, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=218.58s)]
*  because cheetahs bark. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  They don't growl, they cast a purr, they bite, they bark. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=220.82s)]
*  So some cats are in the dog family. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=225.1s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=228.66s)]
*  So a cheetah behaves like a dog? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=229.62s)]
*  If they're a cheetah and a lion, tigers not so, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=231.66s)]
*  but you can tell them what to do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=235.38s)]
*  And they attack somebody, they jump on you, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=236.66s)]
*  they come and chill out with you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=239.46s)]
*  Tigers are not like that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=241.22s)]
*  They just wanna hang out with you alone. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=242.22s)]
*  They don't wanna be friends with no one else. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  Is it dangerous to have friends over when you got tigers? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=246.18s)]
*  I normally don't have them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=248.5s)]
*  I have them in the cage when the friends come over. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=249.34s)]
*  So you're saying as you get older [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=253.58s)]
*  and you become less aggressive, the cats can smell that? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=257.18s)]
*  Yeah, they know, listen, they have to be put in their place. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=261.22s)]
*  The tiger knows he has to be put in his place. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=263.42s)]
*  And if you're not able to put him in his place, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=265.54s)]
*  he's gonna put you in your place. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=267.06s)]
*  So you gotta be the custom auto to his mic. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=268.86s)]
*  Absolutely, and it doesn't have to be brutal. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=270.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=273.06s)]
*  Doesn't have to be brutal. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=273.9s)]
*  Listen, you can teach these cats, right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=274.74s)]
*  You can teach them, but very few, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=277.9s)]
*  like only half a percent could be trained. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=279.98s)]
*  You can't tame them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=284.26s)]
*  You can train them, but you can't tame them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=285.26s)]
*  Probably half a percent. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=287.86s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=288.86s)]
*  Well, if you train them, they do tricks for you, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=290.18s)]
*  you hang out with them, they do this, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=292.82s)]
*  and then you gotta put them away. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=294.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=295.74s)]
*  But when you have them raise, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=296.58s)]
*  they're sleeping in the bed with you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=298.46s)]
*  You can do that? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=300.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=301.78s)]
*  Right, yeah, but I didn't have lions, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=302.9s)]
*  but I had tigers in my bed, and I had two of them in the bed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=304.18s)]
*  That's why they don't go well together. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=306.62s)]
*  You're in the bed, they wanna get close, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=308.38s)]
*  and they think you got two 400 pound cats fighting you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=309.74s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=312.62s)]
*  You're trying to roll to the floor, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=314.06s)]
*  you roll on the floor, and they're fighting on the bed, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=315.34s)]
*  because they wanna get close to you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=318.18s)]
*  Once they get close, they start fighting. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=319.22s)]
*  How do you break up a tiger fight? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=321.54s)]
*  I don't, you know what I mean? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=322.74s)]
*  Just one beast out of the other one, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=323.74s)]
*  then he runs to me, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=324.98s)]
*  the other one tries to get behind me, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=325.82s)]
*  and this guy comes, ah, shit, I gotta fight the guy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=326.94s)]
*  It's like three in the morning in your bedroom? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=329.98s)]
*  They start fighting, what the fuck? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=333.78s)]
*  I don't think I can handle that level of drama. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=336.18s)]
*  I don't think I could either, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=339.58s)]
*  nothing happened to me before. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=340.9s)]
*  I used to have them since they're first born, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=343.1s)]
*  they slept with me, hanging out with me, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=344.62s)]
*  and this never happened before. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=346.18s)]
*  Never had, never thought about bringing them up, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=348.7s)]
*  they come upstairs, they hang out, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=350.74s)]
*  but listen, if they ever fart, I get up, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=353.06s)]
*  they leave, oh listen, the whole house you have to leave. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=355.46s)]
*  Yeah, they fart, oh God. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=358.98s)]
*  Holy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=362.3s)]
*  I have to get the whole house flushed out, man. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=364.86s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=368.62s)]
*  Oh, it's so, oh man, you think somebody [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=369.7s)]
*  do the nuclear bomb on you or something, man? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  You can't breathe. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=375.97999999999996s)]
*  Oh, the musk. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=376.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=378.02s)]
*  Ooh, they're spraying that stuff everywhere. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=379.34s)]
*  Listen, and if you're not careful, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=381.65999999999997s)]
*  sometimes they do this to you, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=383.94s)]
*  and then they walk by, pow, they hit you with a piss. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=386.26s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=389.17999999999995s)]

*  Out of contempt or love, or why do they do that? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=392.74s)]
*  Sometimes you piss them off, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=395.5s)]
*  sometimes they're doing jokes on you, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=397.46s)]
*  and they piss on you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=399.7s)]
*  They just walk by and they rub up to you, rub, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  get your face licked and they walk, pow, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=402.82s)]
*  and it comes from the back, and then it comes out. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't go like, they come up, drop down, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=407.21999999999997s)]

*  Did you ever worry you were gonna get bitten? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=450.18s)]
*  I should have been, but my ego told me [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=452.98s)]
*  I got these big mothers under control. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=455.7s)]
*  I dared them to talk to me and try to jump on me. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UsNdPXhWE&t=457.74s)]
