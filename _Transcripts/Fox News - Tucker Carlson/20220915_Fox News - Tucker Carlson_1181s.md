# Tucker Carlson: This will destroy the US over time
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, finally a happy story for once. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=2.5s)]
*  Outbursts of irrepressible joy erupted [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=4.96s)]
*  throughout the exclusive island community [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=7.76s)]
*  of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts last night. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=9.52s)]
*  For hundreds of years, Martha's Vineyard had suffered [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=12.36s)]
*  from the soul crushing effects of its own whiteness. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=14.72s)]
*  Island residents understood there was only one cure. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=17.86s)]
*  They badly needed diversity. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=20.32s)]
*  In fact, they often said so. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=21.8s)]
*  But despite their very best efforts over many years, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=23.68s)]
*  diversity never came to Martha's Vineyard. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=25.96s)]
*  It was tragic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=28.16s)]
*  Imagine an 18th century British frigate adrift [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=29.34s)]
*  on the high seas with no limes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=32.38s)]
*  Sailors slowly going mad, convulsing, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  dying excruciating deaths from scurvy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=37.54s)]
*  That was Martha's Vineyard. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=40.42s)]
*  Except it wasn't lime juice they lacked. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=42.06s)]
*  They had plenty of that because you can't make [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  a gin and tonic without it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=45.38s)]
*  What Martha's Vineyard lacked was diversity, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  which is to say strength. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=49.08s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard was a very weak place. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=50.82s)]
*  As of yesterday morning, that island was 89% white, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=53.06s)]
*  monochromatic and utterly homogenous. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=57.38s)]
*  Nearly everybody there was a rich Democrat. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  80% voted for Joe Biden. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=62.14s)]
*  The median home price was over a million dollars. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  And then in a single blessed moment, everything changed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=66.66s)]
*  Relief arrived from an unlikely source. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=70.22s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=72.7s)]
*  having made his own state of paradise, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=74.18s)]
*  decided to help other states desperately in need. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=75.86s)]
*  So yesterday, DeSantis sent 50 illegal aliens, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=78.6s)]
*  most of them from Venezuela, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=81.1s)]
*  to the Martha's Vineyard airport. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=82.62s)]
*  They traveled from San Antonio to the Florida Panhandle [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=84.5s)]
*  and filing to their new home on Martha's Vineyard. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=86.86s)]
*  CBS Boston reports that after landing, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=89.62s)]
*  the group wandered about three and a half miles [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=91.68s)]
*  from the airport into town, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=93.82s)]
*  thereby instantly improving it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=95.62s)]
*  You can imagine the unrestrained jubilation [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=98.18s)]
*  on Martha's Vineyard tonight. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=101.1s)]
*  Long-suffering islanders finally rescued [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=102.98s)]
*  from their own oppressive whiteness. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=105.1s)]
*  In fact, let's go there now to check in on the celebrations. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=106.62s)]
*  Well, that's not expected. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=109.7s)]
*  Obviously there's been a mistake. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=126.74s)]
*  Nor, our producers are telling us [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=128.1s)]
*  there are no technical problems. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=129.86s)]
*  That is in fact a live shot [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=131.0s)]
*  from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts right now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=132.48s)]
*  But where were the weeping, joyful crowds? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=135.5s)]
*  Where was the champagne and the ticker tape? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=138.32s)]
*  We expected Times Square and VJ Day. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=140.06s)]
*  What we got was a cemetery at midnight. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=143.04s)]
*  What? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  But maybe it's not so confusing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=146.88s)]
*  Maybe things aren't as they seem. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=149.06s)]
*  Our first clue is Barack Obama. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=150.26s)]
*  Barack Obama is a part-time resident of Martha's Vineyard. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=152.66s)]
*  Obama is also, of course, as you know, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=155.38s)]
*  the country's greatest proponent of diversity. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=157.34s)]
*  For years, Obama earnestly told us [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  that immigrants were better than Americans. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=161.9s)]
*  They were holy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=164.82s)]
*  They make our country strong. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=165.94s)]
*  America is and always has been a nation of immigrants. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=168.34s)]
*  Throughout our history, immigrants have come to our shores [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=173.34s)]
*  in wave after wave from every corner of the globe. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=175.94s)]
*  Every one of us, unless we're Native American, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=181.18s)]
*  has an ancestor who was born somewhere else. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  That's what makes America special. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=186.18s)]
*  That's what makes us strong. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=188.06s)]
*  The basic idea of welcoming immigrants to our shores [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=189.98s)]
*  is central to our way of life. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=193.22s)]
*  It is in our DNA. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=194.62s)]
*  So that was basically the whole presidency right there [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=196.7s)]
*  for eight years, Obama hectoring us about diversity. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=199.22s)]
*  But he didn't just talk about it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  He spent his two years in office making certain [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=204.26s)]
*  that places like Des Moines, Iowa and Portland, Maine [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=206.18s)]
*  became much less white than they previously had been [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=208.66s)]
*  because as he so often told us, whiteness is bad. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=211.7s)]
*  It's a disease. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=214.22s)]
*  So we recall being a little confused [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=215.82s)]
*  when we read that Barack Obama had spent $12 million [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=217.62s)]
*  to buy an eight-bathroom oceanfront property [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=220.38s)]
*  on Martha's Vineyard, which is one of the whitest places [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=222.4s)]
*  on earth, really Martha's Vineyard? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=225.72s)]
*  Why not Baltimore or Gary, Indiana? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=228.14s)]
*  Is there really no real estate left in Detroit [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=230.42s)]
*  for the Obama family compound? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=232.32s)]
*  There's gotta be. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=233.7s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=235.4s)]
*  We didn't know. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=236.4s)]
*  And then in 2019, Michelle Obama explained it to us. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=237.78s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=240.86s)]
*  We grew up in the period, as I write, called white flight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=242.22s)]
*  That is families like ours, upstanding families like ours, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=246.52s)]
*  who were doing everything we were supposed to do and better. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=250.94s)]
*  As we moved in, white folks moved out [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  because they were afraid of what our families represented. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=259.0s)]
*  And I always stop there when I talk about this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=263.0s)]
*  out in the world because I want to remind white folks [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  that y'all were running from us and you're still running [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=270.08s)]
*  because we're no different than the immigrant families [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=275.0s)]
*  that are moving in, the families in Pilsen, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=277.92s)]
*  the families that are coming from other places [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=280.0s)]
*  to try to do better. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=283.34s)]
*  And so yeah, I feel a sense of injustice. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=285.18s)]
*  So there she was reminding white folks, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=289.46s)]
*  who badly needed reminding, that the Obamas are, quote, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=292.32s)]
*  no different from the immigrant families moving in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=294.42s)]
*  because white people hate them too. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=296.54s)]
*  They're still running, as she just said. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=297.82s)]
*  So that explained it to us. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=299.92s)]
*  The Obamas were in fact despised immigrants. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=301.3s)]
*  So when they moved to a $12 million seaside compound [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=304.28s)]
*  on Martha's Vineyard, the point is not to live in luxury [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=307.7s)]
*  with other rich people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=309.9s)]
*  No, obviously the point is to diversify Martha's Vineyard, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=310.82s)]
*  to strike a blow for justice. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  That made sense to us and we felt better. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=317.14s)]
*  But then last night happened and we started to rethink [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=319.74s)]
*  our assumptions about the Obamas, about a lot of things, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=322.06s)]
*  because a plane load of highly diverse immigrants arrived [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=324.92s)]
*  on Martha's Vineyard to join the Obamas, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=327.86s)]
*  but the Obamas didn't welcome them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=329.58000000000004s)]
*  There was not a word from Barack or Michelle Obama. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=332.54s)]
*  Barack wasn't waiting at the airport to greet [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=335.94s)]
*  the diversifiers with flowers. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=337.88s)]
*  He didn't issue a statement of congratulations. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=339.82s)]
*  He didn't invite a single Venezuelan to his home. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=341.88s)]
*  How come? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=346.04s)]
*  Could it be that Barack Obama isn't really, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=347.68s)]
*  actually in real life in favor of diversity at all? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=350.8s)]
*  Could it be that Barack Obama strongly prefers [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=354.56s)]
*  blonde soul cycle moms in Lululemon [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  to sweaty third world campesinos in dirty work pants? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=358.84s)]
*  Could it be? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=361.96s)]
*  We can't say. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=362.8s)]
*  But we can tell you that if you want to find out [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=364.14s)]
*  what people really think, go ahead and ignore what they say [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  and watch how they live. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=368.52s)]
*  And by that measure, the one that matters, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=370.9s)]
*  Barack and Michelle Obama are every bit as bigoted [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=372.53999999999996s)]
*  as any board member in any restricted country club [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  in the deep south, assuming those still exist. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=377.58s)]
*  Those people? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=379.97999999999996s)]
*  They're not dating my daughter, I can tell you that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  So in other words, we learned this week [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=384.28s)]
*  that Barack Obama really is a racist [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  and not in the way you've always assumed. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=387.4s)]
*  Obama may hate white people, he certainly seems to, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=389.21999999999997s)]
*  but he also demands to live around them and only them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=391.84s)]
*  But the Obamas, to be fair, are not alone in this. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=396.38s)]
*  His friends at the news networks in Washington, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=398.58s)]
*  New York, and Los Angeles feel exactly the same way [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=400.6s)]
*  because they're exactly the same sort of people. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=402.54s)]
*  CNN, for example, spent the day interviewing people [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=405.42s)]
*  connected in some way to Martha's Vineyard. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=407.58s)]
*  Turns out that precisely none of them were excited [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=409.7s)]
*  about the plane load of Venezuelans. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=412.06s)]
*  One of them, the state rep for the island, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=413.98s)]
*  even blamed this show for the sudden blessed surge [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=415.98s)]
*  in diversity, watch this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=419.64s)]
*  Ron DeSantis and Republicans might want to play [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=421.86s)]
*  political games with people's lives. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=424.72s)]
*  I believe that's incredibly inhumane to be using women [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  and children and families as a political pawn [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=430.18s)]
*  that you can then not talk about on Tucker Carlson [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=433.04s)]
*  and pretend to be tough on immigration. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  Wow, so see if you can follow the argument here. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=438.72s)]
*  When penniless illegal aliens show up in Brownsville, Texas, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=441.66s)]
*  one of the poorest cities in the United States, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=445.5s)]
*  they are noble strivers. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=447.66s)]
*  They're looking for a better life in this country [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=449.54s)]
*  and we applaud them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=452.06s)]
*  Good luck in Brownsville, newly arrived immigrants. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=453.22s)]
*  But when these very same people jump the moat [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  and get a free flight to Martha's Vineyard, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=459.5s)]
*  it's something else entirely. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=461.3s)]
*  It is, as the state rep just told you, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=462.54s)]
*  playing political games with people's lives [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=464.66s)]
*  because it's dangerous. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=467.74s)]
*  These immigrants could wander into a clam bake by accident [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=468.94000000000005s)]
*  or worse, much worse. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=472.22s)]
*  Earlier today, CNN anchor John Berman, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=475.12s)]
*  who's got fired by the way this morning, this morning, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=476.98s)]
*  John Berman interviewed noted filmmaker Ken Burns. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=479.56s)]
*  Burns is famous, but sad, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=483.54s)]
*  exactly the kind of middle-aged prestige hound [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=485.38000000000005s)]
*  who spends an awful lot of time looming around Martha's Vineyard [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=487.62s)]
*  looking for other famous people. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=490.02000000000004s)]
*  Burns has a new film out that blames the United States [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=491.70000000000005s)]
*  of all countries on earth for the Holocaust. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=494.06s)]
*  Now that the World War II generation has passed, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=496.82000000000005s)]
*  Ken Burns can do that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=499.18s)]
*  There's no chance angry veterans will show up at his house [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=500.26000000000005s)]
*  and beat him with their canes [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=502.58000000000004s)]
*  for besmirching the memory of their closest friends [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=504.18s)]
*  who died in their early 20s fighting the Nazis. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  So Ken Burns can say whatever he wants [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=509.54s)]
*  and many will believe him. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=511.1s)]
*  So this morning, Burns played the role [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=512.6s)]
*  of Holocaust expert on CNN. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=514.22s)]
*  And you know what Ken Burns has discovered? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  Ken Burns has discovered that Ron DeSantis [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=519.16s)]
*  sending illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=521.16s)]
*  is pretty much exactly what Hitler did, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=523.2s)]
*  pretty much exactly. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=524.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=526.2s)]
*  All of your documentaries are about history, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=527.5400000000001s)]
*  but all of them also make you think about where we are now. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=530.36s)]
*  And we woke up to the news this morning [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  that Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=536.96s)]
*  sent two plane loads of migrants to Martha's Vineyard [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=538.64s)]
*  off the coast of Massachusetts, including kids and whatnot. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  And I'm not saying this is not a one for one. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=545.4s)]
*  This is not a parallel here in any way, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=547.24s)]
*  but it does address some of the same themes. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=549.76s)]
*  This is coming straight out of the authoritarian playbook. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=552.52s)]
*  This is what's so disturbing about DeSantis [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=555.88s)]
*  is to use human beings, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  to weaponize human beings for a political purpose. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=560.44s)]
*  Ooh, you hear that ladies and gentlemen? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=564.84s)]
*  It's literally, literally just like the Holocaust. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=566.22s)]
*  Edgar Town is Dachau, Oak Bluffs is Treblinka, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=569.98s)]
*  the horrors, this is genocide. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=572.58s)]
*  And it may be, but of course everything is relative. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=575.34s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard may be a modern day death camp, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=577.96s)]
*  but compared to where illegal aliens usually go, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=580.02s)]
*  it doesn't look that bad. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=581.74s)]
*  Let's compare this for fun. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=583.58s)]
*  On your screen, you will see images recently shot [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=584.78s)]
*  in America's border towns, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=587.02s)]
*  which are now completely overrun [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=588.78s)]
*  under Joe Biden's immigration policy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  You will notice if you look carefully, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=591.9s)]
*  chaos, violence, and filth. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=593.46s)]
*  Okay, now we will take you to Martha's Vineyard. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=595.56s)]
*  It's hellish perhaps, but in a very different way. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=598.56s)]
*  Families eating together on balconies, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=602.0s)]
*  overlooking the water, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=603.64s)]
*  women doing their shopping [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=604.76s)]
*  in a quaint little town on bicycles, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  couples strolling along the boardwalk, sailboats. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=607.92s)]
*  Doesn't look that bad. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=611.56s)]
*  Ah, but that's exactly the problem, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=612.7399999999999s)]
*  the media told us today. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard may seem like one of the richest places [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=617.0s)]
*  on the planet, but somehow, somehow, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=619.3s)]
*  there aren't enough social services there. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=621.68s)]
*  It's bereft of social services, unlike Brownsville. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=624.36s)]
*  As CBS News put it, quote, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=628.64s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard is not an urban metropolitan area [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=629.88s)]
*  with a robust social services infrastructure. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=632.3000000000001s)]
*  There's no Justice Department immigration court [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=634.96s)]
*  where the migrants can attend asylum hearings. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=637.0s)]
*  There's no ice field office where migrants can check in. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=639.4s)]
*  Now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  But you see, Martha's Vineyard isn't, quote, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=645.0s)]
*  an urban area with a, quote, robust social services [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=647.12s)]
*  infrastructure that other people get to deal with. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=650.84s)]
*  And honestly, that's true. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=654.08s)]
*  And it's kind of the whole idea. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=655.72s)]
*  That's why DeSantis sent the illegal aliens [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=658.0600000000001s)]
*  to Martha's Vineyard. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=660.82s)]
*  People who make and advocate for certain policies [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=662.82s)]
*  should at some point have to live with those policies. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=665.84s)]
*  But until now, they haven't had to. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=670.2s)]
*  Bill Gates goes to Martha's Vineyard. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=672.1600000000001s)]
*  So does Oprah, James Taylor, Spike Lee, Amy Schumer, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  and many more. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=677.36s)]
*  And all of them, everyone is a much better person [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=678.24s)]
*  than you are because they support diversity. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  And now, for the first time, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=683.6s)]
*  they're gonna have some diversity. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=685.4s)]
*  But it's just the beginning. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=687.08s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard will need many, many more illegal aliens. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=688.5s)]
*  Tens of thousands more until the island [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=691.28s)]
*  is no longer majority white. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=693.02s)]
*  Only then can it be a good place. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=694.9200000000001s)]
*  Yet at the same time, the people who currently go [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=697.8000000000001s)]
*  to Martha's Vineyard are gonna have to keep going there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=699.72s)]
*  They can't run away to somewhere else. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=702.26s)]
*  That would be immoral. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=704.24s)]
*  It would be, as Michelle Obama has told us, white flight. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=705.7s)]
*  Now, massive demographic change will obviously make [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=710.14s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard a very different sort of place, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=712.12s)]
*  but that's okay. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=714.76s)]
*  Change is good. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=716.16s)]
*  Anyone who fears change is racist. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=717.52s)]
*  We know that for sure because they told us that for years. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=720.4s)]
*  So where, you may ask, will all these new people live [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=724.0s)]
*  on such a small island? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=727.62s)]
*  Simple. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=729.86s)]
*  First, they can occupy Barack Obama's compound. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=730.92s)]
*  There is no reason Obama needs that much space. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  Nobody needs that much space. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=735.92s)]
*  You could probably fit a dozen immigrant families [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  in Barack Obama's pool house [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=739.9s)]
*  and another five or six in the pantry. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=741.7s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=743.5s)]
*  Build a soccer field on the lawn, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=744.58s)]
*  an outdoor goat barbecue by the back door, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=746.0s)]
*  and bingo, you've got affordable housing. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=748.14s)]
*  But it won't be enough. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=751.0600000000001s)]
*  The Vineyard is going to need to construct shanty towns [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=752.78s)]
*  for all these new people, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=755.1s)]
*  but we can't call them shanty towns. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=755.94s)]
*  Obviously, that's demeaning. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=757.48s)]
*  So we're gonna call them townships [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=759.5s)]
*  after Obama's favorite country. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=761.0600000000001s)]
*  And then we're gonna give them dignified names [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=762.54s)]
*  that suggest some kind of victory over adversity. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=764.46s)]
*  Mandela, Cesar Chavezville, Kamala Apopoulos. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=767.06s)]
*  Now, each side, each one will put a plaque [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=772.18s)]
*  with that famous Emma Lazarus poem [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=774.26s)]
*  just so that everybody knows [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=776.26s)]
*  that these are not ordinary favelas. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=777.5s)]
*  These are moral victories. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=780.0999999999999s)]
*  As the signs say in Martha's Vineyard to this day, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=781.7399999999999s)]
*  no human is illegal, love is love. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=783.92s)]
*  That's just science. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=786.6199999999999s)]
*  But speaking of science, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=788.38s)]
*  what will the environmental impact [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=789.6999999999999s)]
*  of all this new development be? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=792.5999999999999s)]
*  That's a massive concern on Martha's Vineyard [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=793.7399999999999s)]
*  and for good reason. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=795.5799999999999s)]
*  But in this case, it's not a concern. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=797.9s)]
*  None of these new townships [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=799.0600000000001s)]
*  will have running water or electricity. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=800.48s)]
*  So by definition, they will be carbon neutral. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=802.66s)]
*  It'll be part of the Green Revolution. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=805.62s)]
*  Local law enforcement services won't be strained either [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=808.1s)]
*  because they won't be needed. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=810.26s)]
*  None of these new arrivals will be bound by local laws. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=812.0s)]
*  Why would they be? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=815.26s)]
*  They ignored federal law to get here. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=816.3000000000001s)]
*  There's no reason that they should have to observe [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=817.98s)]
*  the vineyard's ordinances against, say, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=819.9s)]
*  drunk driving or defecating in public. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=822.1800000000001s)]
*  And just in case there are still vineyarders [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=825.3s)]
*  who think they have the right to protect what they own, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=827.22s)]
*  think again, people. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  We refer you to the case of the fascist McCloskey family [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=830.9s)]
*  in St. Louis who once tried that, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=834.02s)]
*  tried to defend what's theirs and they got indicted for it. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=836.14s)]
*  So that's not allowed. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=838.5s)]
*  But we can't fully trust you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=840.3s)]
*  Somebody's gonna have to go door to door [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=841.3s)]
*  to make sure that not one person on Martha's Vineyard [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=843.02s)]
*  keeps a gun at home [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=845.54s)]
*  because self-defense can be tempting, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=847.14s)]
*  even for Democratic voters. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=849.06s)]
*  There's a lot of change for the vineyard [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=852.12s)]
*  and they're going to need to start work soon. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=853.42s)]
*  The summer season begins on Memorial Day. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=854.86s)]
*  So when Amy Schumer shows up to her place in June, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=857.8199999999999s)]
*  she better be ready to find an illegal alien family [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=860.6999999999999s)]
*  using her bath towels. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=863.06s)]
*  Yes, she will, and let's hope she doesn't complain about it [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=864.78s)]
*  because as Joe Biden often reminds us, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=867.5799999999999s)]
*  illegal immigration is a gift. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=870.3399999999999s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=873.5799999999999s)]
*  They're the reason why. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  The legal as well as undocumented [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=876.3399999999999s)]
*  are the reason why our society is functioning, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=878.78s)]
*  the reason why our economy is growing. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=881.3399999999999s)]
*  We don't talk about that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=884.02s)]
*  We stand up and act like it's a burden. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=884.86s)]
*  It is not a burden. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=886.86s)]
*  It's a gift. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=888.46s)]
*  Hear that? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=891.14s)]
*  Hear that? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=892.0600000000001s)]
*  Illegal immigration is not a burden. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=893.3000000000001s)]
*  It's a gift, dumbo. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=895.34s)]
*  So Martha's Vineyard received an enormous gift last night. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=897.98s)]
*  Think of it like a perpetual Christmas, but noisier. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=901.38s)]
*  And you can't beat the timing as Kareen Jean-Pierre [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=905.34s)]
*  just reminded us today at the White House, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=907.78s)]
*  it's Hispanic Heritage Month. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=909.5s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=911.02s)]
*  So roll with it, Martha's Vineyard. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=911.98s)]
*  Things are about to change a lot for you, but that's okay. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=914.9s)]
*  Radical destructive change is the essence of anti-racism. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=919.38s)]
*  And as you've told us so many times, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=923.64s)]
*  you support anti-racism. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=925.4200000000001s)]
*  Less we need to remind you. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=928.88s)]
*  And in any case, pretty soon you'll have no memory [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=930.1s)]
*  of the way things were before. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=932.5s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard will feel and look just like El Paso [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=934.7s)]
*  and that will all seem normal to you. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=937.34s)]
*  What's El Paso like, you wonder? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  Haven't been there lately? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=942.3s)]
*  Okay, well here's some recent pictures. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=943.14s)]
*  I wanna show you an exact look [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=945.9399999999999s)]
*  of what we're seeing out here. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=947.54s)]
*  We're right next to the Greyhound bus station [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=949.9s)]
*  where as we've been telling you for days now, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=951.62s)]
*  migrants, mostly a large group of Venezuelans [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=953.78s)]
*  have been using this area as a temporary camp and a home. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=956.5s)]
*  Now take a look at this video [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=959.78s)]
*  from earlier this morning and overnight, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=960.92s)]
*  where you can see migrants have set up sleeping arrangements [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=962.78s)]
*  on cardboard and mattresses in this same spot [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=964.98s)]
*  here outside the bus station. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=967.54s)]
*  DiAgostito, another city leader, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=968.9399999999999s)]
*  said their number one priority [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=970.42s)]
*  is to avoid people on the streets. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=971.54s)]
*  But since CBP has been so overwhelmed [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=973.5s)]
*  with the large numbers coming in, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=975.5s)]
*  they have been forced to release as such. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=976.98s)]
*  As more and more people have been on the streets [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=978.98s)]
*  in recent days, sanitation and cleanliness [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=980.9s)]
*  have become a concern out here. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=982.9s)]
*  We're not seeing any porta potties or temporary toilets, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=984.42s)]
*  showers or sinks. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=986.54s)]
*  And as you can imagine, the smell is beginning to add up. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=987.54s)]
*  Oh wow, look, El Paso is Venezuelans too. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=991.42s)]
*  And that's why tonight it's redolent of diversity, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=995.56s)]
*  brimming with the gift of illegal immigration. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=998.26s)]
*  That'll be Edgar town, Massachusetts soon, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1001.14s)]
*  but we can't stop there, why would we? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1003.7s)]
*  If we're really going to make Martha's Vineyard [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1005.46s)]
*  look like the world, the people who vacation [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1007.5s)]
*  on Martha's Vineyard have created for the rest of us, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1009.74s)]
*  we're gonna need to import graffiti artists, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1012.78s)]
*  armed robbers and subway rapists [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1014.96s)]
*  in the drug addicted homeless community. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1016.94s)]
*  Many, many of those, and their tents. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1018.86s)]
*  Why should they be living outside your house [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1021.62s)]
*  when they can be camped on Barack Obama's $12 million lawn? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1023.64s)]
*  That seems fair, why isn't it fair? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1027.32s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, we don't expect Obama [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1029.84s)]
*  to see it the same way. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1031.36s)]
*  He is a racist as we've established, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1032.24s)]
*  and so apparently are his fellow liberals. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1034.52s)]
*  They are outraged by the idea of illegal aliens [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1036.3999999999999s)]
*  near their island vacation homes. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1038.96s)]
*  But for long, they'll be tweeting in solidarity [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1041.04s)]
*  with the vineyards white community. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1042.9399999999998s)]
*  Hashtag, I stand with Martha's Vineyard. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1044.36s)]
*  Little island emojis in their bios, hilarious. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1046.76s)]
*  That could actually happen by the way, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1049.76s)]
*  because in the end, liberals really do stand [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1051.4399999999998s)]
*  with Martha's Vineyard against everyone else. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1054.24s)]
*  And honestly, on some level, we can kind of understand why. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1057.4399999999998s)]
*  If we're being honest, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  we don't wanna see Martha's Vineyard trashed. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1061.4399999999998s)]
*  We're Americans, and Martha's Vineyard is a beautiful place. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1064.34s)]
*  It's a sin to destroy beautiful things, always. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1067.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, and this really is the point, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1071.24s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard is one of a dwindling number [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1073.6799999999998s)]
*  of beautiful places left in our country. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1076.1399999999999s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard is what most of America once was, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1078.72s)]
*  not all that long ago. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1081.3999999999999s)]
*  Small, socially cohesive, orderly, safe, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1082.8s)]
*  with traditional human-centered architecture [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1087.0s)]
*  and big stretches of nature, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1089.96s)]
*  unspoiled by industrial wind farms and dollar stores. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1091.76s)]
*  The people who live in Martha's Vineyard [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1096.4s)]
*  now didn't build any of that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1097.72s)]
*  The people who did build it are long gone, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1099.48s)]
*  along with the attitudes and values that made it possible. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1101.88s)]
*  The people who live there now just came for the nostalgia, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1105.64s)]
*  and all that's left really are the buildings and the beaches, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1107.84s)]
*  but still you'd hate to see them wrecked. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1110.72s)]
*  On the other hand, at this point, we may have no choice. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1113.24s)]
*  No sane country would allow millions of foreign nationals [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1115.92s)]
*  to walk across its borders illegally [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1119.8000000000002s)]
*  and then immediately give them government benefits [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1122.2s)]
*  in exchange for mocking a rule of law. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1124.52s)]
*  No one would ever do that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1127.2s)]
*  It is suicide. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  Over time, it will destroy the United States. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1130.76s)]
*  Everyone can see that, no matter what they say. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1133.5600000000002s)]
*  But the people who vacate on Martha's Vineyard don't care. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1136.88s)]
*  They are making this possible. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1139.68s)]
*  They support it, they vote for it, they fund it, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  and they can do all of that because they are so insulated [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1144.7s)]
*  from the effects of Joe Biden's lunatic immigration policies [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1147.38s)]
*  that none of it matters to them. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1150.74s)]
*  The country collapses. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1153.02s)]
*  Big deal, they live on an island. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1154.0600000000002s)]
*  But to the rest of us, it is a big deal. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1157.0600000000002s)]
*  This is our country. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1159.38s)]
*  We were born here. We plan to die here. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1160.98s)]
*  We have nowhere else to go, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1162.9s)]
*  and we don't want to live in a slum. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1164.14s)]
*  Maybe Martha's Vineyard will finally understand. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1167.66s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1170.42s)]
*  to catch our nightly opens, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2eCll6L8s&t=1172.7s)]
