# How we know Biden has contempt for America: GOP gubernatorial candidate
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E)
*  So there's a very narrow range of things [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=0.0s)]
*  that you're allowed to pay attention to [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  or care about or be mad about, as you know. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=4.28s)]
*  Couple of weeks ago, months ago, it was Corona, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=7.72s)]
*  before that it was white supremacy, now it's Ukraine. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  But as you're totally absorbed in whatever [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=12.68s)]
*  that one big story is, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=14.6s)]
*  all kinds of other things are going on. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=15.68s)]
*  And here's one of them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  The Biden administration is flying [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  huge numbers of illegal aliens [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=19.72s)]
*  who snuck into our country, mostly through Texas, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=21.64s)]
*  up to the Northeast, in this case to Westchester, New York. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=23.96s)]
*  Now they haven't announced that they're doing this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  because I guess in a democracy, you can do whatever you want [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=28.52s)]
*  and it doesn't matter what people think. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=30.84s)]
*  We only know about it because a former [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=32.24s)]
*  Westchester County executive called Rob Astorino noticed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=33.8s)]
*  He obtained the footage you're now seeing on your screen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=37.44s)]
*  So buses at your expense are transporting [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=39.84s)]
*  illegal foreign nationals right as they land, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=42.36s)]
*  but it's not clear where they're going. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=45.56s)]
*  The Biden administration won't tell us [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  because again, it's not our country, it's theirs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Rob Astorino is now using the democratic process [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  to restore power to people. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=54.64s)]
*  He's running for governor of the state of New York. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=56.16s)]
*  We're happy to have him join us tonight. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=57.68s)]
*  Rob Astorino, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  So this is continuing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=61.4s)]
*  Have you been able to get any answers [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=64.16s)]
*  from the administration over what they're doing? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=66.2s)]
*  None whatsoever. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=69.72s)]
*  I asked on August 13th, when I blew the lid on this, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=70.72s)]
*  had a press conference, wanted to know who was coming in, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  were they vaccinated? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=77.2s)]
*  We had public health issues, public safety issues, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=78.4s)]
*  public's right to know, and dead silence, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=80.88s)]
*  other than calling me and everybody who questioned them [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=83.12s)]
*  a racist and a hater. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=85.32s)]
*  And then the New York Post did a great job blowing it up, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  and then the flights stopped for a while. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Still no answers though. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  Now the flights have resumed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  One came in Sunday night, you have the video [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=94.08s)]
*  of them deplaning and the buses. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=96.56s)]
*  And one just came in one hour ago, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=100.08s)]
*  Tuckahoe to Westchester County Airport, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  and they're deplaning right now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  So this is gonna continue. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  And the Biden administration must have such contempt [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=109.32s)]
*  for Americans that they're importing people [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=112.36s)]
*  from other countries, flying them into the interior [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=114.72s)]
*  and disbursing them, and then turning them into voters [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=118.32s)]
*  like New York City, where they will be allowed to vote [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  with 30 day residency. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  And Governor Kathy Hochul, she has set up [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=124.64s)]
*  a $2 billion fund in New York, so that's a magnet [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=127.68s)]
*  for free stuff for anyone to come here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=131.92s)]
*  So they get a phone, then they get the El Paso Express [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=133.96s)]
*  to Westchester and everywhere else, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  and then they get almost all the other goodies, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=139.56s)]
*  and the entire time, we, the citizens, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=142.12s)]
*  won't even get an answer from our government, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  and we get stuck with the tab. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  You're an elected governor, by the way. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  Kathy Hochul's never been elected governor [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=150.52s)]
*  of the state of New York, speaking of democracy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  So do citizens of New York who pay some [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=154.36s)]
*  of the highest tax rates in the country, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=156.8s)]
*  they get free phones and free flights, free transportation? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=158.24s)]
*  No? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=162.52s)]
*  No, you know what we get to do? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  We still get to wear masks on our flights. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=164.4s)]
*  We still get to have to mask our toddlers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=166.44s)]
*  We still get fingers pointed at us for being bad people [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  and not saying it's a good thing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  that people are coming across our border. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=175.2s)]
*  What's gonna happen, by the way, Title 42, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  which is gonna be rescinded, that's the last tool [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  in the toolbox for Customs and Border Patrol agents [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=182.28s)]
*  to send people back to expel them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=185.28s)]
*  Once they no longer have that, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  by the own administration's admission, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=189.6s)]
*  they're gonna be flooded even more, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=192.32s)]
*  so you're gonna have more flights and more bus loads [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=194.28s)]
*  coming into our schools, our communities, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=197.0s)]
*  and they'll never tell us who it is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=200.04s)]
*  It's all beyond belief. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=202.12s)]
*  I hope you're rewarded for your honesty. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=203.96s)]
*  Rob Astorino, running for Governor of New York, thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bruC6AZYO4E&t=205.72s)]
