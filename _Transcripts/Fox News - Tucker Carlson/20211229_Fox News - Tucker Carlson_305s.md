# This will be an injustice: Nancy Grace
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM)
*  All right, during Ghislaine Maxwell's trial, we got an inside look into Jeffrey Epstein's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=0.0s)]
*  Manhattan mansion. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=4.04s)]
*  Photographs taken by federal investigators, which you can now see on your screen, show [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=6.0s)]
*  Epstein had several boxes of hard drives that were oddly covered in evidence tape. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=10.38s)]
*  Investigators also took photos of numerous black binders and CDs, which contained additional [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=16.04s)]
*  evidence and in some cases, allegedly child pornography. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=22.28s)]
*  The federal judge in the case ruled some of the labels on these binders were, quote, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=25.72s)]
*  identifying information for third parties. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=29.68s)]
*  So they were redacted. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=32.66s)]
*  Investigators also found this completely bizarre painting on your screen now of Bill Clinton [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  in a blue dress. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=39.36s)]
*  So who should be most worried tonight? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=41.08s)]
*  Is it Bill Clinton? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=45.42s)]
*  Is it Prince Andrew? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=46.78s)]
*  Nancy Grace is the host of Crime Stories on Fox Nation, and she joins us now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=48.2s)]
*  Nancy, thank you for jumping on with us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=52.68s)]
*  Who do you think sleeps uneasily tonight? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=55.12s)]
*  Well, that's obvious to me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=58.12s)]
*  The person that's sleeping the least tonight is Ghislaine Maxwell, because she's headed [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  to a federal pen, which one? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=65.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=67.2s)]
*  Her sentencing is coming up and it's not been scheduled, but she's looking at 65 years behind [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=68.34s)]
*  bars. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  So let me just take one moment and bask in the moment of justice finally handed down, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  long delayed. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=81.4s)]
*  Now, will Ghislaine Maxwell sing for her supper? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  Will she name names? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  Possibly. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=88.84s)]
*  But remember, even with her naming names, that case has to be proven with victims that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=89.84s)]
*  will come forward. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  And if you want to name a president, an ex-president, a wealthy individual, if you want to name [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  Leon Black or whoever, that's got to be corroborated in court. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=102.48s)]
*  Now that will be the trick. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=107.4s)]
*  Will Ghislaine Maxwell rat people out? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  Very likely. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=111.4s)]
*  Although she was pretty stoic in the courtroom today. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=112.4s)]
*  One of her lawyers broke down in tears in front of God and everybody. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  But Maxwell stayed cool. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=118.72s)]
*  One last look back at her family and she walked out of the courtroom. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=120.76s)]
*  I don't know if she's going to crack. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=125.26s)]
*  So on her screen right now is a picture of Chelsea Clinton's wedding. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=128.0s)]
*  You can see Bill Clinton walking her down the aisle. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=131.24s)]
*  Highlighted in the background there is Ghislaine Maxwell at that wedding. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  There is also pictures on your screen of Bill Clinton at various times flashing up, receiving [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=137.6s)]
*  a massage. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=142.44s)]
*  You know, it's true, as you said, Nancy, it's justice tonight that Ghislaine Maxwell sleeps [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=143.44s)]
*  uneasily behind bars. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=148.44s)]
*  But I think everybody watching is concerned that justice stops here, which would be an [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=150.32s)]
*  injustice because clearly she was trafficking these young women to other people, to individuals, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  and you would have to suspect beyond Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=162.06s)]
*  The prosecution has shown very little interest. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=164.16s)]
*  In fact, they've discouraged any names coming out in this trial, quote unquote, third parties. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=166.48s)]
*  And so I have to wonder with everything found in his apartment, CDs, binders, Nancy, will [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  we get those names beyond whether or not they will be corroborated? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=177.48s)]
*  Will somebody ask Nancy, will we pursue that next step in justice? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=180.42s)]
*  I believe with all the heat on federal prosecutors right now that they will go forward, that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  they will explore the possibilities within all of those binders. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=193.4s)]
*  It's hard to keep a secret like that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=197.84s)]
*  There were detectives, there were investigators, there were crime scene techs everywhere. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=200.84s)]
*  They saw all of that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=205.12s)]
*  I find it very difficult to believe that they would keep it all under their hat for what, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=207.0s)]
*  propriety. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=212.52s)]
*  That's not going to happen if in fact the evidence to which you are referring exists. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=213.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=217.8s)]
*  And speaking of that evidence, Nancy, what do you make of what was cataloged inside of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=218.8s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein's apartment? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=222.76s)]
*  Well, if it had anything to do with these particular victims, the four women that came [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=223.76s)]
*  forward very, very bravely, it would have been brought out at trial. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=230.0s)]
*  If it's got to do with other alleged victims, they've got to be hunted down, tracked down, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  coerced to testify, let me say encouraged to move forward with a lot stacked against [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=240.88s)]
*  them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=247.88s)]
*  And that's going to be a very daunting task. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=248.88s)]
*  But I believe with so many people at the crime scene, it's very possible names will be named. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=250.92s)]
*  It will be an injustice if this is the end of the story and not the beginning. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=257.52s)]
*  Yes, it will. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=261.76s)]
*  If there are other perpetrators, no matter how prestigious they may be, no matter how [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=262.88s)]
*  wealthy they may be, if they are not sought out and prosecuted, that is an injustice. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=268.12s)]
*  Lady Justice wears a blindfold for a reason. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=275.84s)]
*  She is not to care about your wealth or your education or your status. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=279.4s)]
*  That's why she is depicted the way she is. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=284.32s)]
*  And it is an injustice if that investigation is not completed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  Nancy Grace, thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpTrceVvahM&t=290.76s)]
