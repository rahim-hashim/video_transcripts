# Cyber expert tells Tucker this is the 'great danger' in Twitter's shadow banning
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg)
*  Sobhumari is the founder and editor of Compact. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=0.0s)]
*  He says that the problem is deeper. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=3.68s)]
*  No corporation should have this much power [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  over our freedom to speak. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=8.44s)]
*  Sob, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=9.88s)]
*  So that and that was my summary of your view. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=11.68s)]
*  Tell us, what do you conclude from this? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=15.4s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Tucker. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=19.36s)]
*  The great danger in what we've now seen, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=20.56s)]
*  we all suspected it, of course, all along, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  but now we have confirmation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=26.48s)]
*  that shadow banning was happening. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=27.84s)]
*  The great danger in this isn't that our freedom of speech [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=29.88s)]
*  is suppressed, although that's horrible. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=32.76s)]
*  And of course, these platforms are where freedom of speech [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=35.04s)]
*  lives or dives, but that the process [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=37.56s)]
*  that allows elite opinion formation [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=41.08s)]
*  is a sealed off bubble, right? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=43.84s)]
*  That we hear, for example, that Vladimir Putin [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=46.44s)]
*  doesn't hear alternative views [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=49.44s)]
*  about his war strategy in Ukraine, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=51.24s)]
*  and that's why he makes bad decisions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=53.4s)]
*  Well, the same thing happens through a less direct [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=55.6s)]
*  state-directed mechanism in the United States [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=58.6s)]
*  and across the West. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=61.2s)]
*  It happens through privatized censorship, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=62.36s)]
*  through entities like Twitter, but importantly, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=64.92s)]
*  not just Twitter, Facebook, et cetera. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=67.36s)]
*  If our elites aren't willing to listen to dissident voices [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=69.72s)]
*  of eminent doctors like Dr. Jay Bhattachaya, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=74.2s)]
*  as we now know for sure, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  then they don't make good decisions, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=79.48s)]
*  Because they're convincing themselves, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  they're sealing themselves in a bubble, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=84.16s)]
*  not ultimately that different [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=85.72s)]
*  from the kind of bubble that a Qaddafi or a Putin create [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=88.0s)]
*  in a different way in their own sort of councils [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=92.32s)]
*  of decision-making. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=94.96s)]
*  So that's the kind of scary part of this, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=96.16s)]
*  is that our elite are themselves structurally [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=98.28s)]
*  turning themselves into bubble boys. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  And into what they say they hate. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=105.08s)]
*  I mean, I honestly wondered, I don't know the answer, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  but could Russian media be more controlled [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=109.44s)]
*  than American media is? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=112.83999999999999s)]
*  I mean, maybe, but maybe not. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, in 2020, obviously, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  I was working at the New York Post, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  that confluence of corporate, big tech, deep state, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  blue check media all working together, you saw that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=128.23999999999998s)]
*  In a way, it was sort of more terrifying [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=131.76s)]
*  because there's no center of power. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=134.72s)]
*  You can say, hey, it's this one person [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=137.04s)]
*  we can appeal through this recognized process, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=139.32s)]
*  which is why, Tucker, I think we need to still insist [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=141.56s)]
*  on Section 230 reform. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=145.24s)]
*  I won't get into the details, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=146.84s)]
*  but basically the reason Twitter and Facebook and YouTube [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=148.32s)]
*  and all these others get to get away with this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=151.68s)]
*  is that because of a law in the 1990s [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=153.8s)]
*  that was designed to help them censor things [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=156.32s)]
*  like pornography, it's called [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=159.28s)]
*  the Communications Decency Act, they're using that, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=160.56s)]
*  they're abusing that now to act like publishers, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=163.68s)]
*  but without bearing any of the traditional [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=166.96s)]
*  publishers liabilities. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=169.12s)]
*  And so that has to be changed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=171.24s)]
*  because if you and I libel someone, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=173.0s)]
*  in print or in the media, we face this kind of liability. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=175.44s)]
*  And of course, they do not, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=179.04s)]
*  and that's why they get to censor. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=180.96s)]
*  They get to act like worldview publishers, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=182.52s)]
*  but without bearing any of a traditional [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=185.64s)]
*  publishers liabilities. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  That needs to change because, okay, I'm really grateful, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=190.92s)]
*  truly God bless Elon Musk, but it's not just one company, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=194.28s)]
*  it's these others as well. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=198.12s)]
*  They're all sort of monopolistic giants [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=199.44s)]
*  and we have no pushback mechanism against them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=201.2s)]
*  This has to have a structural public policy response. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=203.76s)]
*  So, Bermari, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=208.44s)]
*  Thanks, Chuck. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bsl71ybcg&t=211.0s)]
