# Sen. Hawley: Men are in crisis
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8)
*  So for all the women's empowerment talk that continues at pace like it's 1973, the numbers are really clear. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=0.0s)]
*  It's men in this country who are in deep trouble by every measure. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=5.2s)]
*  A couple years ago we did a series called Men in America, which explained exactly how men are falling behind in this country. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=8.3s)]
*  We found that important at the time. It's even more important now. The numbers are even worse. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=15.8s)]
*  Finally, a member of Congress noticed this and spoke to it forcefully. That was Senator Josh Hawley. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=21.2s)]
*  He spoke at the National Conservatism Conference and he pointed out something obvious, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=25.5s)]
*  that masculinity is under attack in this country and men are withering and dying as a result of it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=29.0s)]
*  That's not an overstatement. Anybody familiar with the social science can confirm that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=34.5s)]
*  So over at MSNBC, of course, they found this deeply offensive. They compared Josh Hawley, of course, to Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=39.0s)]
*  Josh Hawley, with his trademark laser-like precision, has honed in on the real front burner issue in America, masculinity in this country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=47.6s)]
*  I am certainly not shocked that he said something this wacky because he said stuff like this before. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=56.6s)]
*  It's a couple of dashes of political extremism from a very, very cynical, Stanford-educated United States Senator. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=61.4s)]
*  It's a dollop of the type of rhetoric that you may hear in Vladimir Putin's Russia, that you may hear in Viktor Orban's Hungary. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=70.4s)]
*  It's a fusion of these masculine notions, right? This is why you see Putin posing with tigers with his shirt off. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=80.1s)]
*  At some point, we're going to take a closer, forensic look at the personal lives of the three people you just saw on the screen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  A lot of happy, well-balanced relationships, do you think? Probably not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=94.8s)]
*  Josh Hawley, by contrast, is the Senator from Missouri about whom they were complaining. He joins us tonight. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=99.3s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for coming on. So you felt moved to defend masculinity. How come? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, because it's in crisis. Men are in crisis, Tucker, as you pointed out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Listen, we've got at least 16 million men in this country who are out of the labor force. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  They're not just unemployed. They're not even trying to work. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=117.5s)]
*  And I'm talking about able-bodied men, prime-age men. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=120.1s)]
*  We have an epidemic of fatherlessness in this country. What's the left saying? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=123.3s)]
*  The left saying that America is a systemically oppressive place and that men are to blame and that masculinity is to blame. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=126.8s)]
*  You know, if you want to be a man, if you are assertive, if you're independent, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=133.2s)]
*  if you display those characteristics that psychologists have associated with men for decades, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=136.9s)]
*  then you're contributing to the oppressive place that is America. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=141.6s)]
*  That just isn't true. And it's time that we call that out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=145.4s)]
*  And it's time that we say to young men in particular, we need you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=148.3s)]
*  We need you to be responsible. We need you to get a job. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=151.9s)]
*  And you can make this country a better place by being who you were meant to be. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=154.3s)]
*  And we should call men to that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=158.8s)]
*  God, that's, I mean, I can't imagine why anyone would be anything but grateful to hear that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=160.6s)]
*  Why do you think that triggers the morons so much? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=166.2s)]
*  Well, because the left, they hate this country, but they also, they don't believe in gender. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=170.1s)]
*  You know, I mean, they're trying to do away with gender and they don't believe in manhood or womanhood. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, these are the same people who are trying to do away with women's sports. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  Let's not forget Tucker. So this is a war on gender all the way around. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  And I think the idea of having independent men and independent women for that matter, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=184.7s)]
*  but independent men who would actually go to work and be responsible and contribute to their families and contribute to society. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=189.1s)]
*  The left finds that scary because those are not the kind of people who will just be told to fall in line by the government [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=195.2s)]
*  and do whatever the government says to do. And the left doesn't want that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  They don't believe in manhood at all. They think it's inherently oppressive. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=204.1s)]
*  We've got to call them out on these falsehoods, and they are false. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=207.6s)]
*  And we've got to call men to responsibility. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  For all of our sakes, men and women need each other. If one group fails, everyone suffers. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=214.6s)]
*  I mean, that's real. That's how we're made, unfortunately, maybe, but it's true. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=218.89999999999998s)]
*  Senator Hawley, I appreciate your coming on tonight and for the truth that you're telling about that. Thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=222.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqkWJZTYnr8&t=228.4s)]
