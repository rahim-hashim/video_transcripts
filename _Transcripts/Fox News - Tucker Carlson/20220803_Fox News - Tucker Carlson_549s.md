# Bryson DeChambeau reveals why he joined LIV Golf
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q)
*  So last week our producers suggested a story on golf. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I said, I hunt and fish, I don't know anything about golf. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  And they said, no, it's actually really interesting. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=5.36s)]
*  And it is interesting. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=6.72s)]
*  There's a new league called Live Golf [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  competing with the PGA Tour. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=10.8s)]
*  So we decided to go down to Trump Bedminster, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=13.6s)]
*  Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=16.84s)]
*  this weekend to learn more about it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=18.96s)]
*  Now we showed you part of our visit last night. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=20.04s)]
*  We had a conversation with the new commissioner [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=22.68s)]
*  of Live Golf, Greg Norman, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=24.52s)]
*  one of the greatest players in the world. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=26.16s)]
*  But we wanted to know what the players [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  who are participating in Live Golf think of this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=28.56s)]
*  And why'd they leave the PGA anyway? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=30.28s)]
*  Why would anyone leave the PGA? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=31.6s)]
*  Well, Bryson DeChambeau is one of the best golfers [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=33.2s)]
*  in the world, played at SMU. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=35.04s)]
*  He's one of the longest drivers in the history of the sport. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=36.76s)]
*  He's now playing for Live. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=39.16s)]
*  He's got a really interesting personal story too. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=41.36s)]
*  So we sat down with him and asked him [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=43.16s)]
*  lots of golf related questions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=44.6s)]
*  Here's part of what he said. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  You spent six years on the PGA Tour. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  You were one of the best young players in college. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  How'd you wind up here? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=57.52s)]
*  It was a controversial choice according to a lot of people. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Definitely, a lot of opportunity. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=61.64s)]
*  That was the first and foremost thing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=64.2s)]
*  There was a new opportunity to do something different [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=66.28s)]
*  in the game of golf. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  I've always been a bit of a trendsetter. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=68.8s)]
*  When I was growing up, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=71.0s)]
*  I always thought that I'd do something cool [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=71.84s)]
*  in the game of golf. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  I didn't know what it would be. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=74.64s)]
*  Now that I see this, I know this is a big part of it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=76.16s)]
*  And the reason I say that is because [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=79.04s)]
*  I've always thought that golf has to start to tailor [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=80.68s)]
*  to the younger generation [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=83.92s)]
*  if we want to continue to grow the game. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=85.4s)]
*  I'm all about growth in the game of golf. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=87.12s)]
*  And I think that as time has gone on, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=89.2s)]
*  this opportunity with live golf, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=91.6s)]
*  the way it's structured from an investment perspective, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=94.16s)]
*  also from a enjoyment perspective, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  an entertainment perspective, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=100.4s)]
*  all has a possibility to do things [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=101.8s)]
*  that the game of golf has never seen before. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=103.28s)]
*  When you talk to people about live, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=106.08s)]
*  they suggest that there's been a violation [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=108.56s)]
*  of some kind of unspoken honor code in golf, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=110.6s)]
*  or you're going to change the culture of golf [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=113.36s)]
*  and make it more vulgar, more populist, less honorable. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=115.8s)]
*  I know you hear versions of that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=121.72s)]
*  I'm not sure I'm describing it exactly right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=123.2s)]
*  But the spirit of golf is being somehow despoiled [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=124.96s)]
*  or desecrated by this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=131.48s)]
*  Well, the spirit of golf, look, I think [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=133.68s)]
*  that in every industry, no matter what it is, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=137.04s)]
*  it's always been changing, innovating, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=140.56s)]
*  And golf, I don't think is anything different. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=144.56s)]
*  Over the course of time, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=146.72s)]
*  if we want to continue to grow the game [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  or make the game more interesting, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  if you're going to keep it with hickory shafts [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=152.0s)]
*  and a ballotta ball and no technology, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  people are not going to be interested by that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=158.72s)]
*  We've got to find ways to make it more interesting, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=160.52s)]
*  whether it's a new format, teams. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  That's personally one of my favorite things about live golf [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  is the team aspect. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  No, I think it's enhancing the spirit of the game. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=171.56s)]
*  So PGA Tour is saying that anyone who participates in live [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=173.68s)]
*  will be banned for life from PGA Tour. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=176.24s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't make sense. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=178.44s)]
*  You're 28, are you worried about that? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=179.28s)]
*  No, no, I think it'll get figured out. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=181.12s)]
*  And then I personally know that it will get figured out, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=183.0s)]
*  whether it's legally or whether they come to the table [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=185.12s)]
*  and work out terms. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=187.44s)]
*  I definitely think it'll all wash itself out in the future [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  pretty shortly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  But it's funny, it's so weird because it's like, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=194.28s)]
*  let's use this as a reference. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=197.8s)]
*  I heard this earlier this week, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  you have a pizza shop that's been in existence for 50 years [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  and all the customers go to it, it's a great product. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  All of a sudden, new pizza shop opens up, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=205.84s)]
*  and they start paying the customers [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  to come eat at their place. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  And that pizza's potentially a little bit better [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=212.12s)]
*  of a pizza, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=214.76s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, that original pizza house goes, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  if you go over there, we're banning you from ever coming [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=218.76s)]
*  back to our pizza shop. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=221.64s)]
*  What's wrong with that economic model? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  That does seem short-sighted. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=226.56s)]
*  Particularly if you have been the only pizza shop in town, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=228.8s)]
*  if you've had a monopoly, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  that's probably not allowed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=234.72s)]
*  But there is this vibe in golf, it's more than a vibe, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=236.28s)]
*  it's this kind of stated ethic where it's not really [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  about the money or you should play for free or... [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=244.28s)]
*  Well, in that case, it just becomes a hobby. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=247.36s)]
*  We're playing for free, I mean, those are our livelihoods [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=250.08s)]
*  and there's a great economic opportunity for golfers [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=251.56s)]
*  to make a lot of money. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's why we grew up playing golf, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  also for the history to go win majors [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  and win PGA Tour events initially. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=259.20000000000005s)]
*  And now I'm out here, I want to win live events. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=261.04s)]
*  I mean, you can see the passion and competitive aspect [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  of this environment out here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=265.92s)]
*  And we all want to compete to win every single week. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  Anytime anyone invests over a billion dollars [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=269.48s)]
*  into, let's say, the game of golf, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  how is that not going to grow the game? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=276.36s)]
*  How is that not going to provide more opportunities? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=277.72s)]
*  What did your parents, your friends, your caddy, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=279.56s)]
*  what did they all say? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=283.44s)]
*  Well, when we looked at the economics, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=284.44s)]
*  if it was solely for the economics, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=285.76s)]
*  it was a no-brainer. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=288.24s)]
*  Considering the relationships I've built with my sponsors, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  considering the relationship I have with the Tour, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=291.24s)]
*  relationship I have with my competitors [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=295.56s)]
*  out there on Tour as well, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=298.24s)]
*  I had to think about all of that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=299.64s)]
*  and how that affected my livelihood [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=301.56s)]
*  moving forward in the future. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=302.88s)]
*  And I had to wait, does the pros outweigh the cons? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=304.64s)]
*  And for me, from a financial perspective, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=307.8s)]
*  resource allocation perspective, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=310.2s)]
*  meaning like I'm able to do things now in Dallas, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  and I think we can get to that in a little bit. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=315.12s)]
*  But I had to wait all of those consequences, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=318.0s)]
*  social consequence, how I was going to be viewed publicly. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=320.32s)]
*  I've got a YouTube channel now that's growing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=323.88s)]
*  and doing very well, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=325.84s)]
*  and want to continue to produce product there [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=326.68s)]
*  so I can showcase entertainment and my skill set [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=328.76s)]
*  on that platform as well. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=331.36s)]
*  You are well known for bringing science to golf. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=332.76s)]
*  Give us an example. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=336.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=339.28s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of examples. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=340.12s)]
*  One of them that I can think of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  directly off the top of my head, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=342.32s)]
*  this is more statistics, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  but hitting it farther has been a big notion of mine. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=346.32s)]
*  And the reason I did that was because I knew [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  that if I could gain three more yards off the tee, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=352.8s)]
*  I could be six more yards offline, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=357.12s)]
*  so three more yards right or left, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=359.44s)]
*  and still have a positive strokes gain potential. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  And what that means is that I'm gaining shots on the field. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=366.44s)]
*  And so from that perspective, I took it on to me, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  how do I hit it farther? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=371.08s)]
*  How do I consistently hit it farther? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  How do I get my body stronger? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=373.44s)]
*  What do I do from a biomechanics perspective [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=375.76s)]
*  to make my golf swing more repeatable? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=377.0s)]
*  So I'll go on gears and try and understand [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  how my biomechanics are moving [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=380.44s)]
*  in order to be the most repeatable [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  and powerful athlete I can possibly be. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=383.88s)]
*  So how do you do that? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=386.16s)]
*  A lot of studying data, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=388.36s)]
*  trying to understand and crunching numbers, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  trying to understand how to create flat spots [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=391.48s)]
*  in the golf swing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=394.68s)]
*  This is getting really technical now. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=395.68s)]
*  Please do. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=397.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=398.0s)]
*  Trying to create flat spots in the golf swing [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=399.48s)]
*  where you're making a combined motion [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=401.32s)]
*  in a very consistent, straight manner. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=405.44s)]
*  It's not this arching manner [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=408.24s)]
*  that you're very sensitive to air on. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=409.56s)]
*  You're just trying to become less sensitive to air. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  So when I'm able to wrap around the corner, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=412.88s)]
*  this club is going down, but because I'm going up, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  it's actually planing out and it goes straight [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  into the ball. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=420.36s)]
*  So your angle of attack's more consistent. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  Your lofted impact, your dynamic loft, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  it impacts more consistent. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  So you're hitting your spots a lot more consistently, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=425.88s)]
*  meaning that your launch angle's gonna be consistent, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=428.56s)]
*  your spin rate's gonna be consistent, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=430.36s)]
*  and your landing distance's gonna be way more consistent. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=431.48s)]
*  So you're doing calculations in your head as you putt? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=433.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  We can't use Green's books, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=436.44s)]
*  which have a topographical map of the putt in Green. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=438.2s)]
*  Tells me exactly, oh, it's this 2.3% slope. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=441.28s)]
*  So we get, I know on average what a 2% slope looks like, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  a 3% slope looks like. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=448.52s)]
*  It's not me doing math in my head. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=449.79999999999995s)]
*  I just have memorized all the numbers. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=451.67999999999995s)]
*  Do you count cards in blackjack? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=454.55999999999995s)]
*  No, I could, but I don't wanna go down that road. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=456.4s)]
*  I don't wanna get in trouble. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=459.79999999999995s)]
*  That's totally fair. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=461.76s)]
*  But in golf, you're allowed to do this. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=462.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=464.04s)]
*  I'm trying to find a distinct advantage [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=464.88s)]
*  to help benefit the game of golf in a positive way [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  and help my life out in the best way possible. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=472.76000000000005s)]
*  And has it paid off? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=473.72s)]
*  Well, do you think it's paid off? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=475.88s)]
*  Well, it sounds like it has. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=477.0s)]
*  I think it has. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=478.48s)]
*  For me, I'm very blessed, I'm very lucky. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=479.32000000000005s)]

*  I'm gonna build a multi-sport complex center there, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=491.68s)]
*  attach an education center there, attach my charity to it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=494.2s)]
*  My charity, Bryson and Chamber Foundation, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=497.88s)]

*  and it's gonna build an education center. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=501.8s)]
*  I wanna build an education center [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=503.68s)]
*  where I've got an idea and model for that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=504.88s)]

*  the education system in general. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=507.64s)]
*  So the resources that I now have [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=511.12s)]
*  doesn't mean that I'm able to just sit on my butt [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=514.0s)]
*  and do nothing. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8AQMWnvj_Q&t=515.96s)]
