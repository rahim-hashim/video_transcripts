# Tucker has a message for politicians trying to censor broadcasters
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan may be the most popular broadcaster [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=2.2s)]
*  in the English speaking world right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=5.14s)]
*  Every episode of his podcast called [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=6.98s)]
*  The Joe Rogan Experiences reaches about 11 million people. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=8.8s)]
*  And some of the episodes get an audience many times that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=11.8s)]
*  How many people is that? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=14.68s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=16.02s)]
*  For perspective, last night CNN's highest rated show [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=16.9s)]
*  had a little over 700,000 viewers total. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=20.42s)]
*  So Joe Rogan is big. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=24.42s)]
*  And unlike CNN, he's not especially political. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=26.04s)]
*  His show covers pretty much everything. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=28.56s)]
*  Comedy, science, nutrition, the paranormal, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=30.36s)]
*  recreational drug use, exercise, mixed martial arts, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=33.48s)]
*  music, Hollywood, and a huge range of other topics, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=36.8s)]
*  often with guests you've never heard of. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=40.28s)]
*  Rogan is not a reactionary, unlike most people in the media. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=42.4s)]
*  He doesn't think he already knows everything. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=45.0s)]
*  He's genuinely curious. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=46.54s)]
*  And so he lets his guests speak. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=47.96s)]
*  His longest interview lasted for more than five hours. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=50.8s)]
*  It was with a standup comedian. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=53.36s)]
*  When Rogan does talk about politics, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=55.08s)]
*  he's pretty clear he's not an ideologue. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=56.96s)]
*  He interviews everybody, liberals and conservatives, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=58.84s)]
*  as well as a lot of people like Mike Tyson, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  who could be either one. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=62.96s)]
*  And he does it most of the time [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=64.4s)]
*  with respect and self-deprecation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=65.56s)]
*  He's not an expert on politics. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=67.44s)]
*  He's not pretending to be one. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=68.68s)]
*  Rogan just asks questions and he notes the obvious. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=70.44s)]
*  It's this last quality that makes the people in charge [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=74.12s)]
*  hate and fear Joe Rogan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=76.84s)]
*  If you're trying to sell an absurd, obviously untrue idea, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=79.04s)]
*  it is possible that Joe Rogan's gonna call you on it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=82.36s)]
*  Not because he's a partisan, he's not, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=84.92s)]
*  but because he just can't help but notice. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=86.62s)]
*  That's his secret. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=88.78s)]
*  A few months ago, Rogan watched the White House [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=90.38000000000001s)]
*  press secretary lie about the FDA's approval process [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=92.34s)]
*  for Pfizer's COVID vaccine. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  So he said something about it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=97.54s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=98.94s)]
*  Jen Psaki's talking about misinformation online [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=99.9s)]
*  and combating misinformation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=103.26s)]
*  She distributed misinformation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=105.42s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  Because she said that it's approved by the FDA [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=107.86000000000001s)]
*  and their gold standard. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=109.42s)]
*  Yeah, what he said was true. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  Rogan's pretty literal, actually. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  It's one of the reasons people trust him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=114.66s)]
*  And he was right in this case. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  Jen Psaki was lying to the country. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't even an especially clever lie. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  Anyone with internet access could have verified [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=121.9s)]
*  that what Jen Psaki said was a total crock. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=124.26s)]
*  From the podium, too. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=126.66000000000001s)]
*  But when Joe Rogan points this out, it really stings. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=128.74s)]
*  A lot of the people listening to him believe him [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=131.28s)]
*  and the White House took notice. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=134.22s)]
*  So what happened next? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=136.06s)]
*  Well, here's Jen Psaki from yesterday [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=137.78s)]
*  calling on Joe Rogan's employer to censor him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=139.9s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=143.58s)]
*  This disclaimer, it's a positive step, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=144.86s)]
*  but we want every platform to continue doing more [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  to call out misinformation and misinformation [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  while also uplifting accurate information. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=152.10000000000002s)]
*  But ultimately, our view is it's a good step, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=154.94000000000003s)]
*  it's a positive step, but there's more that can be done. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  There's more that can be done? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=163.58s)]
*  Hey, you little fascists, that's a threat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=164.86s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=167.5s)]
*  Politicians and their spokes chicks [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  didn't use to talk this way. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  They were not allowed to talk this way [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=171.86s)]
*  because the First Amendment explicitly prohibits it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=173.34s)]
*  You're not allowed to use government power [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=176.34s)]
*  to shut down broadcasters who criticize you, period. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  And now that's exactly what they're trying to do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  So far, Joe Rogan's employer, Spotify, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=185.86s)]
*  hasn't caved to the pressure. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=187.9s)]
*  Rogan still has a job, but the company is bending. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=189.18s)]
*  It's deleted more than 20,000 COVID-related podcast episodes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=192.02s)]
*  made by other Spotify hosts. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  Spotify claims they quote, cause harm. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=198.02s)]
*  How exactly can a podcast cause harm? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=201.42s)]
*  Spotify didn't explain because of course they couldn't explain. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=204.74s)]
*  Podcasts don't cause harm, weapons cause harm. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=207.22s)]
*  Anybody who knows anything about American business right now [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=210.82s)]
*  understood what's actually going on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=213.1s)]
*  In a moment like this, it is virtually impossible [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=214.98s)]
*  to run a public company, no matter how hard you try. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  It's not just podcasting, it's not just Spotify, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=220.3s)]
*  it's any company with shareholders, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=222.94s)]
*  from breakfast cereal manufacturers [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=224.74s)]
*  to tennis shoe retailers. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=226.38s)]
*  The political pressure is coming at these companies [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=228.02s)]
*  from all sides, from activist investors, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=230.02s)]
*  from the media, from their own employees. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  Every day is a brand new crisis. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=235.38000000000002s)]
*  Imagine the emails between the CEO and the PR department. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=237.34s)]
*  They never stop. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  And under those circumstances, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=242.06s)]
*  it's impossible to think clearly, to stand on principle, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  or even to consider your own best interests long-term. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  That's what's going on with Spotify. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=250.18s)]
*  They probably don't want to censor anybody [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=252.22s)]
*  they're being pushed to. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=254.34s)]
*  In their case, pressure to censor Joe Rogan over his views [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=255.62s)]
*  is coming from other content providers on the site, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=258.5s)]
*  and most of them are D-listers, you should know. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=260.78s)]
*  The other day, that annoying fake duchess from LA [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=263.06s)]
*  and her brain-dead husband threatened to walk [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=265.46s)]
*  if Spotify refused to muzzle Joe Rogan. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=267.86s)]
*  Quote, hundreds of millions of people are affected [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=270.46s)]
*  by the serious harms of rampant myths and disinformation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=272.98s)]
*  Every day, they yelped through a publicist. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=276.82s)]
*  But of course they don't mean it, they're not going anywhere. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=280.34s)]
*  These two grifters have a $25 million podcast deal [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=282.74s)]
*  with Spotify for essentially no work. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=285.66s)]
*  So far, we believe they produced [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=288.66s)]
*  just over 30 minutes of content. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=290.06s)]
*  That means these two have been paid about a million dollars [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=292.78s)]
*  for each minute of talking they've done. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=295.34s)]
*  That's a good gig, it's too good to leave. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=298.34s)]
*  But their performance does raise the question, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=301.42s)]
*  what exactly about Joe Rogan's podcast has caused, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=304.34s)]
*  quote, serious harm? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=307.38s)]
*  We're literal too, so we scoured his archives to find out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=309.98s)]
*  And it turns out, as usual, the opposite is true. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=313.86s)]
*  Joe Rogan is actually a force for safety in this world. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=316.02s)]
*  Watch this clip in which he warns the public [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=319.41999999999996s)]
*  about the dangers of approaching gorillas in the wild. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=321.58s)]
*  It turns out sneaking up on a gorilla, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=324.78s)]
*  as Joe Rogan pointed out, could lead to actual serious harm. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=326.34s)]
*  We're so soft, we think it's okay [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  to look at a wild animal in its eyes. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=332.38s)]
*  That's how stupid we are. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=334.5s)]
*  Hi, hey, we're cool, we're cool, man. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  We're from National Geographic Society. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=338.97999999999996s)]
*  We just come to make sure your baby's okay. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=341.26s)]
*  Oh! [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=343.14000000000004s)]
*  That's some crazy 800 pound silverback [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=343.98s)]
*  what's wrong with these ones? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  What's wrong with the trees? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=347.62s)]
*  Oh! [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=348.46000000000004s)]
*  It's right in your face. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  He's got fangs and only eats vegetables. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=350.70000000000005s)]
*  I know, shredded. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=352.98s)]
*  And the fangs are only designed to f*** you up. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=353.82000000000005s)]
*  And you can't even imagine [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  what an 800 pound gorilla's strength is like, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=357.62s)]
*  because you would think of it as like an 800 pound man, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=359.62s)]
*  but it would really be more like a 3000 pound. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=361.70000000000005s)]
*  He's interested in animals, by the way. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  Again, he's curious, that's part of the allure. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=368.06s)]
*  People in the media are paid to be curious, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=371.58s)]
*  to ask questions, to wonder about other people. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  None of them do, they just wanna lecture you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=375.38s)]
*  This guy actually is interested. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=378.06s)]
*  But no one is criticizing him, seems to know that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=380.78s)]
*  Doesn't seem like they've actually listened to his show. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=382.7s)]
*  Neil Young probably never has. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=384.78s)]
*  Neil Young is an elderly folk singer [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=386.46s)]
*  from the nation of Canada. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  Young has already pulled his music from Spotify [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=389.7s)]
*  in protest of Rogan's open-mindedness. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=391.78s)]
*  Does Neil Young actually own his own music? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=394.34s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=395.94s)]
*  But we know that the gesture received widespread applause [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=397.09999999999997s)]
*  from the usual morons who then revealed to themselves [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=400.54s)]
*  to be even dumber than you thought they were. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=402.94s)]
*  Variety Magazine, for example, which still exists, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=404.82s)]
*  informed us that Neil Young's stand against Joe Rogan [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  makes him quote, a hero to the younger generations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=409.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=413.74s)]
*  Because if there's one person kids of today revere, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=414.94s)]
*  worship like a god, it's 76 year old Neil Young. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  They'd take Neil Young over Joe Rogan any day, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=421.26s)]
*  because young people everywhere are anxious [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  to side with the Biden administration [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=425.14000000000004s)]
*  and demand the firing of any podcast [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=427.1s)]
*  or interviews people Kamala Harris disagrees with. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=432.62s)]
*  They're more out of touch than Neil Young is. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=434.54s)]
*  But at CNN, they've convinced themselves [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=437.26s)]
*  it's all totally true, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=439.46000000000004s)]
*  because Joe Rogan is peddling misinformation. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  Therefore, he must be stopped. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=443.18s)]
*  You think about major newsrooms like CNN [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=445.70000000000005s)]
*  that have health departments and deaths and operations [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=447.5s)]
*  that work hard on verified information on COVID-19. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=450.02000000000004s)]
*  And then you have talk show stars like Joe Rogan [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=452.62s)]
*  who just wing it, who make it up as they go along. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=455.18s)]
*  And because figures like Rogan are trusted by people [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  that don't trust real newsrooms, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=460.5s)]
*  we have a tension, a problem that's much bigger than Spotify, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=462.38s)]
*  much bigger than any single platform. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=465.1s)]
*  People are trusting Joe Rogan over Unix. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=471.74s)]
*  Damn the people. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=473.7s)]
*  They should be watching CNN. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=475.38s)]
*  CNN has departments and desks and entire operations [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=476.46000000000004s)]
*  designed to verify information [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  and filter out misinformation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's why they described Ivermactin, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  which in Joe Rogan's case was prescribed by a human doctor, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=486.34s)]
*  as quote, horse dewormer, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=488.97999999999996s)]
*  and did it on like nine different shows. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=490.38s)]
*  And those same standards led them to suggest, famously, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=492.94s)]
*  that a passenger jet must have been sucked [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=496.78s)]
*  into a black hole. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=499.21999999999997s)]
*  What if it was hijacking or terrorism [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=501.29999999999995s)]
*  or mechanical failure or pilot error, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=502.82s)]
*  but what if it was something fully [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=504.78s)]
*  that we don't really understand? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=506.41999999999996s)]
*  A lot of people have been asking about that, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=508.26s)]
*  about black holes and on and on and on. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=509.94s)]
*  Also referencing the Twilight Zone, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=512.5799999999999s)]
*  which has a very similar plot. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=514.22s)]
*  That's what people are saying. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=516.5400000000001s)]
*  I know it's preposterous, but is it preposterous, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=517.38s)]
*  you think? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=519.74s)]
*  We can't get enough. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=525.74s)]
*  Yes, that clip was from eight years ago, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=526.58s)]
*  but we watch it every single morning, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=528.46s)]
*  along with our Pilates and sauna, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=530.82s)]
*  just to get ready for the day. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=532.4200000000001s)]
*  And if you want to watch a lot more like that, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=534.58s)]
*  CNN has just announced you can subscribe to CNN+. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=536.4200000000001s)]
*  And Don Lamont will be on there constantly [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=540.22s)]
*  for a small extra fee. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=542.6999999999999s)]
*  So that's their answer to Joe Rogan, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=544.54s)]
*  more nonsense by the lowest rated dummies [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=546.9s)]
*  in the entire TV business. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=549.2199999999999s)]
*  Joe Rogan, meanwhile, consistently turns out [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=551.86s)]
*  interesting, informative programming [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=553.6999999999999s)]
*  just by being curious, just by asking obvious questions. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=555.18s)]
*  That's all it takes. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=558.86s)]
*  Care about what other people are saying. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  Watch the world around you. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=561.9399999999999s)]
*  Take an interest in something beyond yourself. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=563.38s)]
*  And when he does that, they don't like it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=566.8199999999999s)]
*  Watch this exchange with Dr. Robert Malone, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=569.86s)]
*  who is one of the inventors of mRNA technology. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=572.78s)]
*  The how question of a third of the population [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=575.58s)]
*  basically being hypnotized and totally wrapped up [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=579.3000000000001s)]
*  in whatever Tony Fauci in the mainstream media feeds them, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=583.62s)]
*  whatever CNN tells them is true. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=586.22s)]
*  The answer is mass formation psychosis. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=587.9s)]
*  When you have a society that has become decoupled [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=590.82s)]
*  from each other and has free-floating anxiety [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=593.86s)]
*  in a sense that things don't make sense, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=597.3000000000001s)]
*  we can't understand it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=600.0600000000001s)]
*  And then their attention gets focused by a leader [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=602.5s)]
*  or a series of events on one small point, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=604.54s)]
*  just like hypnosis. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=607.26s)]
*  They literally become hypnotized and can be led anywhere. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=609.14s)]
*  That was the interview that pushed CNN [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=615.46s)]
*  completely over the edge. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=616.94s)]
*  Not because it was false, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=618.36s)]
*  but because it was entirely credible. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=619.74s)]
*  Hypnotizing the public, that's our job, they said. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=622.5s)]
*  Mass formation psychosis? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=626.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's us. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=628.22s)]
*  So of course they immediately set about encouraging [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=630.12s)]
*  the tech platforms to ban that interview. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=633.52s)]
*  Dr. Malone, again, one of the inventors of mRNA technology [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=636.46s)]
*  being used in over a billion doses of vaccine, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=640.88s)]
*  currently in people's bodies, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=646.16s)]
*  that's the man who was talking. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=647.74s)]
*  Credible? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=650.52s)]
*  Yeah, no one more credible than that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=651.36s)]
*  And that's exactly why they hated it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=653.4s)]
*  That's exactly why they decided you couldn't hear it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=655.2s)]
*  Now that same month, it was just past December, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=657.44s)]
*  Rogan spoke to a doctor called Peter McCullough [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=659.56s)]
*  about ivermectin, watch this. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=662.1999999999999s)]
*  Sanjay Gupta and the CNN correspondent, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=664.8s)]
*  there was no fair balance there. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=668.4799999999999s)]
*  He parroted a talking point [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=669.9599999999999s)]
*  that our head of the National Allergy [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=671.9599999999999s)]
*  and Immunology Branch parroted. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=673.64s)]
*  They said that there was no data for ivermectin. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  They said it was a horse dewormer. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=680.4s)]
*  Now either they knew or they should have known [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=684.5999999999999s)]
*  the 63 supportive studies and over 30 randomized trials. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=688.08s)]
*  So those are facts. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=693.96s)]
*  And if you think they're wrong, tell us how they're wrong. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=695.5200000000001s)]
*  But why shouldn't people hear that? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=698.4000000000001s)]
*  Why shouldn't they be allowed to? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=699.88s)]
*  Well, because Dr. Peter McCullough, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=702.44s)]
*  who certainly has the credentials to do it, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=704.0s)]
*  criticized the people in charge. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=705.98s)]
*  He mocked CNN for ignoring dozens of clinical trials, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  making fun of a drug that could have helped a lot of people [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=711.08s)]
*  possibly save lives. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=713.12s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=714.86s)]
*  Well, that's immoral, of course. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=715.74s)]
*  But notice what Joe Rogan didn't do [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=717.68s)]
*  in the face of that information. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=719.4799999999999s)]
*  He didn't call for CNN to be censored [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=721.16s)]
*  because they spread disinformation. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=722.88s)]
*  He didn't say we gotta pull CNN off the air. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=724.68s)]
*  They're killing people. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=726.16s)]
*  Because he's not for censorship. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=728.16s)]
*  You know who's for censorship? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=729.56s)]
*  Weak people are for censorship. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=730.64s)]
*  I can't handle what you're throwing at me, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=732.8399999999999s)]
*  shut up or else. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=734.9599999999999s)]
*  That's exactly what they're saying. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  Strong people don't behave that way, only the weak. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=737.4s)]
*  Everybody knows that, they can smell it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=741.3399999999999s)]
*  And the reason Joe Rogan's successful, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=744.4s)]
*  is because he's not weak. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=747.16s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnU1O5u_quk&t=748.8s)]
