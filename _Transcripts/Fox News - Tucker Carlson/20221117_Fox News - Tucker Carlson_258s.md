# Mike Rowe sounds the alarm on a declining work ethic
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A)
*  Welcome back. Well, not a lot of people are working right now in the United States, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=0.0s)]
*  that's a big change. That's why maybe you have to use the drive-thru because no one's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=5.88s)]
*  inside the restaurant. But not only is the way we work changing, our attitudes toward [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=10.58s)]
*  work are changing. And a lot of people seem to have contempt for work all of a sudden. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=15.8s)]
*  Signs are everywhere. You probably noticed them. Mike Rowe has spent a life thinking [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  about work. He's host of How America Works on Fox Business Network. He joins us on the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=22.96s)]
*  set of the Patriot Awards. Of course, the long time, the immortal host of Dirty Jobs. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=26.92s)]
*  And I think our most frequent and popular guest. Anyway, thank you so much for coming [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=32.96s)]
*  back. Obviously, you have noticed the change in attitude toward work. Some people sort [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=36.0s)]
*  of mocking the idea of work. What's your response to that? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  Yes. So I'm wrong about as much as I am right. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=44.44s)]
*  Yep, me too. And for that reason, I hate to say I told [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=48.0s)]
*  you so out loud ever. But for 15 years, my foundation has been talking about this slow [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=51.88s)]
*  sort of unraveling of what we loosely call work ethic, whatever that means. And now between [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  Nick Eberstadt's work and Economist, who's really drilled down on it. And I mean, last [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=65.76s)]
*  week there was an article in the New York Times called something like how to combat [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=72.2s)]
*  the assault on modern work. And I thought it was going to be an article about coal miners [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=76.4s)]
*  or crab fishermen or, you know, big tough jobs where the danger is real. It wasn't. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  It was it was an article about everything from paper cuts to the nonexistent pet bereavement [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=87.56s)]
*  policies that are being deemed harsh. I'm not making it up. And so we are we're in a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=94.28s)]
*  place where seven million able bodied men are not only not working between the ages [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=99.76s)]
*  of 25 and seven million, seven million able bodied men are not only not working, they're [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  affirmatively not looking for a job. That's never happened in peacetime ever. And economists [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=111.04s)]
*  like Nick Eberstadt take a dim view of it. They're worried and they're trying to inject [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  that into the conversation at a time when we're still looking at the unemployment number [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=123.48s)]
*  as the true harbinger of what's really going on. But it's not. In his view, it's a depression [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=129.4s)]
*  era artifact. We're just looking at the wrong thing. We're looking at not what it means [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=134.44000000000003s)]
*  to have a bunch of people unemployed. But what does it mean to have a bunch of opportunity [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=141.24s)]
*  that nobody gives a damn about? That's a different conversation. And it's complicated to have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=147.72000000000003s)]
*  because while that dynamic is clear and present, so too is the fact that a lot of big companies [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=153.4s)]
*  in Silicon Valley are going to lay off a lot of people. And now you're going to have [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=159.28s)]
*  a bunch of people who aren't trained for the jobs that do exist sort of competing with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=162.72s)]
*  people who have affirmatively taken themselves out of the workforce entirely. And who final [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=167.04s)]
*  point, I asked Nick, what are they doing? What are they doing with their time? These [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=172.28s)]
*  able bodied? Yes. Good question. On average, over 2000 hours a year on screens. So there's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=176.16s)]
*  totally hypnotized by a real world. They're out. They're out. So at some point, the pilot [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=183.56s)]
*  shortage, for example, well known, one of the reasons it's hard to get your plane on [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=189.88s)]
*  time or the cost is going up is because there aren't enough pilots. But that's true for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=193.04s)]
*  a lot of different jobs. So like, when does it start to grind to a halt? Well, you know, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=198.18s)]
*  pilots get the press because it's the pilot. Right. But when you really follow the delays [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=203.08s)]
*  you'll find it in the mechanics. You'll find it in the flight attendants. How many airports [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=209.36s)]
*  have you been in when the crew simply couldn't make it to the next plane? Yeah. It's because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  they're working with 70% of the workforce they had three years ago. You know, four million [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=220.08s)]
*  fewer people are in the workforce today than before the lockdowns and four million more [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=225.18s)]
*  jobs have opened up. It's almost a perfect mirror image. And the reflection is kind of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=231.44s)]
*  hideous. And it's just sad because work is meaning as you have spent your life showing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=237.84s)]
*  Micro, the great micro. Dirty jobs back. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgwRB7RI7A&t=243.84s)]
