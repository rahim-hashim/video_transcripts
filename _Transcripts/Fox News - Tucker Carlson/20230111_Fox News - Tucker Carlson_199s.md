# Restaurant owner speaks out on potential gas stove ban
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80)
*  So there are people in this world to use gas stoves for a living. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=0.0s)]
*  And one of them is Stratis Morfogan, who runs a restaurant, owns a restaurant. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=3.52s)]
*  He's the author of Be a Disruptor. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  He joins us to assess stress. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=9.36s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=10.92s)]
*  So you're a restaurant owner. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  This is not a luxury item to you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=14.44s)]
*  This is core to your business. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=16.8s)]
*  First of all, would you obey a ban on gas stoves? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=18.96s)]
*  And second, why are they superior to electric? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=21.28s)]
*  You know what it is, Tucker, for people that don't understand the restaurant [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  industry, for 35 years, we've been attacked by everybody. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  We had organized crime in our industry in the 70s, 80s and 90s. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=30.16s)]
*  In the 2000s, we had corrupt Wall Street. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=34.68s)]
*  And for the last three years, we've had government overreach. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=37.36s)]
*  I mean, we've seen it during Covid. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=41.28s)]
*  They did things they never followed the science. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=43.16s)]
*  And what's going on? What I heard, I heard the rumor about this last year [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=45.76s)]
*  and what I'm hearing about today from the White House to Governor Hockel, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=49.84s)]
*  that they want to they want to make us for new restaurant [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=54.16s)]
*  construction use electric stoves. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=57.24s)]
*  So let me explain it to you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=59.92s)]
*  We lose 40 percent productivity by using electric, by using electric. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=61.56s)]
*  If they ever inquired with small business owners, I'll give them three pieces [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=67.04s)]
*  of advice. Get stronger filtration system, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=70.88s)]
*  get a hood system that works and basically train your staff on how to maintain it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=74.2s)]
*  But for 35 years, we continuously have obstacles in running our industry. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=80.32s)]
*  I got to tell you, Tucker, and I want to thank you for supporting small business. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=85.2s)]
*  Since the last time I was on, you inspired me to write the book. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=89.44s)]
*  And I got to tell you, because our journey is constantly being attacked. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  Like we're vulnerable. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  And this is creme de la creme, because I will tell you, this will [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=99.12s)]
*  destroy our industry just as bad as they attempted to do with Covid. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=102.68s)]
*  I mean, there's got to be a limit to what people are going to put up with. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=108.12s)]
*  There has to be a red line. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=110.48s)]
*  I would I would counsel mass disobedience in the face of tyranny in this case. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=111.76s)]
*  I mean, do you think restaurants would obey? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=116.04s)]
*  Why does Kathy Hokel have a right to tell you what kind of stove you have? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=117.92s)]
*  She's an idiot. Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=120.48s)]
*  I like listen, I didn't obey Kathy Hokel with any of the mandates. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Like and I'm not going to obey Kathy Hokel now, because let me tell you something. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=125.48s)]
*  With electric stoves, first of all, bills will go six times higher. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=129.84s)]
*  And then then on top of that, our productivity drops. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  This isn't just going to hurt the restaurant hospitality industry. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=137.44s)]
*  It's going to hurt real estate development. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=140.16s)]
*  You remember casinos, shopping malls, airports, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=142.12s)]
*  residential towers, office buildings. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  They depend on us for the content. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=148.36s)]
*  And if we don't develop the content for these big, you know, this is our industry [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=151.28s)]
*  for these big developers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, guess what? This whole thing will collapse. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  Then there makes again, they're not following the science. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=160.56s)]
*  And this is not following science. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=162.84s)]
*  There are so many other ways that we do. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  We don't allow our cooks to basically stand in smoke. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=166.24s)]
*  We have a strong filtration smoke evacuation system. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=170.72000000000003s)]
*  And this is what's needed if they want to go down this route. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=174.04s)]
*  The idea that people who sent crackpipes to drug addicts are concerned about safety [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  is like the most hilarious thing I've ever heard in my life. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Ignore them, please. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=184.11999999999998s)]
*  Stratus Morfogan, great to see you tonight. Thank you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=185.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Tucker. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXKe904v80&t=187.11999999999998s)]
