# Texas deploys National Guard troops to southern border
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg)
*  Fox's Bill Mollugian has been on the story virtually alone since the very beginning. He joins us tonight from the border at Spofford, Texas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=0.0s)]
*  With some remarkable new footage. Hey Bill [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Hey Tucker, good evening to you. That's right [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=10.96s)]
*  We're currently about 40 miles inland from the border right now and believe it or not [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=12.72s)]
*  This area has turned into one of the biggest hot spots [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=16.7s)]
*  That's because all the trains out here the illegal immigrants have been using them in an effort to get further into the United States [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=19.44s)]
*  We'll show you what we're talking about. Take a look at this wild footage shot right here yesterday by Texas DPS [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=26.02s)]
*  What you're looking at are Texas state troopers finding 19 illegal immigrants hiding inside of brand new cars that were inside of a train [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=32.06s)]
*  Being shipped to the San Antonio area [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=40.3s)]
*  You can see the troopers looking at those migrants panning up and down and it goes to show those migrants will do whatever they can to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=42.82s)]
*  Hide to evade from law enforcement. Take a look at this second piece of video. We embedded with DPS earlier today [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=48.36s)]
*  This is what we saw today [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=54.56s)]
*  We came across one train that had more than 20 illegal immigrants who were hiding inside of a coal car [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=55.56s)]
*  Believe it or not in the blistering heat out here. They were all single adult men [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  DPS had to get up there and pull them out one by one [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  There were 23 in total all of them were arrested and taken to jail for criminal trespassing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  They are not being handed over to the federal government. Take a look at this third piece of video [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=73.56s)]
*  This was just a couple of hours before that incident [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=77.88s)]
*  We saw more illegal immigrants hitching rides on trains out here Texas DPS pulled five other single adult males off of this train [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=80.4s)]
*  Arrested them as well. They are all going to jail as well again [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=88.2s)]
*  They are not being handed over to Border Patrol as all of this is happening [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=91.64s)]
*  There is a brand new migrant caravan down in Mexico heading our way as we speak [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=95.84s)]
*  Take a look at what happened when they encountered a roadblock from the Mexican government the other day. Take a look [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=100.52s)]
*  Like [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=110.8s)]
*  A hot knife through butter you can see they pushed right through that resistance from the Mexican government and take a look at this video [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=121.28s)]
*  We just shot here about an hour ago in Del Rio went up on a DPS helicopter [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=128.2s)]
*  What you're looking at is the state of Texas is now preparing for this migrant caravan governor Greg Abbott is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=132.7s)]
*  Deploying massive amounts of Texas National Guard resources down to the Del Rio International Bridge area [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  This is the exact same area where we saw those 15,000 Haitians last month the idea behind this being the state of Texas will step [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=145.08s)]
*  Up where the federal government is not securing the border [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=152.38s)]
*  They say they will not allow another Del Rio situation to happen [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=155.34s)]
*  So they are pre positioning resources all along the border there to send the message to those caravans [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=159.08s)]
*  You will not be allowed into Texas Texas DPS telling us unlike the federal government [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=164.26s)]
*  They will not roll out the red carpet for these caravans. We'll send it back to you and that's heartening to hear Bill Mollusian [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lM3nALL5fg&t=169.5s)]
