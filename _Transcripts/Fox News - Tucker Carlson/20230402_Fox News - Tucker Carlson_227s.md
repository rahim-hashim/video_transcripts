# We donâ€™t know how Ukraine is spending our money: JD Vance
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM)
*  So Mark Milley says he didn't know there were drag queen story hours going on at military bases, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=0.0s)]
*  but maybe more significantly, he's also not sure where all the weapons that we're sending to Ukraine have wound up. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=4.8s)]
*  So yesterday, Joe Manchin, Democrat from West Virginia, asked Milley if he could speak to his, quote, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=10.72s)]
*  confidence in the U.S.-NATO-Ukrainian weapons accountability. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=15.52s)]
*  Here was his response. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=19.64s)]
*  We do not have any uniformed troops or civilians for that matter accompanying Ukrainian forces in the front line. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=21.64s)]
*  We do have folks working out of the embassy, so they're working at the administrative defense level. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  And that's as far as our hands-on accountability goes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=34.72s)]
*  We do have some other means through reporting that the Ukrainians report to us, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=38.56s)]
*  and I'll be happy to talk about that in a classified session. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=44.84s)]
*  But there are some means and mechanisms of doing some accountability. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=47.0s)]
*  It is not as rigorous as you might think. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=51.12s)]
*  Yeah, not as rigorous. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=53.84s)]
*  JD Vance has served in the United States Marine Corps. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=55.2s)]
*  Now he serves in the United States Senate, representing the state of Ohio. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=57.08s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=59.6s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for coming. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=60.72s)]
*  So when you hear the chairman of the Joint Chiefs say we're not exactly sure where the advanced weapon systems are going, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=62.28s)]
*  how do you feel about that? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=69.52s)]
*  Well, Tucker, it's outrageous, but unfortunately, it confirms what we basically already know, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=73.28s)]
*  which is that we've sent $113 billion, probably more than that, Tucker, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=77.24s)]
*  probably more like $130 billion to the most corrupt country on the face of the planet. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=81.64s)]
*  And we have no real idea how those resources have been spent. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=88.08s)]
*  The most important part of this, Tucker, and I've done a very deep dive into this, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=92.08s)]
*  is we do not make enough bullets in this country to support multiple fronts of multiple wars. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=95.56s)]
*  I'm talking about bullets. I mean, ammunition, munitions, artillery shells, some of the advanced missile systems. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=103.72s)]
*  So when we talk about sending $120 billion worth of weapons to Ukraine, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=110.04s)]
*  those are weapons that we could not send to Taiwan or other parts of the world [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=114.72s)]
*  that would actually be in the service of American national interest. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  This entire idea that we can focus on Russia and we can focus on China is a farce. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=122.12s)]
*  These guys shipped our entire industrial base to China in the first place. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=128.72s)]
*  We don't make enough of our own weapons. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that we're sending it to Ukraine with so little accountability [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=135.72s)]
*  is the very reason why China's threat and power is growing in the world today. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=139.44s)]
*  Yeah, and we're about to lose the US dollars, the world's reserve currency and tank our economy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=144.76s)]
*  I agree with that. I wonder, has there been a concerted effort from the Congress [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=149.36s)]
*  to find out who's gotten rich from this? Many people have, clearly. Do we know who they are? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=153.48s)]
*  We don't know who they are, Tucker, in part because the Biden administration won't give us answers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=159.88s)]
*  I actually submitted a letter. One of the first things that I did as a US senator [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=164.16s)]
*  is asked for a full accounting of where the resources that we've sent to Ukraine have gone. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=167.8s)]
*  The Biden administration has been very resistant, even in classified settings. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=173.16s)]
*  To be honest with us and, Tucker, I have to be honest with you, I'm not sure if it's because [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=177.08s)]
*  they have no idea where those $120 billion have gone or if they just don't want to tell us. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  But what we can be almost certain is that some very dark, very, very evil people [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=187.6s)]
*  have gotten very wealthy from that $120 billion. I hope that it's done some good, too, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=194.24s)]
*  but the simple fact is we don't know and there has not been a full accounting of this stuff. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=199.12s)]
*  The recklessness is just awe-inspiring. I mean, it's just drunk driving the whole country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=205.04s)]
*  I mean, it's unbelievable. Senator Vance of Ohio, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=209.2s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfYdwQkgmM&t=215.6s)]
