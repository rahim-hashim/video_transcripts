# Tucker: Could Viagra treat COVID?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4)
*  Well, amazingly, there appear to be growing connections [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=0.0s)]
*  between Viagra and treatment for the coronavirus. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=2.9s)]
*  A nurse in the UK just woke up from a 28-day coma [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=6.4s)]
*  after she got a big dose of Viagra, probably her first. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  One healthcare company is providing coronavirus tests [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=12.56s)]
*  along with their ED medication. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=14.84s)]
*  Who thought Viagra would save us from the pandemic? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=16.88s)]
*  Dr. Mark Siegel might have predicted it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=21.28s)]
*  He's our Fox News medical chairman. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=22.96s)]
*  The man we go to, he joins us tonight to explain. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=24.28s)]
*  Doctor? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=26.04s)]
*  Tucker, we've been talking about Viagra. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  We talked about it last week about Alzheimer's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=29.84s)]
*  and we're doing further investigations on it now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=32.32s)]
*  As you said, Monica Almeida, 37 years old, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=34.84s)]
*  she was 72 hours away from having her respirator turned off. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=38.08s)]
*  They gave her a massive dose of Viagra and she woke up. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=41.28s)]
*  Now, what might the connection be there? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=44.36s)]
*  Well, I started looking into that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=45.96s)]
*  A study just published out of Chile [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  in a journal called Critical Care [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=50.28s)]
*  found that this patient's study [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=52.56s)]
*  did not go on the respirator who got Viagra [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=55.0s)]
*  and they actually went out of the hospital sooner. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=57.4s)]
*  Now, why would that be? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=60.0s)]
*  Viagra is not just used for what you think it's used for. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=61.4s)]
*  It also treats lung problems. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=64.0s)]
*  It improves blood flow to the lungs. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=66.0s)]
*  It improves oxygen in the lungs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=67.76s)]
*  It treats pulmonary hypertension. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=69.72s)]
*  It treats altitude sickness. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=71.32s)]
*  It makes something called nitric oxide. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=73.16s)]
*  Now, nitric oxide is something [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=75.44s)]
*  that the COVID virus decreases and Viagra increases. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=77.52s)]
*  And not only was there the study out of Chile, Tucker, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=82.24s)]
*  but there was several studies around the world [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=84.72s)]
*  that if you inhaled that nitric oxide, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=87.16s)]
*  your lungs did a lot better with COVID. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=89.52s)]
*  Japan, China, Scandinavia all had studies like this [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  showing a big improvement with nitric oxide, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  just what Viagra does. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=98.28s)]
*  So I think this is the beginning of something [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=100.0s)]
*  and further studies are going on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=102.24s)]
*  and I think this is a potential treatment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=103.96s)]
*  And then you mentioned along comes a company called Roman. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  And the New York Times of all places [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=110.36s)]
*  wrote this up the other day and said, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=112.08s)]
*  Roman, which is a company that actually [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=113.92s)]
*  you can prescribe Viagra over a telemedicine [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  is now giving home COVID tests. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=119.28s)]
*  Home COVID tests, you can't get them anywhere, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=121.2s)]
*  but you can get them via telemedicine [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=123.92s)]
*  via this company, Roman. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  And guess what you can get with the home test? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=127.56s)]
*  You can get Viagra. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  So I have only one question [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=130.88s)]
*  and I'm gonna call Roman to find out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=132.44s)]
*  Tucker, which do you take first, the Viagra [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  or do you do the home test? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=138.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=139.52s)]
*  Tucker? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=140.96s)]
*  Well, as you said, if you take it, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=141.8s)]
*  I'm quoting a massive dose of Viagra, you wake up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=143.08s)]
*  So I think it's pretty obvious. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=146.72s)]
*  Is there anything that's in cure? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=147.92s)]
*  Dr. Mark Siegel, great to see you. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=149.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=152.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=153.44s)]
*  I'm getting ready to try it out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=154.28s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et4r-mAnyr4&t=155.16s)]
