# Chinese refugee says America is beginning to resemble China
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c)
*  Amazing thing happening in China, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=0.0s)]
*  where the Chinese government, using COVID as a pretext, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=1.96s)]
*  has cracked down in ways that are totalitarian, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  even by their standards, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=6.72s)]
*  locking the entire city of Shanghai in its homes, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=8.28s)]
*  ripping children from their parents' arms, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=11.0s)]
*  sending people to concentration camps. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=12.92s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=14.38s)]
*  But what's even more horrifying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=15.8s)]
*  is how our public health authorities in the United States [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=17.04s)]
*  have responded with praise. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=19.02s)]
*  Oh, we can learn something from the Chinese. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=21.68s)]
*  So watching that, you begin to ask yourself, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  what could stop something like that from happening here [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=26.2s)]
*  if the people in our country are for it? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=28.88s)]
*  Well, Lily Tang has been asking that question. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=32.0s)]
*  She was born in China. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=33.82s)]
*  She came to the United States, to New Hampshire. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=34.74s)]
*  She's now running for Congress. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=36.64s)]
*  Here's her campaign ad. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=38.78s)]
*  I was born in China to illiterate working class parents, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=40.84s)]
*  suffered under Mao's cultural revolution [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=44.8s)]
*  and the communist dictatorship. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=47.8s)]
*  I wanted freedom. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=50.2s)]
*  America was my promised land. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=51.84s)]
*  People are losing their rights to make a living [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=54.4s)]
*  and to make their own life choices. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=57.72s)]
*  Are you worried yet? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  I am. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  I fear that the country I love [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=64.04s)]
*  is becoming like the country I left. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=66.84s)]
*  Lily Tang Williams is a Republican candidate for Congress [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=71.12s)]
*  in the state of New Hampshire, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  and we are honored to have her join us now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=75.0s)]
*  Lily Tang Williams, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=77.72s)]
*  So that's a wonderful ad that you cut. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=80.0s)]
*  It sounds like your childhood in a repressive country [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=82.48s)]
*  really informs how you view America right now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=86.88s)]
*  What did it teach you? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=89.08s)]
*  Well, I come to America for freedom and prosperity, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  live my American dream. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=96.36s)]
*  I'm just worried that this American dream [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=98.36s)]
*  will not be there for my children [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=100.84s)]
*  who are born in this country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=102.56s)]
*  I have been here for 34 years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=104.02s)]
*  I have seen now the country [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  is probably the worst situation today than ever been. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  And I see this rise of also terrorism [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=111.32s)]
*  and tyranny in our country. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  And the canceling people's rights [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=117.28s)]
*  and silence dissent voices. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  And then what we're doing to our school children [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  kind of remind me what I see in China. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't want another cultural revolution happening [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  in my new country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=131.84s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=133.68s)]
*  And you fled the Chinese government. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  Now you see our leaders making excuses [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=137.12s)]
*  to the Chinese government, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=139.6s)]
*  praising the Chinese government. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  Does that make you uncomfortable? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=142.56s)]
*  Not just uncomfortable, I'm terrified. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  And I have seen that the government [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=148.32s)]
*  are taking almost like a tactics [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  and even terms from their playbooks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=153.76s)]
*  And our country is so divided [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=156.56s)]
*  by the traditional mouse tactic and identity politics [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=159.88s)]
*  and separate people into oppressor versus oppress. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=163.92s)]
*  And so he used that technique [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=167.2s)]
*  to do his cultural revolution. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=169.4s)]
*  I'm just warning people, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=171.44s)]
*  we don't want that cultural revolution happening here [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=172.76s)]
*  to destroy this new country I love. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=175.48s)]
*  Ah, are voters in New Hampshire responding to that message? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=178.28s)]
*  Yes, we have lots of people here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  That's why I come here because I love their motto, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  live free or die. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=189.72s)]
*  And we also have lots of people like me [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  who love freedom and appreciate liberty coming here [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  through the Free State Project. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=198.48s)]
*  So I wanted people to know what I'm doing here [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=200.12s)]
*  so more people like me will come here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=202.76s)]
*  Yes, and not just people from Boston [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=205.12s)]
*  turning into Massachusetts North. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=207.16s)]
*  Lily Tang Williams, you don't need to respond to that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTYmt3WiZ0c&t=209.24s)]
