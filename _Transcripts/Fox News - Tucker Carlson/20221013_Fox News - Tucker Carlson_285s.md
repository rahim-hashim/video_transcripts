# Mom rips school districtâ€™s plan for Halloween drag show
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo)
*  Well, the attorney general of the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=0.0s)]
*  Merrick Garland, has ordered federal agents [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=1.96s)]
*  to investigate parents who dare to complain [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  about their school boards. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=6.32s)]
*  In particular, parents are no longer allowed [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=7.72s)]
*  to say anything when creepy adults [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=10.4s)]
*  sexualize their children. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=13.08s)]
*  Come to my van, little girl, I've got some candy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Don't say a word. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=17.72s)]
*  But that has not kept some parents quiet. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=19.36s)]
*  In San Diego County, California, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=22.36s)]
*  one mother, called Brittany Mayer, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=23.68s)]
*  noticed that her school board [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=25.44s)]
*  was supposed to be educating her children, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=27.28s)]
*  had instead invited them to a, quote, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=29.24s)]
*  family-friendly drag show, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=30.959999999999997s)]
*  sponsored by a San Francisco [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=32.76s)]
*  Gender Reassignment Surgery Center and a nightclub. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=34.04s)]
*  Here's what she said at a recent meeting [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=36.96s)]
*  of the Incinitus Union School Board, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=38.64s)]
*  which promoted the event. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=41.12s)]
*  What is it about a grown man, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=43.36s)]
*  costumed in a sparkly bra with augmented boobs, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=45.68s)]
*  busting out a leather miniskirt, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=48.72s)]
*  barely covering his twerking a**, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  a tuck tape on his front, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=52.32s)]
*  while spreading his fish-netted legs [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=53.84s)]
*  as he rides on the ground, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=56.36s)]
*  grinding his groin next to a minor, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=58.76s)]
*  family-friendly? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  You owe us an answer. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=63.44s)]
*  We have a culture that has a massive problem [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=64.72s)]
*  with child porn, with sex trafficking. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=67.44s)]
*  You, a little school district board of adults, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=69.56s)]
*  made the decision to feature an event [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=73.44s)]
*  to hyper-sexualize young children. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=75.56s)]
*  Do you wanna know the word that defines that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=77.56s)]
*  It's groomer. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=80.88s)]
*  You all played the activist pimp [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=82.12s)]
*  for an aligned surgical center, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=84.84s)]
*  and for a 21-plus gay bar. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=87.4s)]
*  It makes you groomers and activist pimps, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  and we won't have those sitting on a school board [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  who oversees the education of our children. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=96.68s)]
*  Brittany Mayer was not arrested, apparently, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=101.04s)]
*  because she's joining us tonight, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=102.72s)]
*  and we're glad that she is. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  Brittany, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=105.4s)]
*  So, this is the school [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=108.4s)]
*  that's supposed to be educating your kids, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  and they're sexualizing your kids. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=114.12s)]
*  How did you find out about this? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=116.76s)]
*  So, the Union School District took it upon themselves [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=119.64s)]
*  to send out the invitation to all families in Encinitas, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=122.88s)]
*  and they actually have, it's interesting, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=127.76s)]
*  they have an approval process that they violated. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=130.16s)]
*  It says in their rules of conduct [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=132.6s)]
*  that they can't send out anything that is lewd, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=134.32s)]
*  that is political, that is controversial, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=136.6s)]
*  and they decided to send out a boobash invitation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=139.28s)]
*  that is sponsored by a gender reassignment clinic [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=143.04s)]
*  out in San Francisco and a 21-plus gay nightclub [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=146.88s)]
*  in San Diego. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=150.64s)]
*  So, to say we were confused would be an understatement. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=151.6s)]
*  What does this have to do with educating your children? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=154.92s)]
*  Well, that's a really good question, Tucker, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=158.98s)]
*  and we asked the board again and again [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=161.56s)]
*  to reconsider and to issue an apology and an explanation, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=164.44s)]
*  which they didn't, which is why we decided to show up. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=168.0s)]
*  And I wanna make it really clear [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=170.64s)]
*  that this is not an isolated incident. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=172.34s)]
*  This is coming to every school across the nation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=174.98s)]
*  And if you think that it's just gonna stay in California, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=178.62s)]
*  you're dead wrong. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=181.38s)]
*  This is coming everywhere. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=182.36s)]
*  And it's why we stood up and we said, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  we're gonna nip this in the bud. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  We're not going to play by the rules [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=186.58s)]
*  that we're supposed to be afraid [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=188.66s)]
*  that we're gonna be punished if we don't speak up now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=190.1s)]
*  And I hope that this breeds courage [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=192.7s)]
*  for parents all over the nation [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=194.9s)]
*  who see this trend starting to change, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=196.66s)]
*  where like you just said, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=199.6s)]
*  our kids aren't being educated in the fundamentals, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  they're being hyper-sexualized and we are done with this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=203.88s)]
*  How is this different from pedophilia, do you know? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=208.6s)]
*  Say that again? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  How is this different from pedophilia? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=213.0s)]
*  Well, it sounds like it's one in the same. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's why I made it really clear [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=218.64s)]
*  that you can slap labels on anything. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=221.56s)]
*  You can make anything family-friendly that you want. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=223.68s)]
*  And that's the danger of this ideology [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=226.4s)]
*  is that we're being told to use new terms and new language, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=229.0s)]
*  which is, I think we do a disservice [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=232.6s)]
*  when we play by those rules. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=235.0s)]
*  We need to stand up and use the words [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=236.72s)]
*  as the words that we know what they mean. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=239.32s)]
*  And what those adults are doing [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=242.56s)]
*  is they're pimping out our kids [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=244.86s)]
*  to gender reassignment clinics, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=246.72s)]
*  and they're pimping them out to 21 plus nightclubs. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=248.84s)]
*  And like I said, it's coming all over the nation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=251.12s)]
*  And we need to now use brave words and words with meaning [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=253.7s)]
*  and call it like it is. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=258.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I just have sat in awe [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=260.24s)]
*  and watched passive parents [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=262.48s)]
*  let creepy adults sexualize their children. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=264.72s)]
*  And it's just so gratifying to see someone say enough. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  So thank you for doing that and for telling us about it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=270.24s)]
*  Enough is enough, enough is enough. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. Amen. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grl_Ob9tuo&t=273.6s)]
