# Tucker: The curious case of Ray Epps and the January 6 Committee
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM)
*  So we're going to another story that's been brewing tonight. So for weeks as you know, the January 6th committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=0.0s)]
*  Has been holding hearings. They've been widely covered on the other channels [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  We haven't seen the news value in them [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=11.3s)]
*  But there is a bit of news to emerge from that story and we want to get to it now [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=13.3s)]
*  So the New York Times has written hundreds and hundreds of articles about January 6th since it happened describing it as a riot and insurrection [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=18.28s)]
*  Insurrection as part of its coverage last summer the Times published a video documentary [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=25.5s)]
*  In which the Times reported that one man was actually caught on camera planning an insurrection [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=30.62s)]
*  Encouraging a breach of the Capitol complex that man's name is Ray Epps [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=36.06s)]
*  Now the New York Times noted that Epps was videotaped on both January 5th and January 6th urging protesters to storm the Capitol here it is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  Tomorrow we need to go into the Capitol [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=56.14s)]
*  Now in a lot of ways that's the strangest video to emerge from January 6th [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=59.94s)]
*  We played it several times in this show quote we need to go into the Capitol into the Capitol [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=66.94s)]
*  Ray Epps tells the crowd [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  The Capitol is a place where people are going to be able to go to the Capitol and to the Capitol [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  And to the Capitol is a place where people are going to be able to go to the Capitol and to the Capitol [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  So shortly after that video surfaced the FBI placed Ray Epps on a list of people wanted for questioning [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=85.14s)]
*  And they released it to the public and you can understand why they did that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=91.14s)]
*  According to the Justice Department what Ray Epps did on that video is a federal crime [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=93.14s)]
*  In fact the Biden administration is charged with a crime of the same name [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=97.14s)]
*  And the FBI is charged with a crime of the same name [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=101.14000000000001s)]
*  And the FBI is charged with a crime of the same name [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=105.14000000000001s)]
*  So according to the Justice Department what Ray Epps did on that video is a federal crime [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=109.74s)]
*  In fact the Biden administration has charged several people with seditious conspiracy [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=113.74s)]
*  For doing precisely what you just saw Ray Epps do urging others to enter the Capitol complex on January 6th [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=117.74s)]
*  Here for example is a quote from a DOJ press release [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=123.74s)]
*  It describes the federal case against five members of the so-called Proud Boys [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  The group you're supposed to be terrified of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=129.74s)]
*  On January 6th, 2021 the defendants directed, mobilized, and led members of the crowd [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=132.34s)]
*  Onto the Capitol grounds and into the Capitol [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=138.34s)]
*  End quote [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=140.34s)]
*  Again that's what you just saw Ray Epps try to do [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=142.34s)]
*  But here's the difference [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=146.34s)]
*  Others who have done that are in prison or facing long terms in prison [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=148.34s)]
*  But no charges have ever been filed against Ray Epps [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=151.34s)]
*  Despite the fact there's no questioning it because once more it's on tape [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=154.34s)]
*  That's very strange [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=158.34s)]
*  And we don't care how many people call his name for pointing that out [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=160.94s)]
*  It is strange [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=162.94s)]
*  And we'd like an answer to what the heck is going on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=164.94s)]
*  Now we've asked Ray Epps on this show repeatedly to explain why he thinks he has escaped prosecution [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=166.94s)]
*  And we'll ask him once again tonight and we will keep asking [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=172.94s)]
*  Because we think it is a very obvious and important question that gets to the heart of what is this exactly [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=174.94s)]
*  But it's amazing how little Democrats want to hear about this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=180.94s)]
*  Again, Nancy Pelosi and Liz Cheney have spent the last year staging an investigation at great expense [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=186.54s)]
*  And then a series of public show trials arresting people in their homes [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=190.54s)]
*  Supposedly designed to discover how and why January 6th happened [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=194.54s)]
*  But they remain curiously uninterested in the Epps case [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=198.54s)]
*  We've got what seems like an actual insurrectionist on tape [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=202.54s)]
*  But they don't want to talk about it [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=206.54s)]
*  And they definitely don't want you to talk about it or ask any questions [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=208.54s)]
*  As if to prove that point, the New York Times just ran a piece explaining that when you ask questions about Ray Epps [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=213.14s)]
*  You are committing a moral crime, maybe even helping Putin [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=219.14s)]
*  The piece was entitled, It's Just Been Hell, Life as the Victim of a January 6th Conspiracy Theory [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=221.14s)]
*  Oh, so Ray Epps, the guy telling people to breach the Capitol, is now in the words of the New York Times, a victim [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=229.14s)]
*  A victim of your unrestrained curiosity [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=235.14s)]
*  Now this piece was written by a reporter who has spent years shilling openly for the intelligence agency [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  It may give you some sense of where this storyline comes from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  Like the agencies themselves, the New York Times piece was highly deceptive [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  For example, the New York Times says that Epps was, quote, taped urging people to go to the Capitol [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  Oh, but that's not what the tape shows [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=257.74s)]
*  Ray Epps was doing something very different [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=259.74s)]
*  Ray Epps was urging people to go into the Capitol, not to the Capitol [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=261.74s)]
*  And there's a big difference, legally [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=265.74s)]
*  One is a crime, according to the DOJ, and the other is not a crime [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's not all Ray Epps did [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  Epps also told people what they should do once they got inside the Capitol [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's on video, too [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  This is just minutes before the first breach of the building that day, watch [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  When do we go in and leave this here? What does that mean? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, for some reason, the New York Times reporter didn't ask Ray Epps what he meant by that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=294.94s)]
*  Now the reporter spent a day talking to Epps [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=298.94s)]
*  It was a day-long conversation, according to the story [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=302.94s)]
*  But that question never came up [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=304.94s)]
*  No meaningful question came up [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=306.94s)]
*  It's all very strange [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=308.94s)]
*  The New York Times is mounting a propaganda campaign on behalf of a self-described Trump voter insurrectionist [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=310.94s)]
*  Now this is the same paper that cheered Ashley Babbitt's death [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=318.94s)]
*  But this same paper is weeping for Ray Epps because people have been mean to him online? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=323.54s)]
*  Hmm, it's almost like they're trying to cover something up [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=327.54s)]
*  Now, buried near the end of the New York Times piece, there's a hint [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=331.54s)]
*  We find this line [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=334.54s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=336.54s)]
*  I don't think so [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=338.54s)]
*  I don't think so [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=340.54s)]
*  I don't think so [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=342.54s)]
*  I don't think so [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=344.54s)]
*  I don't think so [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=346.54s)]
*  I don't think so [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=348.54s)]
*  I don't think so [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=350.54s)]
*  What was in that text? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=353.14000000000004s)]
*  We'd never heard of that before [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=355.14000000000004s)]
*  And it kind of makes you think the entire New York Times piece was written to drop that little bomblet at the end in the least damaging way [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=357.14000000000004s)]
*  We'd never seen that text message before [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=365.14000000000004s)]
*  What exactly did Ray Epps say to his nephew? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=367.14000000000004s)]
*  Have prosecutors reviewed that text? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=369.14000000000004s)]
*  The New York Times doesn't tell us [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=371.14000000000004s)]
*  Nor does the New York Times tell us whether Ray Epps has had any contact with any federal agencies in the period before January 6 [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  That's the core question [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=380.14000000000004s)]
*  But they didn't ask it [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=382.14s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=383.74s)]
*  Seems like a major omission [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=385.74s)]
*  But don't ask more questions, commands the New York Times [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=387.74s)]
*  Otherwise, Ray Epps may be killed by Mexican drug cartels [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=389.74s)]
*  Mexican drug cartels? What do they have to do with this? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=393.74s)]
*  We're not sure [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=395.74s)]
*  But according to the paper, there are people who have heard [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=397.74s)]
*  Some cartel members talking about killing Mr. Epps [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=399.74s)]
*  Right, because the drug cartels are committed Trump voters [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=403.74s)]
*  And they feel betrayed by Ray Epps [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=407.74s)]
*  Maybe they're cuing on people too [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=409.74s)]
*  This is highly strange [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=411.74s)]
*  And if you're going to spend more than a year looking into January 6 and you ignore this [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=413.74s)]
*  Then it's more than strange [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=419.74s)]
*  It's an indictment of your motives [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=421.74s)]
*  Darren Beatty is one of the reasons this piece was first written [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=423.74s)]
*  He's the editor of Revolver News [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=427.74s)]
*  Which published the first stories about Ray Epps [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=429.74s)]
*  Obviously the New York Times is very worried about his reporting [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=431.74s)]
*  We're happy to have him join us tonight [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=433.74s)]
*  Darren, thanks so much for coming on [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=435.74s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=437.74s)]
*  Well, it's pretty remarkable [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=439.74s)]
*  I mean, let's take all of this in [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=441.74s)]
*  The one person caught repeatedly urging people into the Capitol as early as January 5 [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=443.74s)]
*  Is the one person of all of the January 6 riot participants [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=449.74s)]
*  That the New York Times just happens to write this ultra sympathetic puff piece for [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=455.74s)]
*  It's quite remarkable [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=461.74s)]
*  And to look at the piece itself [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=463.74s)]
*  As you suggested in your intro [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=465.74s)]
*  There are some real glaring omissions from a journalistic standpoint to have access to this guy [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=471.74s)]
*  Number one, in the entire piece [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=477.74s)]
*  There is no blanket explicit denial on part of Epps [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=481.74s)]
*  To have been associated with any intelligence group [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=485.74s)]
*  DHS, JTTF, military intelligence, so forth [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=489.74s)]
*  Just reiterates his very legal denial of being involved with law enforcement [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=493.74s)]
*  Number two, the piece describes Epps as a Trump supporter [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=499.74s)]
*  He just went to DC to defend Trump and to attend the speech on the last minute thing with his son [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=503.74s)]
*  To attend Trump's speech on election fraud [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=511.74s)]
*  The only thing is, Epps didn't attend the speech [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=513.74s)]
*  Epps travels all the way from Arizona to DC [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=517.74s)]
*  He's a big Trump supporter and he doesn't even attend the speech [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=521.74s)]
*  Instead, he fixates on this bizarre mission to get everyone to go into the Capitol [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=525.74s)]
*  And by the way, he just happens to be hanging out right by the initial breach point [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=531.74s)]
*  Near the peace monument on the west side of the Capitol before the Proud Boys even get there [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=537.74s)]
*  And thirdly, where did Ray Epps get this idea? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=543.74s)]
*  This whole piece doesn't explore that question at all [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=547.74s)]
*  Here is the one person calling for everyone to go in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=550.74s)]
*  Where did you get that idea, Ray Epps? Did it occur to you out of nowhere? Did someone tell you to do it? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=554.74s)]
*  This piece, shockingly, does not explore that question at all [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=559.74s)]
*  Which is the paramount question that's really the animating, the alleged animating focus of January 6th Committee [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=564.74s)]
*  So this is so dirty, Ray Epps' behavior was so egregious that he was one of the first 20 on the FBI Most Wanted list [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=571.74s)]
*  He was featured as a star in the New York Times' own documentary on January 6th [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=578.74s)]
*  And now he's unarrested, unindicted, and he's the only January 6th writer about whom Adam Kinsinger has nice things to say [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=584.74s)]
*  And the New York Times is writing puff pieces about [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=594.74s)]
*  He's the smoking gun of the entire fedsurrection [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=597.74s)]
*  Well, and they go crazy when you ask simple questions [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=600.74s)]
*  Like, what was the role of federal law enforcement or the military in this day? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=604.74s)]
*  And it's been our experience that when they won't answer a question and call you names for asking it, maybe there's something there [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=608.74s)]
*  I appreciate you're pulling this thread relentlessly [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=615.74s)]
*  Darren Beatty, thank you [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylYF6-sZkgM&t=617.74s)]
