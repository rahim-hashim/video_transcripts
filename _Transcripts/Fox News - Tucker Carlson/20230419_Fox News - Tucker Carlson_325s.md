# Robert F. Kennedy Jr tells Tucker this is turning America into a system of socialism for the rich
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk)
*  And we are honored to have him on our show tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=1.92s)]
*  Bobby, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=2.96s)]
*  So you are, of course, being dismissed as a vaccine nut. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=5.8s)]
*  But watching your announcement today, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=9.64s)]
*  it wasn't about pharma even so much [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=12.92s)]
*  as it was about America's place in the world [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=15.64s)]
*  and what do we do about it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=17.44s)]
*  If you wouldn't mind summarizing for our viewers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=18.88s)]
*  where you think we are and what you think we ought to do. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=21.44s)]
*  Well, I gave a long speech, Tucker. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=26.84s)]
*  Thank you again for having me on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=29.04s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=32.48s)]
*  And for that very kind of an introduction. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=33.32s)]
*  You know, I think that the general theme of my speech [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  was this corrupt merger of state and corporate power, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=38.56s)]
*  which has got, which is turning our country [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=42.36s)]
*  into corporate kleptocracy, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  into a system of socialism for the rich [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and this kind of cushy socialism for the rich [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=50.92s)]
*  and this kind of brutal merciless capitalism for the poor. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=54.0s)]
*  It keeps us in a state of war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=60.0s)]
*  It bails out banks at the same time that it, you know, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=62.0s)]
*  this month, last month, the United States government [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=65.12s)]
*  told 30 million people it was cutting their welfare, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=69.64s)]
*  their food stamp checks by 90%. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=72.8s)]
*  It took 15 million people off of Medicare. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=76.16s)]
*  The same month it gave $300 million [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=79.92s)]
*  to the Silicon Valley Bank [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=82.52s)]
*  and tapped up the cost of the Ukraine war to $113 billion. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=85.16s)]
*  We're sending $113 billion to the Ukraine. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=91.16s)]
*  The entire budget of EPA is $12 billion. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  The budget of CDC is $11 billion. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=98.36s)]
*  We have 57% of American citizens [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=101.32s)]
*  could not put their hands on $1,000 if they have an emergency. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=104.36s)]
*  A quarter of our citizens are hungry. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=108.72s)]
*  So we're cutting welfare and food stamps by 90% [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=111.36s)]
*  and we're paying and we're bailing out the bankers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=115.6s)]
*  We're paying for a war that, you know, we can't afford. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=118.6s)]
*  And the way that we do this is by printing money. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  We've printed 10 centuries of money in the last 14 years [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=127.6s)]
*  and that is, that caused the inflation [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=133.44s)]
*  which raises food, which is a tax on the poor. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=136.2s)]
*  Oh, you know, we've raised food prices for basic foods [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=140.92s)]
*  like chicken, dairy, and milk by 76% in the last two years [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=144.44s)]
*  and now we're cutting people's food stamps [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=149.88s)]
*  and bailing out banks the same month. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=151.48s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=154.96s)]
*  And we need to get rid of this kind of corporate control [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=156.68s)]
*  of our government. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=159.64s)]
*  It comes from this, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=160.48s)]
*  our democracy is devolving [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=164.44s)]
*  into kind of a corporate plutocracy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=166.64s)]
*  I would think that what you just said, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=170.24s)]
*  and I'll just be honest, I agree with most of it, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=172.4s)]
*  but even if I didn't, I would think, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=175.12s)]
*  boy, that's a really interesting thing to say. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=176.72s)]
*  You have a coherent worldview. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=178.96s)]
*  You've written a lot of books on these topics. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=180.64s)]
*  You've clearly thought about it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=182.72s)]
*  You're not in it for the money. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=183.56s)]
*  So don't these issues deserve a wide hearing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=185.12s)]
*  before the public entering a presidential year? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=189.8s)]
*  It seems to me that they do. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=192.24s)]
*  I would think they would, and particularly the issues of war [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=196.56s)]
*  and, you know, my son went over and fought in the Ukraine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  As I said today, I think we're, you know, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=202.4s)]
*  people, the major doyens, sort of diplomatic, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  the most respected diplomatic gurus like Henry Kissinger [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  and Jack Matlock and Larry Wilkinson [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=212.8s)]
*  have all said that Ukraine war is a huge problem [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=216.0s)]
*  for our country because it, from a geopolitical standpoint, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=218.68s)]
*  is driving the Russians close to the Chinese, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=222.68s)]
*  which is the worst thing for us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  But we're there for the right reasons [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=227.24s)]
*  because we have tremendous compassion for the Ukrainian people [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=228.88s)]
*  and the illegal invasion, the brutality, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  and also their valor and their courage. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=234.2s)]
*  My own son was serving over there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=237.0s)]
*  He joined a special forces unit as a machine gunner. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=240.12s)]
*  He fought in the Kharkiv Offensive. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=242.92s)]
*  Americans care about the underdog. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=245.4s)]
*  They care about that kind of suffering. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  But the question is, why are we in the Ukraine? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=250.0s)]
*  Because Lloyd Austin, the Secretary of Defense, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=252.48s)]
*  said that we're there to exhaust the Russians. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=255.72s)]
*  President Biden has said that we're there to deplatform, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=258.2s)]
*  to depose Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=262.24s)]
*  And if that's why we're there and we're killing a lot of Ukrainians [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=264.76s)]
*  as pawns in a proxy war between two great powers, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=268.84s)]
*  here's one last thing I would say. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=274.44s)]
*  Nobody talks about this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  There's 14,000 Ukrainian civilians who have died, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=278.44s)]
*  but 300,000 troops. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=281.68s)]
*  Russians are killing Ukrainians at a 7 to 1 to 8 to 1 ratio. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  They cannot sustain this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=289.44s)]
*  What we're being told about this war is just not true. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=290.8s)]
*  No, it's not true. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=294.92s)]
*  And I would hope, despite the fact you criticized their advertisers, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  other media outlets would have enough respect for our country [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=299.32s)]
*  and for its voters to give what you said a hearing, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=302.16s)]
*  because I think it's really important. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=304.72s)]
*  And we're, again, grateful that you came on our show tonight. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=306.0s)]
*  You're always welcome. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=308.36s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy, Jr., thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=309.48s)]
*  Thank you very much, Tucker. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68MhtliIAvk&t=310.96s)]
