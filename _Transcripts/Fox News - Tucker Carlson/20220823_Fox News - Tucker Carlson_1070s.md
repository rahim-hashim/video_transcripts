# Tucker Carlson: This is a clear indication of things unraveling
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, turns out the symptoms of societal decay are universal. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=2.0s)]
*  They're not unique to a specific society. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=6.32s)]
*  You recognize them in any country at any time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=8.24s)]
*  Now or a thousand years ago, always the same. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  The men become weak, the leaders get decadent, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=14.0s)]
*  law enforcement gets politicized, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=16.96s)]
*  the currency gets devalued, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=19.28s)]
*  and then things begin to come apart. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=21.36s)]
*  Pretty soon, doesn't take long, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  the society can no longer perform its most basic function. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=25.76s)]
*  The reason we have societies in the first place, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=29.12s)]
*  which is to protect the weak from the strong. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=31.36s)]
*  That's why you have a society. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=34.24s)]
*  Well, in places like this, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=36.32s)]
*  it becomes among many other things, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=37.84s)]
*  very hard to travel anywhere. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=39.44s)]
*  You just can't go where you want to go. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=41.28s)]
*  With legitimate authority in retreat, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=44.0s)]
*  roads are not controlled by the police. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=46.72s)]
*  They're controlled by armed predators. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=49.28s)]
*  And the armed predators take exactly what they want from travelers [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=51.36s)]
*  because they can. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=54.08s)]
*  This is an ancient problem. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  It used to be called highway robbery. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=56.96s)]
*  And for most of history, it kept people very close to home. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=59.36s)]
*  Turns out it still exists, but now it's called carjacking. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=63.28s)]
*  Carjacking is the clearest possible sign [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=67.52s)]
*  that your civilization is falling apart. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=70.48s)]
*  And that's why you find it in places like Somalia and South Africa, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=72.72s)]
*  places where force, violence, and clan loyalty [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=76.56s)]
*  have replaced law and order, places where might makes right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=80.0s)]
*  In the city of Johannesburg, for example, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  a vehicle is hijacked on average once every hour of the day. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=85.92s)]
*  Now, once that happens, there's really no coming back from it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Nobody's going to build anything in a city with endemic carjacking. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=93.04s)]
*  In fact, most normal people will leave as fast as they can, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=97.6s)]
*  as they have in Johannesburg. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=100.08s)]
*  As they are starting to do, we are sad to tell you, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=102.0s)]
*  in the city of New Orleans, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=104.56s)]
*  where carjacking is now a permanent feature of life. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Last summer, a law student called Madison Bergeron [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=110.16s)]
*  pulled into the driveway of her home in New Orleans [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=112.8s)]
*  as she gathered her belongings in the car. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=115.36s)]
*  A young man appeared out of nowhere, stuck a gun in her face, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=117.12s)]
*  and demanded that she hand over everything she had, including the car. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=120.4s)]
*  He screamed at her, terrified she complied. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=123.84s)]
*  And that's what carjacking is always like. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=126.4s)]
*  It is an act of violence. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=128.0s)]
*  People don't want to give up their cars. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=129.6s)]
*  They have to be terrified into doing so. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  That's why the majority of victims are women, old women, young women. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=134.64s)]
*  And that's why the people who do it will do anything. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=139.6s)]
*  If you will carjack, if you will steal someone's car at gunpoint, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=142.0s)]
*  you will also rape. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=146.16s)]
*  You will also murder. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=147.68s)]
*  You have no limits. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=148.88s)]
*  You are willing to violate on the most basic level [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=150.64s)]
*  the civil rights of another person. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=153.76s)]
*  And in this case, that was certainly true, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=155.84s)]
*  because that same perpetrator went on, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=157.84s)]
*  after terrifying Madison Bergeron and stealing her car, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=160.16s)]
*  to do the same to other women in the city, a lot of them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=163.2s)]
*  There was a car blocking me in, one victim recalled. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=167.12s)]
*  And next thing I turn in there is yelling, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  and there's a gun barrel in my face. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=171.52s)]
*  The kid is yelling to get the F out of the car, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=173.36s)]
*  get the F out of the car or else he will shoot me. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  In all, the carjacker would terrorize five women [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  and steal five cars in just two days [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  before New Orleans police finally arrested him. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=185.28s)]
*  And it's amazing that they did, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=187.36s)]
*  because there are virtually no police left in New Orleans. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  In a city that probably needs about 2000 cops, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=191.36s)]
*  there are under 500 active duty policemen left in New Orleans. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=194.4s)]
*  In New Orleans, they have definitely defunded the police. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=199.44s)]
*  But in this case, the carjacker, a young teenager, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=203.04s)]
*  was ultimately caught, tried, convicted, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=205.68s)]
*  and sentenced for his crimes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=210.24s)]
*  Now these crimes got a lot of attention in New Orleans. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=212.0s)]
*  So the mayor of the city, Lotoya Cantrell, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=214.56s)]
*  showed up to the sentencing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=216.88s)]
*  But here's the twist in the story. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=218.24s)]
*  Mayor Cantrell didn't show up to support the victims, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=220.32s)]
*  the women who'd been terrorized by this predator, no. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=222.8s)]
*  The mayor showed up to support the carjacker [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=227.12s)]
*  and to let the entire city know that she was doing it, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=230.0s)]
*  to let everyone know whose side she was on. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=232.56s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=235.52s)]
*  The mayor showed up in court as a character witness [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  for a 14-year-old defender during sentencing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  The teen robbed three women in separate incidents [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  with a fake gun, stealing their cars and belongings. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  The victims told Fox 8 they were traumatized by what happened. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=249.12s)]
*  And then they felt victimized all over again [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=253.2s)]
*  when the mayor showed up in support of the young criminal. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=256.32s)]
*  I was in shock. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  She wasn't there for us. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=260.56s)]
*  She was there for the assaultant and his mother. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=261.84s)]
*  And it felt like she was supporting the crime. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=266.48s)]
*  Juvenile judge, Renard Darensburg, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=268.88s)]
*  sentenced the juvenile to a three-year suspended sentence, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=270.88s)]
*  meaning no jail time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  It felt like she was supporting the crime, said the victim. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=278.08s)]
*  Well, yes, it did, because that's exactly what the mayor was doing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=281.52s)]
*  Cantrell was taking the side of the carjacker [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=286.24s)]
*  over the traumatized, law-abiding woman. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=289.44s)]
*  Now, in New Orleans, Cantrell is known by her nickname, T.D. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  But many people call her exactly what she is, Latoya the Destroyer. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=296.96s)]
*  She is, in fact, a destroyer. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=302.0s)]
*  The mayor is incompetent. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=303.2s)]
*  The mayor is an open race hater. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=304.4s)]
*  The mayor is an encourager of violence. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=306.32s)]
*  And she is destroying an already wounded city. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  We reached out to Mayor Cantrell's office [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  to ask why she's doing all of this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  Why did she pressure a judge to release a convicted armed carjacker [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=315.52s)]
*  with no prison time? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=319.52s)]
*  But of course, she didn't reply to us. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=320.56s)]
*  It turns out the mayor of New Orleans had a connection to this carjacker. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=322.64s)]
*  Cantrell had enrolled this person in one of her administration's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=326.32s)]
*  welfare programs called Pathways Youth Internship Program. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  Using taxpayer money, the program says it provides young people [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=333.44s)]
*  who commit crimes with a reward, paid internships and a stipend. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=336.32s)]
*  We contacted the Pathways program this morning. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  We wanted to know how many people enrolled in that program [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  go on to commit violent crime within five years. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=345.76s)]
*  We also asked how much taxpayer money they spend. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=348.24s)]
*  But of course, they didn't answer. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=350.8s)]
*  But we don't need an answer. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=352.8s)]
*  We know exactly what this is. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=354.32s)]
*  Pathways, like most social justice scams, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=356.64s)]
*  is not in fact designed to reduce crime. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=358.8s)]
*  It's about siding with the criminal, giving the criminals as much support as they need. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=362.64s)]
*  Even a courtroom visit from the mayor, if necessary, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=368.96s)]
*  so they can go out and commit more crimes as soon as possible. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=371.84s)]
*  So why would you do something like this if you were the mayor of a city of New Orleans? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=375.76s)]
*  Why would you force people to leave your city? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=379.2s)]
*  The people who pay all the taxes of all colors, by the way. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=382.32s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, possibly because the people who are left tend to be the ones who vote for you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=387.28s)]
*  So it is a kind of electoral strategy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=394.08s)]
*  It's not just happening in New Orleans. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  It's happening in a lot of places. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  The downside is it leads to carnage. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=398.96s)]
*  There have already been 191 carjackings in the city of New Orleans this year alone. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  Through all of last year, there were a total of 177. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=406.23999999999995s)]
*  Now, most of these carjackings, and this is true in a lot of other places, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=409.84s)]
*  Washington, D.C., we think, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=413.2s)]
*  most of these are committed by people under the age of 18. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  Because they know they'll get off. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  There's no cause. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  The local station WWLTV found that in 2021, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=419.67999999999995s)]
*  juvenile carjacking suspects outnumbered adults by more than two to one. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that these are nerf versions of carjackings. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=428.48s)]
*  They're very violent. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=432.56s)]
*  In fact, they're always violent, and sometimes they're fatal. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=433.76s)]
*  In March, several juveniles aged 15 to 17 mutilated the body of a grandmother, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  an elderly woman, as they carjacked her in mid-city New Orleans. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  They dragged her body down the street. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  Here's Fox 8, New Orleans, reporting on it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=447.44s)]
*  17-year-old John Honore, 16-year-old Bernaya Baker, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=450.72s)]
*  and 15-year-old Markel Curtis and Lenraia Theophile will be tried as adults on second-degree [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=454.72s)]
*  murder charges. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  Police say that the teens carjacked Linda Freaky in mid-city back in March. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=464.16s)]
*  Freaky was beat and then dragged outside of her car until her arm was eventually [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  severed from her body. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=475.44000000000005s)]
*  She then bled to death in the middle of the street. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  So again, society exists not to protect 17-year-olds with guns. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=479.68s)]
*  On the most basic level, those are the strongest people in society, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=486.72s)]
*  people willing to use force to get what they want. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=490.88s)]
*  No, society exists to protect people who need the protection, the helpless, the weak, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=492.8s)]
*  grandmothers who might be dragged and have their arms ripped off without police protection. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  And of course, in the absence of police protection, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=505.36s)]
*  and in the absence of leadership that cares about the weak, those are exactly the person, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=508.0s)]
*  people who are murdered. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=512.64s)]
*  And it's not just happening in New Orleans. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=513.84s)]
*  What's interesting, if you pull back a little bit, and we have because we think that carjacking [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=516.4s)]
*  is a really clear indication of things unraveling, you find that cities with Soros-backed DAs [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=520.48s)]
*  and well-funded diversion programs for at-risk youth are seeing surges in carjacking. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=526.24s)]
*  Could there be a connection? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=533.2s)]
*  In Philadelphia, for example, consider that city. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=534.64s)]
*  This is reporting from the local station there, Fox 29. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=539.5999999999999s)]
*  Carjackings in Philly, a crime that's been exploding over the last several months. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=544.16s)]
*  And according to Philly police numbers released to Steve Keighley by a source, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=548.4s)]
*  it's getting worse. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=552.7199999999999s)]
*  From January 1st of this year through July 31st, a police source says there have been [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=554.0799999999999s)]
*  757 carjackings citywide. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=558.88s)]
*  There were roughly 850 carjackings in all of 2021. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=562.48s)]
*  The latest sourced police statistics show that the majority of these carjackings, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=567.76s)]
*  more than 500, happened at gunpoint and also happened while the victims were at their parked cars. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=572.96s)]
*  So why is this happening? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=582.08s)]
*  Well, it's happening for very deep reasons. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=583.44s)]
*  Any 15 or 17-year-old who sticks a gun in the face of strangers, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=586.64s)]
*  threatens their lives, or kills them in order to steal a car is the product of something that is [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=590.96s)]
*  very hard to fix, disintegrating families. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  That's the real reason. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=598.72s)]
*  But society, the authorities, still have an obligation to try and stop it for the sake [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=600.0s)]
*  of the rest of us. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=605.44s)]
*  So what are these cities doing to stop it? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=606.72s)]
*  Well, Philadelphia, like New Orleans, sends so-called at-risk youth to violin lessons [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=608.96s)]
*  through something called the Philadelphia Arts and Education Partnership. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=614.88s)]
*  So the idea is, after a month of violin lessons, these young criminals, people who've been busted [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=618.32s)]
*  committing crimes, get their records expunged. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=625.2s)]
*  That was the plan that Philadelphia's DA put into place last year. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=628.48s)]
*  Has it worked? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=632.88s)]
*  Well, sad to tell you that despite the violin lessons, crime has gone up among young people, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=633.84s)]
*  carjackings in particular. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=639.7600000000001s)]
*  As Philadelphia's police commissioner, Daniel Outlaw, put it, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=641.84s)]
*  I don't want to say it's surprising, but it's definitely concerning, really. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=644.64s)]
*  Well, it's not surprising to us, but it is for sure an understatement. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=650.8s)]
*  From 2020 to 2021, there's been a 108% increase in carjackings in Philadelphia. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=654.4799999999999s)]
*  Chicago, too, putting up similar numbers. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=661.92s)]
*  Chicago has had more than 1,000 carjackings this year alone. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=663.92s)]
*  What does that do to a city? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=668.4799999999999s)]
*  1,000 carjackings? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=669.76s)]
*  For every carjacking, there is a much larger group of people now afraid to drive. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=671.92s)]
*  Now, Chicago is the place where Soros-backed DA, Kim Fox, recently implemented something called [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  the Juvenile Intervention and Support Center. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=684.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=688.24s)]
*  For this initiative, Fox partnered with a more quoting black-owned, black-run businesses called [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=689.04s)]
*  Chi by Design, which pledges to quote, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=694.72s)]
*  be bold in our collaborative approach to create anti-racist outcomes. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=696.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  So it's been completely politicized. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=702.0s)]
*  The point of law enforcement traditionally has been to enforce the law, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=704.88s)]
*  laws that are passed by legislatures as a product of the democratic process [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  in order to protect everybody else. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=714.0s)]
*  Now the point of law enforcement is to affect anti-racist outcomes, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=717.28s)]
*  in other words, political outcomes. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=721.28s)]
*  How's that working in Chicago? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=724.16s)]
*  Well, here's Fox 32 Chicago to tell you. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=725.92s)]
*  There's our carjack car. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=728.4s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=729.52s)]
*  Chicago's got it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=730.24s)]
*  We got eyes on it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=731.36s)]
*  One of the passengers in the stolen SUV eventually fled. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=732.32s)]
*  When police caught him, they discovered he was 17 years old, released to his mother. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=736.32s)]
*  Sadly, he's not the youngest suspect that members of the carjacking task force have seen. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=744.88s)]
*  A well-known 11-year-old. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=750.48s)]
*  That have been in contact with police before? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=753.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=755.36s)]
*  An 11-year-old was arrested in Chicago as part of a carjacking crew, and it was not his first time. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=756.48s)]
*  11 years old. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=764.0s)]
*  One of that carjackers' victims said that, quote, he actually skipped like a child all the way up to the car he stole. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  We can't tell you his name because he's an at-risk youth, apparently needs more violin lessons, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=771.92s)]
*  and he will soon be a productive member of society. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a joke. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=781.28s)]
*  This is a joke. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=782.7199999999999s)]
*  The people administering the program know it's a joke. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=783.76s)]
*  It doesn't achieve the main overriding goal, which is to protect people who just want to go to the grocery store, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=787.1199999999999s)]
*  to protect grandmothers who want to go to church, protect everybody else who wants to go to work in the morning, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=793.28s)]

*  Chicago's leaders don't care. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=803.1199999999999s)]
*  The same is true, by the way, of the unnamed 16-year-old girl who hijacked a man's Audi while his child was in the car. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  That's an atrocity. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=810.7199999999999s)]
*  Here's Fox's 32 in Chicago. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=813.1999999999999s)]
*  The frantic father reports his car stolen. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=820.4s)]
*  So as you so often see in these cases, the person who commits the crime has committed a ton of other [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=830.56s)]
*  crime because it turns out most crimes are committed by a very small number of people. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=835.92s)]
*  And in this case, the girl who stole that car stole several other cars that month, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=840.16s)]
*  which makes you wonder maybe violin lessons and visits in the courtroom from the mayor [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=845.76s)]
*  don't really work. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=851.4399999999999s)]
*  Maybe these people need a father at home. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=852.8s)]
*  The nuclear family? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=854.8s)]
*  Right. Those things are not in fact racist. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=858.64s)]
*  They are essential to any functioning civilization. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  And in lieu of them, it is clear that things fall apart. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=865.5200000000001s)]
*  And the only thing you can do is to put people out of the public sphere away [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=871.84s)]
*  so that other people aren't hurt by them. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=879.12s)]
*  That's the best we can do. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=881.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's obligatory that we do it because people are being killed. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=882.96s)]
*  If you don't do that, you wind up in a society in which 11-year-olds treat carjacking like a sport [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=888.0s)]
*  because they know they can get out of jail very quickly. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=892.6400000000001s)]
*  Here's Fox 2 in Detroit. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=895.04s)]
*  Detroit police arrested an 11-, 12- and 14-year-old for stealing high-end hellcats [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=897.76s)]
*  off the Jefferson North lots. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=904.24s)]
*  They think it's fun. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=906.56s)]
*  You know, they think it's fun and there's no penalty to it. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  Head of the Detroit Police Commercial Auto Theft Unit, Lieutenant Clive Stewart [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=910.7199999999999s)]
*  stunned over the trio of kids arrested Monday right here on the storage lot of the Jefferson [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=915.36s)]
*  North plant. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=920.96s)]
*  In a separate incident, this kid, just 14 years old, an alleged repeat carjacker, arrested this [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=921.9200000000001s)]
*  weekend. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=928.24s)]
*  He was out on bond from a carjacking in May. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  Then last week, police say he jacked two cars on the city's east side the same night. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=931.6s)]
*  So if you look closely enough at this specific problem, carjacking, and it's one of many problems [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=938.08s)]
*  in our society that seem to be getting worse, but just look at this one. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=944.0s)]
*  And you begin to realize, because everything is irony at this point, the youth violence [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=947.84s)]
*  prevention initiatives that are supposed to stop this actually enable it, indeed appear to be [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  encouraging it, and yet they're still getting millions of dollars from the Biden administration. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=960.32s)]
*  The youth diversion programs that make these kinds of crimes more common have a lot in common with [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=964.72s)]
*  the equity programs for unhoused people that seem to encourage homelessness. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=970.88s)]
*  Those two have led to more carjackings. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=977.12s)]
*  Here's a report from Fox 11 in LA. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=979.44s)]
*  Carjacking caught on camera. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=984.8000000000001s)]
*  Witnesses keeping their distance as a homeless man punches a street vendor, then steals his van. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=986.88s)]
*  The street vendor was carjacked by a homeless man over the weekend. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=993.2s)]
*  Esteban says he'd even seen his attacker before and that he had never had a problem with him, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=999.84s)]
*  adding that he gave the man food shortly before he punched him in the face. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1004.8s)]
*  Yeah, so if they're happening in New Orleans and Los Angeles and Chicago, of course, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1011.52s)]
*  this is happening in our biggest city, New York, which is also run by yet another Soros DA. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1019.04s)]
*  But as evidence of the collapse of social order is in Philadelphia, Detroit, LA, and Las Vegas, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1026.48s)]
*  nowhere in the country is experiencing a bigger increase in carjackings than the birthplace of our [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1031.12s)]
*  new civil rights movement, Minneapolis, where this all started. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  According to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, Minneapolis saw the largest percent increase in [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1041.28s)]
*  carjackings in the country from 2019 to 2021, a 339% jump. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1045.76s)]
*  What the hell is going on and why is no one saying anything about it and why are these [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1052.8s)]
*  cities doing nothing to stop it? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8p0-0kvOW4&t=1057.12s)]
