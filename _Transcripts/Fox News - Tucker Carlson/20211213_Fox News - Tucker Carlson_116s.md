# Tucker: We need to stop using this term
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 13, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM)
*  So here's a fact worth remembering. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=0.0s)]
*  If you want to think clearly, if you want to make wise decisions, you have to use clear [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=2.12s)]
*  and precise language. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=6.08s)]
*  Here's another fact. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  If by contrast you want to brainwash and control an entire population, then the first thing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=8.9s)]
*  you do is ban clear language and substitute it with propaganda, that is nonsensical chunks [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=13.48s)]
*  of words glued together for political effect. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=19.5s)]
*  In two sentences, that's our entire current political landscape. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=23.0s)]
*  The left understands it, the right does not. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=26.28s)]
*  Consider the term people of color. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=29.22s)]
*  Now that's a phrase that would have seemed mildly offensive 20 years ago, kind of an [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=30.98s)]
*  ugly term. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=34.42s)]
*  And yet now it's mandatory at every level of our society. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=35.86s)]
*  The question is, what does it mean exactly? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=38.86s)]
*  What is a person of color? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=40.78s)]
*  Well, it's anyone who isn't white, which is to say it's the overwhelming majority of the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=42.26s)]
*  world's population. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=46.54s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself, how exactly is this a meaningful category? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=48.5s)]
*  What does a Polynesian tuna fisherman have in common with a Bolivian coca farmer or a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  foundry worker in central China, or for that matter, with Kamala Harris? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=57.26s)]
*  Well not really anything, except that they're not white. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=61.78s)]
*  That's a pretty ominous way to define a huge group of people if you think about it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=65.34s)]
*  In fact, it's a racist way to define a huge group of people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=69.02s)]
*  Everyone who's white is not the same, and only an entitled white liberal could believe [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=73.7s)]
*  otherwise. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=78.06s)]
*  No normal person could ever think that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=79.06s)]
*  So let's stop using the phrase. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=81.34s)]
*  Let's not participate. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=82.86s)]
*  Don't use the term people of color. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=84.58s)]
*  This is the crudest kind of propaganda designed to divide the country by race. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=86.06s)]
*  So don't say it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=91.34s)]
*  What do you replace it with? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=92.34s)]
*  If you're white, what do you call people who don't look like you? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=93.9s)]
*  Well, if they're citizens of this country, maybe you call them Americans, because that's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=96.58s)]
*  what they actually are. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpkIn0jjeMM&t=101.62s)]
