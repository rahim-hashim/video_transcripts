# Tucker Carlson remembers the life of P.J. O’Rourke
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY)
*  They always tell you never to meet your heroes because it's so disappointing and that's usually true, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=0.0s)]
*  but 32 years ago last month I met PJ O'Rourke in a bar in Managua, Nicaragua. He was a hero of mine [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=4.08s)]
*  and he turned out to be every bit the man I hoped he would be and for 30 years we were friends. PJ [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  O'Rourke, a lot to say about him, just two things. One of the funniest people who ever wrote in English [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=17.44s)]
*  at a time when you're allowed to be funny, which is to say totally free and honest, his 1987 book [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=22.8s)]
*  Republican Party Reptiles, still worth reading, his work for Rolling Stone in the 70s, in the 80s, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=27.6s)]
*  nationally in Pune in the 70s, remarkable. But he was also one of the very few people in journalism [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=32.56s)]
*  who actually had a happy life, who cared about the right things. He loved his wife, his children, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  northern New England, his spaniels, bird hunting, having lunch with his friends, tobacco. He was a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=44.24s)]
*  man in full, a great man, and it's with deep sadness we tell you that he passed away today at 74. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0TrPE6KoLY&t=51.36s)]
