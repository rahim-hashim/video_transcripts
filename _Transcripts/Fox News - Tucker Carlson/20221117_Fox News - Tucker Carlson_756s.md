# Tucker Carlson: This lie could get millions of Americans killed
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA)
*  Evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, the frustrating thing about the news media, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=1.74s)]
*  no matter how horrible they are, is that you need them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=4.32s)]
*  You can't understand the world, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=7.0s)]
*  except through the news media. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=10.24s)]
*  That's where all of our information comes from. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=11.9s)]
*  Can't really change that at this point, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  but we can go into it with open eyes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=16.46s)]
*  And so you should know that the thing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=19.2s)]
*  about reading the news is even when it's not [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=21.18s)]
*  intentionally dishonest, and often now it is, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=24.94s)]
*  no matter what the intent of it, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=27.82s)]
*  the first draft of the story that you read is always wrong. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=29.22s)]
*  Not sometimes wrong, always wrong. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=33.0s)]
*  Occasionally in small ways, sometimes in big [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  and utterly distorting ways. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=39.54s)]
*  Dewey defeats Truman, Iraq has nukes, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=41.18s)]
*  Russia bombed its own pipeline. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=43.58s)]
*  Stories like this are laughably untrue. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=46.18s)]
*  They are an inversion of the truth, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=48.82s)]
*  which inevitably emerges later. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  And at times it's unintentional, they just made a mistake, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  they got it wrong. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=53.94s)]
*  But more often on the big stories, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=55.2s)]
*  the ones that change policy, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=57.16s)]
*  they are lying on purpose. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=58.74s)]
*  So how do you know whether they're lying on purpose [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=60.74s)]
*  or whether they just got it wrong by accident? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  Well, when the story trends on social media, you know. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=65.5s)]
*  That means that somewhere there's a tech executive [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=68.5s)]
*  who's decided to crank up the propaganda dial [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=70.78s)]
*  in order to manipulate you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=72.76s)]
*  It's really not so different from what [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=74.66s)]
*  the North Korean state news agency does. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=75.68s)]
*  When there's a famine, they start promoting stories [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=77.62s)]
*  about record rice harvests, so you wouldn't notice. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=79.18s)]
*  So with that in mind, it would have been worth pausing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=82.34s)]
*  for a moment in skepticism when you saw that phone, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  that story on your phone yesterday, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  about how Russia had bombed Poland. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=89.54s)]
*  Poland is a member of NATO, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=91.94s)]
*  the North American Treaty Organization, so are we. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=93.62s)]
*  That means if Russia were to attack NATO, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=96.28s)]
*  then we could very easily be obligated to attack Russia back. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=98.78s)]
*  Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=102.5s)]
*  so that would be inevitably, by definition, World War III, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  hundreds of people might die. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=107.9s)]
*  So this was not a small story. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=109.78s)]
*  It was Archduke Ferdinand and Sarajevo stuff. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=112.02000000000001s)]
*  This story came, as it so often does, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  from the Associated Press, citing, again, as usual, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=117.66s)]
*  a quote, unnamed senior US intel official. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=121.3s)]
*  So according to this unnamed intel official, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=124.58s)]
*  Russia had launched an entirely unprovoked [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=127.58s)]
*  first strike against Poland. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=130.54s)]
*  The Russian military had lobbed missiles [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=132.7s)]
*  into Polish territory, thereby killing two Poles at a farm. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=134.34s)]
*  So by definition, it was time for Europe and the US [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=139.06s)]
*  to invoke Article V, the collective defense principle, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=141.64s)]
*  and begin a total war on Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=143.98s)]
*  President Zelensky of Ukraine agreed with this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=147.22s)]
*  The US must declare war on Russia in the wake of this story. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  Watch his reaction. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  What we warned about a long time ago happened today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=155.74s)]
*  We've been saying this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=158.62s)]
*  Terror is not limited to our national borders. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=160.22s)]
*  It's already spread to the territory of Moldova, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=163.06s)]
*  and today, Russian missiles hit Poland, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  the territory of a friendly country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=168.7s)]
*  To fire missiles at NATO territory, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=171.1s)]
*  this is a Russian missile attack on collective security. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  This is a very significant escalation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=176.66s)]
*  We must act. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  This is a Russian missile attack on collective security. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=181.42s)]
*  In other words, not simply on Poland or on Ukraine, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=184.42s)]
*  but on the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  This is an attack on the US by Russia, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  and quote, we must act. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  So this is a man with some moral authority. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  This is the only head of state in the world [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  to receive a Vogue photo spread this year. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=194.77999999999997s)]
*  This is a personal friend of Sean Penn and Ben Stillers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=197.06s)]
*  And here he was commanding the US [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=200.1s)]
*  to lead the Third World War immediately. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=202.06s)]
*  So as we said, this was not a minor AP story. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  The only problem was it was completely and utterly wrong. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=207.98s)]
*  Zelensky, the unnamed American intel officer, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  and the Associated Press had all been trafficking [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=215.18s)]
*  in dangerous misinformation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=217.8s)]
*  That became clear within a few hours [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=220.54s)]
*  when pictures of the exploded missile [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=221.82s)]
*  surfaced on social media. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=223.3s)]
*  People who know a lot about military hardware [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=224.58s)]
*  started asking questions about this stuff. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=226.18s)]
*  So they looked at a picture of a fragment of the motor [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=228.82s)]
*  from this destroyed missile, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=231.78s)]
*  and they noticed that the ordnance was an S-300 system. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=233.34s)]
*  Now the S-300 system is only being used [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=236.7s)]
*  by the Ukrainian military, not the Russians. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=239.86s)]
*  So it could not have been a Russian military attack. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=241.98s)]
*  Somehow, Ukraine had bombed Poland and killed people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=245.62s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=249.4s)]
*  And within a day, the Pentagon, NATO, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=250.38s)]
*  even the government of Poland, all were forced to admit that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=252.34s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=254.96s)]
*  Ukraine did it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=255.8s)]
*  But here's the interesting thing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=257.58s)]
*  and the thing that is relevant to us. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=258.66s)]
*  Ukraine never admitted that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=260.34s)]
*  Zelensky kept lying on television. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=262.78s)]
*  So when you're in a country where the free press [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=266.0s)]
*  has been banned, as it has been in Ukraine, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=267.5s)]
*  you may not realize that the rest of the world [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=269.94s)]
*  is not required to believe you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=271.41999999999996s)]
*  You can't throw them all in jail. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=272.7s)]
*  So he kept telling you what you knew was not true. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=274.88s)]
*  Quote, I have no doubt that this is not our missile, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=277.78s)]
*  he said today. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  I believe that this was a Russian missile [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=281.7s)]
*  based on military reports. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=283.41999999999996s)]
*  Again, that's not only untrue, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=286.12s)]
*  it's a lie that could get millions of Americans killed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=288.42s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=291.42s)]
*  is it time to stop backing this guy? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=293.38s)]
*  Could the risk be too high? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=295.06s)]
*  He's lying on purpose to get us into a war. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=297.3s)]
*  Maybe he's not worth supporting in the first place. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=300.1s)]
*  Maybe he's just another corrupt [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=302.1s)]
*  Eastern European strongman in a tracksuit [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=303.54s)]
*  getting as rich as he can from American handouts. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  That might be the lesson, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=308.5s)]
*  but that is not at all the lesson [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=310.26s)]
*  that the Biden administration [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  is drawing from what just happened. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=312.86s)]
*  Watch former Raytheon board member Lloyd Austin [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=314.86s)]
*  explain that even if the missile attack was from Ukraine, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=316.98s)]
*  it's still Russia's fault. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  This explosion was most likely [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=322.22s)]
*  the result of a Ukrainian air defense missile [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=324.94s)]
*  that unfortunately landed in Poland. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=327.92s)]
*  And whatever the final conclusions may be, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=331.26s)]
*  the world knows that Russia bears ultimate responsibility [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=334.44s)]
*  for this incident. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  So this is not what we would refer to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=342.70000000000005s)]
*  as evidence-based reasoning. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=344.66s)]
*  What you're hearing from the secretary of defense [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=347.42s)]
*  is that Ukraine lobbed a missile into Poland [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  and killed Poles, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=352.38000000000005s)]
*  but you need to continue to send billions to Ukraine [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  to fight Russia. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=358.02000000000004s)]
*  So now you're starting to see [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=360.42s)]
*  why the unnamed intel official [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=363.06s)]
*  leaked this story to the Associated Press [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=365.5s)]
*  in the first place, this manufactured story. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=367.42s)]
*  And the point of course, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=369.42s)]
*  was to manipulate the United States Congress [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=370.86s)]
*  as so often happened. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=373.32s)]
*  Unnamed American intel official [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=375.4s)]
*  leaked something to the New York Times, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=378.18s)]
*  Washington Post, AP, members of Congress read this [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=379.36s)]
*  and do what the intel agencies [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=382.24s)]
*  and the administration want them to do. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=383.96s)]
*  And we can all but prove that in this case, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=386.8s)]
*  because shortly after this fake news [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=389.1s)]
*  of this fake Russian missile attack appeared on the AP Wire, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=391.12s)]
*  the White House demanded another $37 billion [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=394.24s)]
*  in funding for Ukraine. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=397.68s)]
*  So that raises the question, where does that put us? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=400.0s)]
*  What's the total that we've sent to Ukraine so far? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=402.4s)]
*  Well, in just nine months, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  the Biden administration has committed a total [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  of $91 billion to Ukraine [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=409.32s)]
*  at a time when our borders still open [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  and our economy is degrading fast. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=414.84s)]
*  So how much is that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=416.78s)]
*  Well, as Glenn Greenwald pointed out today, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=418.08s)]
*  $91 billion is twice the average annual US expenditure [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=420.44s)]
*  during our own war in Afghanistan. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=424.67999999999995s)]
*  $91 billion is 33% more [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=426.91999999999996s)]
*  than the entire annual military budget [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=429.44s)]
*  of the entire country of Russia, but it's not enough. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=433.36s)]
*  Today, Mark Milley informed us [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=436.68s)]
*  that $91 billion is just the beginning. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  The United States are determined [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=441.72s)]
*  to continue to support Ukraine [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=444.8s)]
*  with the means to defend themselves for as long as it takes. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  We will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=451.72s)]
*  and we will continue to support them as long as it takes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  And until then, we will continue to support all the way [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=460.76s)]
*  for as long as it takes. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=464.4s)]
*  We will be there for as long as it takes. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=466.08s)]
*  So there you have the obedient little general [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=469.88s)]
*  reading the talking points again, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=471.68s)]
*  but it still doesn't answer the question why. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=472.96s)]
*  As long as it takes, okay, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=476.36s)]
*  some things are worth that commitment, but why this one? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=479.08s)]
*  What is the point of this exactly? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=481.64s)]
*  We can't say we're defending democracy in Ukraine, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=483.12s)]
*  which is not a democratic country. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=485.38s)]
*  We can't explain clearly or even at all [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=487.64000000000004s)]
*  where our national security interest lies [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  in this conflict between two Eastern European countries. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  So why would we bankrupt ourselves to fund it? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=497.72s)]
*  Could it be that this entire effort is a choreographed scam [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=501.08000000000004s)]
*  to enrich the Democratic Party and its allies [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  and achieve left-wing ideological goals [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  that have nothing to do [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=509.68s)]
*  with the core interests of the United States? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=510.76000000000005s)]
*  Could it be this whole thing [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=512.88s)]
*  is BLM Eastern European edition? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=514.32s)]
*  Well, it's possible, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=518.2800000000001s)]
*  because that is how Washington actually works. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  And the brewing FTX scandal kind of exposes that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  You may have read about this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=524.44s)]
*  FTX is the cryptocurrency exchange that just blew up [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=525.2800000000001s)]
*  in one of the single biggest one-day losses [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  in world history, possibly the biggest ever. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=531.72s)]
*  Now, what was FTX? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=534.9200000000001s)]
*  It wasn't a conventional business. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=536.44s)]
*  No, in fact, it was the finance arm of the Democratic Party. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=537.84s)]
*  And the backscratching, the snake eating its tail, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=541.64s)]
*  is on full display in this story. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=544.96s)]
*  So Democrats invited FTX's CEO, Sam Bankmanfried, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=547.84s)]
*  to the White House to discuss crypto regulation. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=550.9200000000001s)]
*  So the people who were supposed to be keeping this business [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  within the lines were actually colluding with the business [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=557.84s)]
*  and doing nothing to keep it from defrauding its investors. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=560.9200000000001s)]
*  And then in Congress was also supposed to be overseeing [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=564.28s)]
*  the finance sector, Maxine Waters, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=567.24s)]
*  who chairs the financial services committee, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=569.52s)]
*  was palling around with Sam Bankmanfried. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  She took the picture with him [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=573.6s)]
*  you're seeing on your screen now. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=574.9200000000001s)]
*  That picture was taken after the first ever hearing [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=576.48s)]
*  on crypto regulations. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=579.08s)]
*  So that's a pretty good deal. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=580.52s)]
*  You're running a scam and the regulators are on your side. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=581.4s)]
*  How do you keep them on your side? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=584.16s)]
*  Well, if you're Sam Bankmanfried, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=585.88s)]
*  you donate nearly $40 billion to Democrats in the midterm, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=587.16s)]
*  which he did. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=590.84s)]
*  And that total puts him number two on the donor list [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=591.84s)]
*  right below George Soros. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=594.84s)]
*  Now that's so obviously illegal and wrong and corrupt [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=597.12s)]
*  that you'd probably wanna make sure nobody wrote about it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=602.72s)]
*  And that's why Sam Bankmanfried also bought off the media. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=604.84s)]
*  He handed millions to places like Vox, The Intercept, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=607.92s)]
*  Semifor, ProPublica, and probably many others. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=611.12s)]
*  So with tens of billions of dollars evaporating [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=615.08s)]
*  into thin air and Sam Bankmanfried not even [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=618.2s)]
*  within the borders of the United States tonight, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=620.24s)]
*  the question is where investors left? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=622.44s)]
*  There are a lot of big retirement funds [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=625.4s)]
*  who are invested in this thing, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=627.6s)]
*  in this country and in Canada. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=628.6s)]
*  Will they get any of their money back? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=630.6s)]
*  What about the money that Sam Bankmanfried [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  gave to the Democratic Party? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=635.24s)]
*  Will the Democrats have to give it back [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=636.6s)]
*  to the people who are defrauded? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=639.0799999999999s)]
*  Will the media companies that took it, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=640.36s)]
*  Semifor for example, have to give it back [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=641.68s)]
*  to the people whose money was effectively stolen? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, Maxine Waters was a beneficiary of this [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=647.04s)]
*  and she was asked today whether she's returning [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=649.1999999999999s)]
*  any of these donations. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  Fox's Hillary Vaughn just caught up with Waters [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=652.48s)]
*  and she made it very clear, of course, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=654.88s)]
*  she's keeping the money. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=657.1600000000001s)]
*  Do you think some lawmakers that got donations [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=658.76s)]
*  from FTX's founder should give that money back? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=661.32s)]
*  Well, I don't want to get into that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=664.0400000000001s)]
*  As a matter of fact, both sides, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=665.36s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans have received donations. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=667.0400000000001s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=669.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, everyone did it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  No, actually everyone didn't do it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=673.48s)]
*  This was the finance arm of the Democratic Party, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=675.24s)]
*  one of the biggest stories of the year, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=679.08s)]
*  maybe the last 10 years. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=681.44s)]
*  We're gonna have a lot more on it tomorrow [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=682.52s)]
*  and in the weeks to come. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=684.64s)]
*  But why are we telling you about it tonight? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=685.52s)]
*  We're telling you about it because you should know [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  that FTX was also in partnership [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=688.52s)]
*  with the government of Ukraine [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=691.72s)]
*  because all threads return to the same spool. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=693.88s)]
*  It'd be interesting to know how much money, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=696.92s)]
*  if any, Ukraine funneled back to FTX, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=698.52s)]
*  which then wound up in the hands of Democrats [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=701.08s)]
*  running for Congress in this last cycle. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=702.84s)]
*  We don't know the answer. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=705.58s)]
*  An audit might tell us there has been no audit. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=706.78s)]
*  Today in the House, Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=710.28s)]
*  has been demanding an audit, but to no avail so far. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=711.92s)]
*  And that means the tens of billions of your tax dollars [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  the Biden administration has shoveled [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=718.48s)]
*  to the government of Ukraine remain, as of tonight, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=720.0s)]
*  completely unaccounted for. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=723.2s)]
*  We don't know what happened to the money. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=725.68s)]
*  And still the Ukrainians are demanding more [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=727.72s)]
*  and trying to get us into a world war [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=729.48s)]
*  that would benefit us in no way. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=731.52s)]
*  Are Republicans supporting this? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=734.64s)]
*  Could any Republican possibly support this? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=736.4s)]
*  More money for Ukraine with no audit? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=739.34s)]
*  Any Republican who does deserves, at the very least, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=741.6s)]
*  a lifetime of scorn. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMHBsHtolCA&t=744.08s)]
