# Former Idaho murder house tenant says 'diligent planning' would've been needed to commit killings
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8)
*  When four students at the University of Idaho were brutally murdered more than a month ago in their rented home, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=0.0s)]
*  police didn't have any suspects at first. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=6.24s)]
*  But today, police identified the killer as Brian Coburger. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=8.74s)]
*  He's a graduate student in criminology at nearby Washington State University. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Now, many people are wondering how Coburger was able to commit this horrible crime and then evade capture for so long. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  Now, Rob McQueen used to live in that very same rented home where these murders occurred. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  And he says that these killings would have required a lot of planning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=29.84s)]
*  Rob, thanks for making time to join us here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=33.84s)]
*  You bring a perspective that I think no one else has shared just yet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=37.34s)]
*  How did you find out that this occurred in the place that you lived when you were going through college? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=41.84s)]
*  And what ran through your mind? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=46.84s)]
*  Hi, Tulsi. Thanks for having me on. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=49.84s)]
*  So I actually found out about this through group chat with my former roommates where we lived together [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=52.84s)]
*  when I was actually working in Ukraine. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=57.84s)]
*  So it was a very quick group chat and it was really a shock to kind of sit and think you have that initial reaction of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=59.84s)]
*  I can't believe that I used to live there and then you have the reaction of I can't believe this happened in my state. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=66.84s)]
*  And I think it's important to look at this not just in the details that we can get so lost in a crime that's so brutal [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=72.34s)]
*  and really has created so much conspiracy theory and thoughts and speculation, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=78.84s)]
*  but really look at it in the impact of the lives and the family of those four people that were slain, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=83.84s)]
*  the impact of the University of Idaho and the Moscow community, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=89.84s)]
*  and the impact in Idaho as a whole. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=93.84s)]
*  This is not something that normally happens in this state. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=95.84s)]
*  This is going to leave an impact for a very long time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=98.84s)]
*  Yeah. So Rob, I mean, you served in the United States Army for 15 years. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=103.84s)]
*  You're a military veteran. You've deployed a number of times. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=108.84s)]
*  And you were doing humanitarian work in Ukraine when you found out about this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=110.84s)]
*  As you think about those halls and those rooms that you lived in, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=114.84s)]
*  tell us what had to go into this murderer being able to commit such a heinous crime in that house. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=119.84s)]
*  So when you look at the layout of the house, right, it's basically an old build with a newer build on top and it's built into a hillside. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=128.84s)]
*  So if you address kind of the first theories with the surviving roommates that were living on the first floor, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=136.84s)]
*  that they would have heard something, that they were there, you have to understand that the structure of the house, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=141.84s)]
*  those first two rooms, are built just underneath the living room and then are also built into a hillside. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=147.84s)]
*  So then when you move to the second floor of this house, you get to the main level that enters two bedrooms, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=155.84s)]
*  one bedroom directly across from the kitchen and next to the stairs that goes up to the third floor. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=160.84s)]
*  And then that kitchen enters onto a back patio, which is on that hillside. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=165.84s)]
*  So that second layer where the kitchen is, where that second bedroom is, and where the stairs that go up, that move to the third floor are, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=169.84s)]
*  that is not above those other two bedrooms. So it's really important to understand that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=176.84s)]
*  So you're not going to hear a lot from that basement level there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=180.84s)]
*  And then once you move from that sliding glass door, you run directly into the entrance to a bedroom. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=184.84s)]
*  And then to your right, you have to go up the stairs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=190.84s)]
*  And when you think about a third floor, you have to think of this in college housing, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=193.84s)]
*  So when you move up to that third floor, it's a narrow stairway. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=197.84s)]
*  It enters into a very, very small hallway. And then the entrance to two rooms, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=201.84s)]
*  the room that the murders took place in and another room that was unoccupied. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=206.84s)]
*  And that is a really just the layout and the complexity of getting to that part. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=210.84s)]
*  You could either be completely not worried about the impact of what would happen to you should you be caught, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=215.84s)]
*  or you had to diligently plan and understand the layout of that house to move in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=222.84s)]
*  and actually leave that space without like really causing alarm and being caught. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=228.84s)]
*  Yeah, Rob, it is chilling to think about the footsteps that that killer took to commit that crime. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=233.84s)]
*  I know that a lot more details will be coming out very soon. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=240.84s)]
*  Thanks for sharing your firsthand account of what could have happened that day in that house. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=243.84s)]
*  I appreciate it. And thank you for your service. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuA5UGEJo8&t=248.84s)]
