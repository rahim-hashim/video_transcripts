# Larry Elder: 'We just don't know' what happened in the Paul Pelosi attack
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY)
*  Well, speaking of lying that's happening right in front of us, it has been more than a month [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=0.0s)]
*  since Paul Pelosi was attacked in his home on a Friday night in San Francisco. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=6.48s)]
*  The assailant, we know who he was, he was a hippie nudist called David De Pape who we're [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=11.6s)]
*  told was some sort of right-wing extremist, despite being apparently a Black Lives Matter [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=16.44s)]
*  fan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=20.96s)]
*  According to NBC News, Paul Pelosi didn't seem afraid of De Pape, even after police [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=21.96s)]
*  arrived. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=26.8s)]
*  In fact, he opened the door for the cops himself. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=28.0s)]
*  So what exactly happened in the Pelosi house that night? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=31.36s)]
*  Well, there have been a lot of conspiracy theories about it and people who've put those [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=34.04s)]
*  forward have been attacked for it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=38.32s)]
*  You're crazy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=39.92s)]
*  So there's one way to end this debate immediately and it would be a constitutional way to end [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=41.16s)]
*  it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=46.08s)]
*  In fact, we should be demanding it and that's to see the body cam footage from that night [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=47.08s)]
*  because these police are public servants. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=50.32s)]
*  They work for the rest of us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  They have no right to hide that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  But the police, for some reason, have refused to release that body cam footage. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=55.98s)]
*  We get body cam footage every day in the news business, but they won't release this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  And only when they not release it, they are intent on not releasing it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=63.54s)]
*  In De Pape's federal court case, a judge has just issued a protective order banning the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=66.86s)]
*  release of sensitive information in this case and that would include the body cam footage. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=71.78s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=76.62s)]
*  Why are they hiding this? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=77.62s)]
*  Is there a good reason? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=78.62s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  Larry Elder ran for governor of California, a state in which he lives and has lived for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  many years. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=85.86s)]
*  He joins us tonight to assess what's going on here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=86.86s)]
*  Larry Elder, thanks for coming on. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=88.66s)]
*  What do you think this is? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=89.9s)]
*  Why can't we just end this conversation with the evidence that we have a right to see? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=91.02s)]
*  Of course, we're speculating, but somebody does not want somebody to know what really [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=96.1s)]
*  happened that day. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=101.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=102.12s)]
*  The NBC reporter who reported that Pelosi calmly opened the door, said he had a hammer [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=103.82s)]
*  in his hand and calmly walked back. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=108.94s)]
*  That guy got suspended. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=111.3s)]
*  So we don't really know what's happening. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=112.9s)]
*  We haven't seen any footage. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=115.42s)]
*  We haven't seen any audio. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=116.76s)]
*  We don't know what the witnesses are saying. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=118.7s)]
*  Maybe Paul Pelosi knew the guy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=121.5s)]
*  Maybe Nancy Pelosi knew the guy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=123.54s)]
*  Maybe Paul invited him in. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=125.86s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=127.3s)]
*  All I know is that the official story that we've heard, which is very simple, this guy [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  broke into Paul Pelosi's house and attacked him, does not appear to be the case. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=134.5s)]
*  Otherwise, why so secretive? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=138.38s)]
*  Why not tell what's going on? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=140.06s)]
*  Why the gag order? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=141.84s)]
*  I've never seen a thing like this in a criminal case. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=142.84s)]
*  What's infuriating, I mean, I should just say, I think Paul Pelosi is a very nice man. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=146.1s)]
*  I've met him and I like Paul Pelosi. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=148.66s)]
*  I'm not interested in what Paul Pelosi was doing there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=150.62s)]
*  And I wouldn't be doing this story with you right now if they hadn't used it to attack [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=152.45999999999998s)]
*  their political opponents. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=156.42s)]
*  Oh, this is January 6th and the right wing is attacking the Pelosi family. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=157.42s)]
*  They used this story to attack their political opponents, so we have an absolute right and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  obligation to get to the bottom of it, correct? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=168.94s)]
*  I said something snarky about it after I made sure that Paul Pelosi was going to recover [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=169.94s)]
*  fully and I was attacked and other conservatives were attacked for speculating that something [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=174.06s)]
*  might have gone wrong or something might be different than what they're telling us. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=178.1s)]
*  So you're quite right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=182.5s)]
*  We ought to know what the story is. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=183.5s)]
*  But we were attacked. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=185.0s)]
*  It was used to show how insensitive and cold and callous conservatives are right before [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=186.22s)]
*  the midterms. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=190.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=191.54s)]
*  They'll use literally anything, even her husband's attack. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=192.54s)]
*  It's really unbelievable. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=196.28s)]
*  As you well know, having been attacked, Larry Elder, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=197.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=200.3s)]
*  I'm the black face of white supremacy, Tucker. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  That's my favorite attack ever. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=204.9s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGRgdml1sY&t=206.5s)]
