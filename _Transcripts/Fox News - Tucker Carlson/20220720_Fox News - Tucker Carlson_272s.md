# Widow of murdered police captain speaks out about her husband's death
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k)
*  It's weird how the BLM riots following the death of George Floyd have just been completely [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=0.0s)]
*  memory-holed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=4.2s)]
*  You never hear anybody mention them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=5.2s)]
*  We remember, however, and we have the video. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=6.3s)]
*  So in June of 2020, BLM rioters were destroying the city of St. Louis, which is a great city. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=8.6s)]
*  It didn't need to be knocked around any more than it already has been, but that's what [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=13.16s)]
*  they were doing, burning things. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=16.76s)]
*  Around two in the morning, a 77-year-old retired police captain called David Dorn was alerted [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=18.48s)]
*  to a burglar alarm that went off at a friend's pawn shop, so he showed up to investigate [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  like a good citizen. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=27.46s)]
*  When he arrived, he was murdered. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=29.16s)]
*  You almost never hear his name. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=30.68s)]
*  BLM never mentions it, neither do the huge companies that have paid for BLM. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=33.08s)]
*  And of course, the media has ignored it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=38.36s)]
*  But the trial of the man who is believed to be the killer, a guy called Stephen Cannon, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=40.64s)]
*  just began this week, and we thought it was a perfect time to speak to Captain David Dorn's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=45.2s)]
*  widow and who joins us tonight. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=49.8s)]
*  Mrs. Dorn, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=51.92s)]
*  And this has got to be awful for you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=55.56s)]
*  Do you think, just to what's going on right now, first, do you think the man accused of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=58.22s)]
*  your husband's murder will be brought to justice? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=64.02s)]
*  I'm praying. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=69.02s)]
*  I'm going to have, I'm trying to have faith in the justice system. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=70.02s)]
*  Good. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=73.22s)]
*  Well, I hope it's well placed. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=74.22s)]
*  I have to ask, because I can't resist, this didn't happen in a vacuum these riots were [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=76.06s)]
*  paid for by the biggest companies in the United States, all of whom seem to have escaped criticism. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=80.5s)]
*  Why does nobody mention that this was all financed by corporate America, do you think? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=86.98s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's the woke community that is funding them, not only just these corporations, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  but celebrities and athletes across the country are funding them, just blindly funding this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=99.94s)]
*  misguided agenda. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=106.94s)]
*  Well, it certainly affected you and derailed your life. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=109.14s)]
*  Your husband was murdered. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=115.66s)]
*  What would you say to them? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=117.94s)]
*  I don't think they've had to confront the human cost of what they paid for. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=118.94s)]
*  No, and it's just not me. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=121.94s)]
*  There's other widows out there, you know, of law enforcement. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=124.38s)]
*  You know, Black Lives Matter called for the death of police and nobody's done anything [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=126.94s)]
*  about it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=130.5s)]
*  You know, defund, demean and kill police officers across the country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=131.5s)]
*  And you know, we're the enemy now when it's not, when we're not. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=135.74s)]
*  It's, you know, there's other factors involved, but we seemed, you know, the police seemed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=142.34s)]
*  to be the easy target and nobody's standing up for their rights. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=145.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=150.26s)]
*  And I mean, these are people, I mean, did your husband get rich in law enforcement? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=151.26s)]
*  Does anybody get rich in law enforcement? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=155.34s)]
*  No, neither of us did. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=157.34s)]
*  I did 28 years as well and neither one of us got rich in this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=159.94s)]
*  And we don't, we don't become police officers to become rich. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=162.94s)]
*  We become police officers because we have, it's a calling just like it is. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=165.72s)]
*  It's calling to become a priest or calling to become a doctor. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=168.98s)]
*  In our blood, it's what we want to do. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=172.54s)]
*  So as you pointed out, BLM was calling for the murder of police officers back during [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=175.38s)]
*  the Obama administration. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=179.2s)]
*  You know, fry like bacon, pigs in a blanket, fry like bacon. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that video was on Fox News. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=184.28s)]
*  No one at the Justice Department did anything about that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=187.88s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=190.88s)]
*  And they were, you know, they were burning down cities and they were calling it peaceful [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=192.8s)]
*  protests and there was nothing peaceful about it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=195.64s)]
*  This must, having suffered as you have, this must, this must drive you crazy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=200.64s)]
*  It does, you know, and now having to sit through a trial of a man who's accused of killing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=207.04s)]
*  my husband when the riot was funded and organized by Black Lives Matter and all these corporations. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=210.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=218.14s)]
*  Well, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to, I know you're being dragged through this already, but I [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=219.14s)]
*  just think it's important to see the faces of the people who've suffered and you're certainly [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=224.06s)]
*  one of them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=227.73999999999998s)]
*  So I'm grateful that you came on tonight. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=229.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=230.84s)]
*  And if anybody wants to know more about, you know, these woke corporations, they can go [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=231.84s)]
*  to www.concerncommunities.org forward slash pledge. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  It's a group of Black clergy who've got together to stand up to these woke corporations, athletes [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=242.06s)]
*  and celebrities. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=247.5s)]
*  I've actually done that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  And there's a video on that site that's so unbelievable. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=250.54000000000002s)]
*  And I hope that everyone watching tonight will go see that video. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  It wrecked my day, but in a good way. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7S-fPBrJ1k&t=256.94s)]
