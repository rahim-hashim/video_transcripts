# Jesse Watters labels Fauci 'the perfect Hollywood actress'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY)
*  Well, Tony Fauci is now a figure of religious veneration to the kind of Americans who think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=0.0s)]
*  Starbucks makes good coffee. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=6.2s)]
*  So it makes sense, as a God-destroying-the-Earth, that Tony Fauci has his very own hagiographic [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=8.44s)]
*  film. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=15.72s)]
*  And he does. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=16.72s)]
*  It features interviews with Bono, Susan Rice, Bill Gates, and some of the rest of the worst [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=17.72s)]
*  people in the world. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=21.66s)]
*  But the best part of the documentary, needless to say, comes from Tony Fauci himself, who [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=22.88s)]
*  is, not surprisingly, the world's greatest fan of Tony Fauci. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=27.2s)]
*  Here for example is Tony Fauci explaining why so many Americans don't trust him. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm the bad guy to an entire subset of people because I represent something that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=34.76s)]
*  is uncomfortable for them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=42.84s)]
*  It's called the truth. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=44.84s)]
*  They can't handle the truth! [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=45.84s)]
*  Those Americans! [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=50.0s)]
*  Keep in mind, some people may distrust Tony Fauci for other reasons like he's a liar, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=52.0s)]
*  and he's admitted it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=57.84s)]
*  He lied about scientific data, for example, about herd immunity, and he's admitted it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=59.0s)]
*  But in the documentary, Tony Fauci's taking the long view, and he's begging historians [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=64.64s)]
*  to forget all of that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=68.72s)]
*  I hope that if historians look back, if they ever would want to look back at what I've [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=71.6s)]
*  done and my life, maybe somebody says, hey, that guy was pretty good. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=79.2s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=87.28s)]
*  So there's a vaccinated man wearing a mask alone outside. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=88.28s)]
*  That's clearly a sign of mental illness, but the film makes it seem like heroism. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  What do we make of this? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Jesse Waters is the host of Waters World and the author of the fantastic book How I Saved [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=100.84s)]
*  the World, which he basically did. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  He joins us to assess the Tony Fauci movie. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Jesse Waters, have you seen this? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=109.56s)]
*  No, and I don't plan on it, but he really is the perfect Hollywood actress. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=111.68s)]
*  Craves attention, loves drama, and if you criticize his performance, oh, they only hate [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=118.0s)]
*  me because I'm beautiful. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=124.0s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=125.48s)]
*  We don't hate the truth. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=127.86s)]
*  We just want Tony to tell it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=129.84s)]
*  We trust the science. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=132.52s)]
*  We just don't trust that scientist because, Tucker, this is the same guy that funded the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=134.0s)]
*  risky research in that sloppy lab that sprung this pandemic, and then he kept us all locked [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=140.28s)]
*  inside to protect us from a virus that mostly spreads inside. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=148.24s)]
*  So instead of resigning and doing the right thing, he goes on television and actually [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=153.8s)]
*  suggests that future historians document his life and treat him as a hero. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=158.2s)]
*  Now, as someone with a healthy ego, Tucker, even I blush at something like that, but maybe [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=165.32s)]
*  this is just satire from Disney. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=171.32s)]
*  I mean, they do use Susan Rice as a character witness for Anthony Fauci, the Benghazi bag [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  lady, or maybe this is just Disney paying Fauci back because Disney shares didn't go [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=180.76s)]
*  up 100 percent during the Fauci lockdowns. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  Remember, everybody just sat home and watched Disney Plus, and they got all those Beijing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  profits coming in because Tony ran interference for the lab leak. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=194.56s)]
*  So maybe it's just payback. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=199.0s)]
*  But what about the filmmakers? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=201.33999999999997s)]
*  I mean, if you're interviewing the guy who helped create COVID-19, lied about it, got [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  caught, funded these Frankenstein experiments that wrecked the United States, wouldn't you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=208.16s)]
*  feel obligated to ask him about it? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=212.04s)]
*  It's too late because now the media has anointed him. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=215.32s)]
*  Remember, he's Lord Lockdown, arch enemy of Donald Trump, savior of everything scientific [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  and holy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=225.88s)]
*  The media were early investors in the Fauci narrative. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=226.88s)]
*  Remember, they rode the Fauci wave from the lockdowns to the ballots all the way to power [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  in the White House. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=236.2s)]
*  Same with Big Tech and Big Pharma. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=237.2s)]
*  They're in on this too. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=239.4s)]
*  He's too big to fail. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=240.92s)]
*  They can't pump and dump and sell him like they did Cuomo. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=242.84s)]
*  They can't burst the Fauci bubble. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=246.48s)]
*  There's too much money locked in. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=248.6s)]
*  The guy's uncancellable, even though he's about yay big. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  That is such a smart, they can't pump and dump like they did Cuomo. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=255.84s)]
*  I wish I'd thought of that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=258.6s)]
*  Man, is that perfect. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=259.6s)]
*  Jesse Waters, thank you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=260.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=263.16s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZcXFZpfmY&t=272.84s)]
