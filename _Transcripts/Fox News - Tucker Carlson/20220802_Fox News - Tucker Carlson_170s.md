# China's plans to destroy US: 'Every time, we lose'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM)
*  Harry Kaziannis is the president of the Rogue States Project. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight to assess where China is in all this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=3.34s)]
*  Harry, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  So I guess the question is to what extent is China bluffing, if any? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=8.1s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=11.76s)]
*  Oh, Tucker, I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=12.76s)]
*  They're not bluffing at all. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=15.46s)]
*  They have been preparing for this scenario for 30 years. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=16.46s)]
*  If you go back to 1995, 1996, we had a similar situation with China when Taiwan's president [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=20.26s)]
*  was wanting to come back to Cornell University to visit his alma mater. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=26.32s)]
*  We had a very similar crisis. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=29.82s)]
*  But at the time, the United States was the overwhelming military superpower. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=31.14s)]
*  We had no problems worrying about China. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=36.12s)]
*  In fact, Chinese military officials couldn't even find our aircraft carriers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=37.86s)]
*  Today, the situation is very different. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=41.86s)]
*  The Chinese have prepped for this scenario. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=43.9s)]
*  They have thousands of ballistic cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, carrier killer missiles. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=45.86s)]
*  So if there was ever a war between the United States and China, the first thing they're [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=52.0s)]
*  going to do is they are going to attack with a bolt from the blue. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  They're going to destroy our satellites in orbit. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=58.46s)]
*  They're going to destroy our communications equipment. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  We're not going to be fighting about transgender issues on TikTok anymore because TikTok's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=62.86s)]
*  not going to work in the United States. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=66.74s)]
*  And then they're going to destroy our aircraft carriers, destroy all of our bases in Asia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=68.64s)]
*  This has all been wargamed out. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=73.04s)]
*  I've actually fought this war in simulators for over 10 years. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=74.22s)]
*  You know what happens every time, Tucker? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=77.88s)]
*  We lose. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=79.5s)]
*  So, I mean, everyone prays it would never get to a point anywhere near what you described, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=80.5s)]
*  but of course it could. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=85.7s)]
*  And the Chinese have not been, I don't think, very subtle about telegraphing their intentions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=86.7s)]
*  In the face of this looming threat from this rising power, how has the entire United States [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  Congress sat back and continued to fund a military that gets weaker and more politicized [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=97.88s)]
*  every year? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=101.78s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=102.78s)]
*  I don't either, Tucker, to be honest with you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=105.38s)]
*  A lot of this is misprioritization. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=107.14s)]
*  It feels like we're forever stuck in a Cold War mindset. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=110.06s)]
*  idea that we're the dominant hegemon. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=114.18s)]
*  A lot of our foreign policy thinking seems like it's stuck in the 1990s, the unipolar [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=116.30000000000001s)]
*  moment, if you will, where the United States is omnipotent, can do anything. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=120.94000000000001s)]
*  Nothing can happen to us. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=124.98s)]
*  We've got the Atlantic, the Pacific, we've got Canada and Mexico, and nothing can permeate [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=126.18s)]
*  our space. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=132.3s)]
*  But I think 9-11 proved that that obviously can happen. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=133.3s)]
*  And I think China proves that this threat is very real. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=137.26000000000002s)]
*  And let's face it, Tucker, we're not ready for it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=139.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=142.02s)]
*  If this moment doesn't freeze the renewable energy cult in its tracks and makes a laughing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=143.02s)]
*  stock of anybody who suggests turning our grid over to China, I don't know, honestly, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  what will. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=154.58s)]
*  Harry, great to see you tonight. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=155.58s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=156.58s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJxBIUBaZM&t=157.58s)]
