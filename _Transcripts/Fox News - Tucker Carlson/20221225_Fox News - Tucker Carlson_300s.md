# ‘Christmas Karens’ are looking for what they can be triggered by: Tom Cotter
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY)
*  So remember the fake outrage over the Christmas song, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=0.0s)]
*  Baby, It's Cold Outside? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=4.12s)]
*  You were supposed to be very mad about that song. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=5.54s)]
*  Part of a broader effort to destroy everything [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=8.08s)]
*  you grew up with that was good, your history, your culture, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=10.1s)]
*  but they told us the time was me too. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=13.8s)]
*  Well, comedian Tom Cotter remembers that very well, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=15.76s)]
*  and he noted that that song generated a lot more outrage [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=18.48s)]
*  among lifestyle liberals than a pop song [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=22.88s)]
*  about women's genitals. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=25.36s)]
*  So Tom Cotter's bit on this is all over the internet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=27.06s)]
*  You may have seen it if you haven't, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=30.26s)]
*  and here's part of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  And the one that really killed me was last Christmas, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=32.22s)]
*  we canceled a song that was written in the 1940s [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=34.1s)]
*  called Baby, It's Cold Outside, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=36.9s)]
*  which is fine if you feel that way, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=38.3s)]
*  but at the exact same time, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=39.74s)]
*  the number one song in this nation for over two months [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=41.22s)]
*  was Wet A*****y. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=43.66s)]
*  I am not making that up. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=44.7s)]
*  You can look it up. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Google it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=47.14s)]
*  So I want to wrap up my show by comparing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=48.78s)]
*  and contrasting the lyrics of these two songs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  If indeed this country has lost its f***ing mind, shall we? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=57.13999999999999s)]
*  Let's start with the hardly offensive Christmas song [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=61.739999999999995s)]
*  written just after World War II. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=64.22s)]
*  I really can't stay, baby, it's cold outside. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=68.06s)]
*  I gotta go away, baby, it's cold outside. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=70.78s)]
*  This evening has been so very nice. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=73.3s)]
*  Yeah, you f***ing with some wet a*****y. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=77.58s)]
*  Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet a*****y. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=80.94s)]
*  Beat it up and word extra large, extra hard. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=84.86s)]
*  Put this p***y right in your face. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=87.74s)]
*  Swipe your nose like a credit card. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=89.62s)]
*  So when you destroy people's culture, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=95.02s)]
*  you replace it with something new, a new culture. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=98.02s)]
*  And he pointed out what the new culture is. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=100.78s)]
*  And it's not just baby, it's cold outside [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=103.18s)]
*  because it's not just one song. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=104.66s)]
*  It's everything you grew up with, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=105.86s)]
*  everything that you thought made this country decent, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=107.62s)]
*  all the happy memories from your childhood are now banned. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=109.7s)]
*  So that would include Christmas carols like [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=111.94s)]
*  God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=113.58s)]
*  We found this video from 2020 of people singing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  the new woke version of God Rest Ye Weary Gentlemen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=118.7s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=121.94s)]
*  God rest you also women [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=122.78s)]
*  With no wind against your face [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=125.9s)]
*  Who think and plan, create, design and finish, yet displace [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=129.5s)]
*  God rest you queer and questioning [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=137.42s)]
*  Your anxious must be sealed [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=140.62s)]
*  We believe that you are deeply known [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=143.86s)]
*  And honorable to win [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=147.18s)]
*  So again, the point is not to make it anything more inclusive. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=150.74s)]
*  It's to destroy the things that you love. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=152.86s)]
*  Tom Cotter of course knows that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=154.66s)]
*  Comedians are really insightful. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=156.22s)]
*  That's why they're comedians. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=157.82s)]
*  Tom Cotter, who you just saw joins us now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=159.5s)]
*  Tom, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=161.18s)]
*  So what inspired you to compare yesterday's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=163.82s)]
*  deeply offensive song with today's totally okay song? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=167.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not trying to bash anyone over the head [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=172.5s)]
*  with my politics, but I just think [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=174.66s)]
*  you gotta draw a line in the sand somewhere. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=176.98s)]
*  Like I consider Christmas a birthday party. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=179.26s)]
*  It's a birthday party for the baby Jesus. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=182.14s)]
*  And these people want to destroy a kid's birthday party, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=183.86s)]
*  which I think is outrageous. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  They wake up in the morning waiting to be outraged. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=187.86s)]
*  What can I be triggered by today [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=190.54s)]
*  so I can become a Christmas Karen [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=191.94s)]
*  and ruin it for everybody else? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=193.66s)]
*  And how long before White Christmas is deemed racist? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=195.54s)]
*  Or ho ho ho is offensive to people [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=199.1s)]
*  in the entertainment industry? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=203.34s)]
*  Or candy canes are offensive to handicapped people? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=204.54s)]
*  You gotta draw a line somewhere [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=207.58s)]
*  or it's just gonna get further and further out of control [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=209.26s)]
*  and I'm just done with the woke people destroying it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=211.9s)]
*  Well, I completely agree. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=215.1s)]
*  And ho ho ho is offensive to sex workers, as you know, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=216.18s)]
*  but we say it anyway. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=218.7s)]
*  So what's the response when you point this out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=220.9s)]
*  in the hilarious way you do? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=224.26s)]
*  Well, I've been eviscerated by some. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=228.14s)]
*  You know, what kills me is it's young millennial men [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=230.7s)]
*  that are really coming after me. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=233.62s)]
*  I thought it would be, maybe I'm sexist, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=235.26s)]
*  but I thought it would be millennial women, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=238.22s)]
*  but it's really the men that are coming after me [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=239.66s)]
*  and really taking shots at me on my posts and stuff. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=242.18s)]
*  But most people, the vast majority are positive [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=245.66s)]
*  because I think the vast majority believe as I do [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  that these are traditions that we hold dear, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=250.54s)]
*  that we've hold on to for our whole lives. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=252.74s)]
*  My kids have never asked what Santa's pronouns are. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  They don't care, you know what I mean? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=257.1s)]
*  And what about the systematic oppression of the elves? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=258.54s)]
*  When do we give them reparations? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=261.98s)]
*  And how come the reindeer aren't more inclusive? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=263.5s)]
*  They're all cisgender males, aren't they? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=266.14s)]
*  Well, prancer maybe, but you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  at some point you just have to say, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=271.02s)]
*  no, there shouldn't be an elk or a caribou. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  They're reindeer. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=274.58s)]
*  They went after the Santa Claus, the movie by Tim Allen. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=275.54s)]
*  They said it was fat shaming. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=278.14s)]
*  It's Santa, he's fat. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=279.7s)]
*  Can we get over it? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=282.34s)]
*  Can we just move on with our lives [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=283.17999999999995s)]
*  and not ruin it for kids? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  Tom Cotter, thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QetcODMiY&t=285.97999999999996s)]
