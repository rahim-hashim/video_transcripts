# Devin Nunes responds to report DOJ issued subpoenas to House intel staffers
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E)
*  If that seems out of control, if you're starting to conclude that the federal agencies are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=0.0s)]
*  out of control and have hollowed out democracy to the point where it's not recognizable, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=3.44s)]
*  here's a shocking story. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=8.92s)]
*  New reporting tonight from John Solon at the website Just the News reveals that DOJ began [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=10.74s)]
*  spying on the U.S. Congress in 2017. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=15.42s)]
*  Specifically, DOJ sought grand journey subpoenas for the personal emails of at least two staffers [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=19.72s)]
*  on the House Intel Committee, including Cash Patel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=24.66s)]
*  Now this is right around the time the House Intel Committee was probing the Russia collusion [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=27.84s)]
*  hoax. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=32.32s)]
*  Now Devin Nunes, you would think, would be beyond attack by the agencies since he was [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=33.32s)]
*  the chairman of the House Intel Committee at the time. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=39.2s)]
*  He was the guy overseeing the Intel agencies. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=42.36s)]
*  But it looks like he wasn't, we now know. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=45.0s)]
*  Devin Nunes joins us tonight. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=48.08s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  I should say it looks like you were spied upon as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=54.24s)]
*  What do you make of this now that we know it for sure? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=60.2s)]
*  Well look, at this point, Tucker, it appears to be that it's not just a couple staff, it [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=63.32000000000001s)]
*  looks like it probably is more. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  We only have a couple subpoenas at this point, so this is probably just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=71.36s)]
*  And what this is, remember, they targeted my lawyers. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  And if you go back to the time frame, what was happening? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  We were in a brawl with the Department of Justice and the FBI because we caught them [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=84.52s)]
*  spying on the Trump campaign and other Republican operatives in 2016 that continued on to 2017. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=89.92s)]
*  At this time, we had confronted high-level folks at the highest level of the Department [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=98.44s)]
*  of Justice and the FBI saying that, look, we think you guys might have a problem here, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=103.12s)]
*  too. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=109.12s)]
*  Maybe you should recuse yourself, maybe you shouldn't be involved. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=110.12s)]
*  You would have thought they would have got to the bottom of it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=113.0s)]
*  But instead what they did is they did this cute little way of reverse targeting me by [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=115.34s)]
*  going after my staff to figure out how did we know this information? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=120.22s)]
*  What were we going to do with this information? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=124.86s)]
*  And this was all just months before we made this all public that the FBI used the Clinton [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=126.62s)]
*  and DNC dirt to spy on Trump and the Trump campaign. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=132.36s)]
*  You can't have a democracy in which unelected bureaucrats with guns control elected officials. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=137.24s)]
*  That is not a democracy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  Why does no one burn this down and start again? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=146.5s)]
*  It's the most serious possible threat. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=150.02s)]
*  It's a much greater threat than any foreign government. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=151.56s)]
*  Why does no one ever do anything about this? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, we tried, Tucker, and we made 14 criminal referrals. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=155.36s)]
*  I assume John Durham has that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=161.96s)]
*  Now, look, a lot of these referrals did involve lying and misleading Congress, obstruction [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=164.2s)]
*  of justice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=169.12s)]
*  These are all things if I'm John Durham, I know that they're trying to close him down, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=170.48s)]
*  the Biden administration is to close him down. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  But I think Congress, my former colleague, should be pushing this information, ask Durham [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=176.04s)]
*  to look at this, because this is clearly in the realm of what John Durham's scope was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=181.28s)]
*  to look at. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=186.32s)]
*  And I know he brought some cases in D.C. against citizens. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=187.56s)]
*  He has yet to bring any charges against the very people who we trust with these really [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=192.26s)]
*  high level powers that appear to, well, not appear, they did. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=198.14s)]
*  I mean, they turned it against the United States Congress to try to figure out, either [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=202.34s)]
*  to try to figure out what we were doing or try to get blackmail on us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=205.82s)]
*  And it's very clear that members of Congress are being blackmailed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=210.7s)]
*  I can say that maybe you can't, but it's true, as you know. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=213.18s)]
*  Devin Nunes, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=215.94s)]
*  Thank you for bringing this to our attention. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=217.89999999999998s)]
*  Always a pleasure. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_lvFxZ8E&t=220.85999999999999s)]
