# Clay Higgins on AOC outburst: 'Her anger was just unbelievable'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA)
*  Clay Higgins represents the state of Louisiana. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=1.6s)]
*  I mean, did you, I'm just wondering [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=4.16s)]
*  what was going through your mind. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=5.92s)]
*  You asked the basic question. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=6.96s)]
*  How is society gonna function without petrochemicals? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=9.36s)]
*  Did you expect her to give you some answer? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=11.84s)]
*  Well, I knew that her positions were insane. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=16.16s)]
*  I mean, Ms. Salter is a radical climate attorney, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=19.44s)]
*  some likely a friend of AOC's. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=23.6s)]
*  This was in the midst of a week [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=26.32s)]
*  where we had to endure committee hearing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=29.52s)]
*  after committee hearing where the Democrats [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=32.32s)]
*  were smashing the American energy industry [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=35.04s)]
*  and promoting the absurdities of the furthest reaches [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=38.08s)]
*  of the Green New Deal. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=42.64s)]
*  And their star witness after two days of hearings [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=43.84s)]
*  on the second panel on the second day [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  was this lady, Ms. Salter. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=52.16s)]
*  So I had possession of her written testimony. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=54.16s)]
*  I'd read it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  I was prepared. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  And I knew how crazy it read. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  But then when she delivered it in her opening statement, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  she was quite vitriolic. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  She was practically spitting at us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=66.64s)]
*  And her anger was just unbelievable. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  So I knew when I had the chance to, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=71.19999999999999s)]
*  I was gonna shut her down with her own craziness. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=73.44s)]
*  Boy, you did such a good job. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=76.88s)]
*  Thank you for doing that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=78.24s)]
*  Congressman Higgins of Louisiana. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=79.28s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKHw54ttEKA&t=80.64s)]
