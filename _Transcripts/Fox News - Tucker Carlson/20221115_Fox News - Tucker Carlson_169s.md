# Sen. Josh Hawley: Republicans 'weren't offering' what independents wanted
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg)
*  Senator Josh Hawley represents Missouri in the U.S. Senate, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=0.0s)]
*  and he joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=4.16s)]
*  Thanks for joining us, Senator Hawley. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=6.3s)]
*  You've talked about in a tweet recently [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  about how it's time for a change in the GOP, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=11.44s)]
*  that it's time for new leadership in the Republican Party. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=15.44s)]
*  And having served in Congress for eight years, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=18.34s)]
*  I know how much pressure there is [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  for members of both parties to follow leadership, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=23.16s)]
*  go in lockstep, vote party line. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=25.92s)]
*  I think that's really, there's a lot of different issues, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=29.04s)]
*  but what kind of leadership do you envision [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=31.18s)]
*  for this new Republican Party [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=33.76s)]
*  that gives people the freedom and independence [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=35.379999999999995s)]
*  to actually vote their conscience? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, we need good, strong independent leadership [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  that actually listens to voters [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=43.32s)]
*  and doesn't just listen to the Washington lobbyists. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=44.72s)]
*  And I'll just tell you, when it comes to the GOP, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=46.66s)]
*  the Washington Republicanism [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=49.2s)]
*  that cares more about Wall Street [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=50.86s)]
*  than it does about working people, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=52.76s)]
*  it's time for that to come to an end. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=54.2s)]
*  The Washington Republicanism that's all about, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=56.0s)]
*  adventures abroad, the neoconservatism [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=58.54s)]
*  of these global wars, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  not focused on working people in this country, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  it needs to come to an end. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=64.94s)]
*  I think what voters are asking us to do is pretty clear. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=66.1s)]
*  Secure our streets. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=68.62s)]
*  You know, let's put new cops on the street, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=69.92s)]
*  100,000 of them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=71.24s)]
*  Secure the borders. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=72.14s)]
*  Stop the indoctrination of our children [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=73.44s)]
*  and bring jobs back to this country it used to be. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=75.36s)]
*  You could support a family on one good wage. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=79.38s)]
*  You can't do that anymore in this country [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=82.9s)]
*  because of the ruinous trade policies [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=84.5s)]
*  that unfortunately both parties have supported. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=86.38s)]
*  That has got to come to an end. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=88.96s)]
*  Republicans have got to be the party [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=90.02s)]
*  of working people and working class culture. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=91.8s)]
*  That's what we're fighting for. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=94.92s)]
*  Yeah, Senator Hawley, I think when we look at [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=97.66s)]
*  how many people didn't even show up to vote [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  at all on this last election day, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=101.96s)]
*  I think that alone sends a really strong message [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=104.16s)]
*  that we're not hearing any of the pundits address, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=106.2s)]
*  which is people don't have trust [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=108.6s)]
*  that they actually have public servants there in Washington. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=110.88s)]
*  We're fighting for them, not for the party, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=113.64s)]
*  but for them to address some of these challenges [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=115.6s)]
*  that you're talking about. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. If you look at who didn't show up, Tulsi, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=120.24s)]
*  you've got independents who don't like Joe Biden. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=122.22s)]
*  And they voted for President Obama back in the day. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=125.14s)]
*  They voted for President Trump, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=127.44s)]
*  but they looked at the options this year [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  and they're like, nah, I don't like Biden at all. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't like the Democrats, but I don't trust the Republicans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=131.72s)]
*  Why? Because the Republicans weren't offering anything. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=134.12s)]
*  They weren't saying we're going to secure the border. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  They weren't saying we're going to put cops on the street. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=138.8s)]
*  We've got to go out there and make that case. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=140.92s)]
*  We need new leadership in the Republican party [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=142.8s)]
*  in Washington. This is why I will not support [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=144.72s)]
*  Mitch McConnell for later. We need new leadership, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=147.05999999999997s)]
*  but we also need real convictions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=149.5s)]
*  That's what we've got to be about going forward. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=152.14s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us, Senator Hawley. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPDi_gGuQg&t=157.29999999999998s)]
