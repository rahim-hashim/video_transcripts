# Tucker: What you’re seeing is Washington’s new religion
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM)
*  If you'd asked Anthony Fauci 60 years ago, when he was a student at Holy Cross in Massachusetts, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=0.0s)]
*  whether he would grow up to single-handedly control how Christians celebrate their most [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=6.0s)]
*  beloved holiday, Fauci probably would have assumed you were high, smoking that tea with the beatniks [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=10.32s)]
*  in Greenwich Village, reefer madness. He would have been confused. At the time, Fauci was studying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=15.92s)]
*  to become a doctor, not the pope. And there was a difference then. Little could he have known back [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=21.28s)]
*  in 1958 that public health would become America's reigning religion and he its high priest. But life [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=26.88s)]
*  is like that. You never know where you're going to end up. Fast forward to the beginning of last [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=34.32s)]
*  December. Anthony Fauci was 79 years old. His 80th birthday, it turns out, was Christmas Eve, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=38.72s)]
*  and Fauci was determined to celebrate it with an exhibition of authority flexing that had no precedent [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=44.56s)]
*  in the entire history of the federal bureaucracy. No one had ever done it before, but Fauci did. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=50.8s)]
*  He decided to unilaterally end Christmas. And so, one day on NBC News, he did just that. Watch. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=55.6s)]
*  A warning and a plea from Dr. Anthony Fauci. Should people now cancel their travel plans for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=63.44s)]
*  Christmas? To the extent possible, don't travel, don't congregate together. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=69.12s)]
*  There was. Do not travel for Christmas, Anthony Fauci said. Do not congregate together to celebrate [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  it. That means no Christmas Eve in church. That means no Christmas morning under the tree with [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=81.2s)]
*  your family tearing through stockings. It means no Christmas at all. Sacred Christian observance [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  canceled until further notice from Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. What a thrill it must have been for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=91.36s)]
*  him to say something like that. Here's a guy who fully expected to spend his life giving prostate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=97.84s)]
*  exams. And there he was declaring the ancient Christian calendar null and void. Pretty amazing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=103.2s)]
*  But even more amazing was the reaction that Fauci received when he said it. The people in charge [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=110.88s)]
*  loved it. They never cared much for Christmas anyway. All that religious talk and unsupervised [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=116.64s)]
*  family time, it faintly seemed like a threat. Anthony Fauci, by contrast, was no threat at all [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  to the people in charge. He worked for them. His job was to do their bidding, to confirm their biases, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=127.28s)]
*  and to never, ever challenge their sense of their own moral superiority. Their job in return was to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=133.44s)]
*  love him for it. And they did. Drive through affluent neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=140.16s)]
*  this day and you will see the signs in people's front yards. Honk for Dr. Fauci. In Dr. Fauci we [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=145.44s)]
*  trust. And above all, thank you Tony Fauci. And they really do want to thank him. Not for funding [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  the gain of function research in Wuhan that created COVID. No, it's bigger than that. They're [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=157.6s)]
*  thanking Dr. Fauci for the gift of life which he alone bestows. What you're seeing here is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=162.32s)]
*  Washington's new religion. It's Fauciism. So it shouldn't surprise you that this year once again [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=168.96s)]
*  our more leaders are asking Dr. Fauci the very same question. Christmas is coming. Can we celebrate [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=174.72s)]
*  it? Before we go through the hassle of booking plane tickets, renting cars, buying presents for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=179.68s)]
*  our loved ones, preparing to celebrate the central holiday of the country's biggest religion, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  please let us know Dr. Fauci. Is it on or off? Have we been naughty or nice? Tell us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=189.44s)]
*  This year the job of asking that question fell to an anchor at CBS News and this Sunday she asked Dr. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  Fauci. Here's what he said. But we can gather for Christmas or it's just too soon to tell? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=200.88s)]
*  You know, Margaret, it's just too soon to tell. We've just got to concentrate on continuing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=208.0s)]
*  to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  what we're going to do at a particular time. It really depends on how you behave. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=218.4s)]
*  Whether you're naughty or nice. At this point it's just too soon to tell whether you can have [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=224.24s)]
*  Christmas this year. And in hearing that the news lady just nods. Of course it's all perfectly [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  normal. We'll check back with you Dr. Fauci. Keep doing science as only you can. And of course that's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  exactly what Tony Fauci plans to do. It's what he's done with his life. Last week Fauci had to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=237.68s)]
*  unravel this scientific puzzle. Are the hundreds of thousands of sneezing unvaccinated illegal [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  immigrants coming into this country every month driving a spike in COVID cases? Could that be [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=248.08s)]
*  happening? Figuring that out was Anthony Fauci's job as a scientist. Fauci's scientific conclusion? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=252.72s)]
*  Well here it is. Are immigrants a major reason why COVID-19 is spreading in the U.S.? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=260.16s)]
*  No, absolutely not, Dan. I mean if you just look at the data and look at the people who've gotten [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=268.72s)]
*  infected, look at the people who are in the hospital, look at the people who've died. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=273.6s)]
*  This is not driven by immigrants. What? Fashionable people getting COVID? No, absolutely not, Dan. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=278.4s)]
*  The sneezing unvaccinated migrants streaming across our southern border from around the world [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=287.12s)]
*  are absolutely fine. In fact from a public health perspective they're great people like BLM rioters, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=291.28s)]
*  but very much unlike Donald Trump voters. In fact these people may be the solution to this pandemic. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  If we're going to beat this COVID thing we're going to need a few hundred thousand more people [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=303.52s)]
*  from Haiti. ASAP. They know a thing or two about public health. Thanks Dr. Fauci. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=306.88s)]
*  Meanwhile other non-religious data tell a somewhat different story. The latest figures from immigration [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=312.96s)]
*  officials show that fully 18 percent of illegal migrants leaving border patrol custody have tested [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=318.8s)]
*  positive for COVID. That doesn't even include the unknown but very large numbers who never wound up [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=324.4s)]
*  in border patrol custody. More than 25 percent of migrants who are quote recently scheduled for some [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=330.0s)]
*  expedited deportation flights have tested positive for COVID. What percentage of these people are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=335.44s)]
*  vaccinated? None. But let's face reality here Fauci said. None of that's a problem. The real [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=340.4s)]
*  problem is you and your silly demands to see your family for Christmas or to be with your aging [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=348.0s)]
*  parents as they die in the hospital. That's the problem and how you vote. Our public health [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=354.48s)]
*  establishment strongly agrees with this. As Tony Fauci spoke the CDC rolled out new guidance to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=360.16s)]
*  match. They cautioned that people should hold quote virtual holiday celebrations or have socially [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=365.68s)]
*  distant celebrations outdoors at the end of December. We're doing all this keep in mind for [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=371.92s)]
*  a virus with a median age of death that is higher than life expectancy in the United States and also [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=378.56s)]
*  in the United Kingdom. What that sink in. In the state of Ohio for example where the life expectancy [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  is 73 the median age of death from COVID is 79. That's just public health. But here's the funny [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=388.72s)]
*  thing. Not everyone wanted to hear that we need to cancel Christmas. It turns out outside of network [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=396.72s)]
*  newsrooms Christmas remains stubbornly popular in this country and if there's one thing Tony Fauci [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=402.8s)]
*  responds to it's public opinion. Now Fauci is on television nearly constantly not simply because [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=408.56s)]
*  he's brilliant and an amazing talker and not at all because he's totally self-absorbed and loves [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=413.76s)]
*  to hear himself speak but because it's his job as a public health official. And so he responded this way. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=419.12s)]
*  That was misinterpreted as my saying we can't spend Christmas with our families which was [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=425.68s)]
*  absolutely not the case. I will be spending Christmas with my family. I encourage people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  particularly the vaccinated people who are protected to have a good normal Christmas [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=438.16s)]
*  with your family. But it just the way all of the other disinformation goes around. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=444.0s)]
*  You say something talking about a landmark of a time and it gets misinterpreted that I'm saying [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=448.32000000000005s)]
*  you can't spend family Christmas time which is nonsense. So when I said it's too soon to tell [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=454.72s)]
*  whether or not you can celebrate Christmas what I really meant was of course you can celebrate [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=462.88s)]
*  Christmas. What are you stupid? So Tony Fauci didn't misspeak. You're an idiot for misunderstanding [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=468.24s)]
*  what he said. You're being very naughty. Now this is a strategy Tony Fauci has employed before. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=476.48s)]
*  Just a year ago Fauci told us that quote herd immunity would eventually end the pandemic once [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=484.88s)]
*  60 to 70 percent of Americans are either vaccinated or develop natural immunity. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=489.68s)]
*  Fauci told us we'd be done. We'd be safe. And then out of nowhere the slogans on the side of the barn [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=494.0s)]
*  got repainted but no one acknowledged it. Fauci started quoting a higher number in television [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=500.16s)]
*  interviews. He started saying 70 to 75 percent of people with immunity at that point will be good. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=504.88s)]
*  And then the number rose again. Fauci changed it to quote 80, 85 percent. Now in December a reporter [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  at the New York Times, their job is to report the news, noticed this and asked Fauci about the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=519.12s)]
*  changing numbers. According to the paper quote in a telephone interview Fauci acknowledged that he [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=524.96s)]
*  had slowly but deliberately been moving the goalpost. He is doing so he said partly based on new [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=529.68s)]
*  science but partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=538.8s)]
*  thinks. Oh now he's telling us what he really think. We weren't ready for it before. We just [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=544.96s)]
*  weren't prepared for the truth. But as we grow in our faith Fauci can lay more profundities on us. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=552.4000000000001s)]
*  So yes he was lying but it's only because you can't handle the truth. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  And the media agree with that completely. They've been repeating that message for months now. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=566.96s)]
*  So Dr. Anthony Fauci the target of an escalating right wing smear campaign. The scientists should [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  not be under siege like this. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley have all taken up Dr. Fauci [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=576.48s)]
*  as a boogeyman. The increasing demonization of Dr. Fauci by Donald Trump and his minions in the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=583.44s)]
*  Republican Party is growing. It's obsessive. And watch what they're doing to Tony Fauci right now [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=588.6400000000001s)]
*  because he is the new Hillary Clinton for them. They are making him the piñata of all of their [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=596.64s)]
*  disaffection and their upset. In one America Dr. Anthony Fauci is trusted and even immortalized. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=601.68s)]
*  In the other America though he is tarnished and distrusted. How did Dr. Fauci of all people [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  become a right wing boogeyman? Here's what they're doing on Fox News to make Tony Fauci into a right [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=616.72s)]
*  wing boogeyman. Here's how he's the subject of a right wing smear campaign. What they're doing [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=623.52s)]
*  is they're quoting him. Okay and they're comparing his quotes from yesterday to his quotes from three [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  months ago to his quotes from a year ago and they're noting that they don't all add up. That's a smear [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=633.68s)]
*  campaign. But as CNN's media analyst pointed out in half of America Tony Fauci is immortalized and [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_pAoy6oOM&t=639.84s)]
