# Mayra Flores: The Democratic Party took us for granted
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw)
*  Democratic Party's coalition is exploding at the moment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Biden's support among Hispanics [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=4.66s)]
*  is the lowest among any ethnic group in the United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=6.18s)]
*  Who saw that coming? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=9.98s)]
*  And the effects of it are demonstrable. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=11.98s)]
*  So just the other day, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  a special election took place in the Rio Grande Valley [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=17.22s)]
*  in Texas. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=19.88s)]
*  Mayra Flores, a Republican, flipped a congressional seat [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=21.72s)]
*  that Democrats have held for over a century. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  It's really an amazing story. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=27.62s)]
*  She joins us for her first interview [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  since being sworn in as a member of Congress. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=30.72s)]
*  Congresswoman Flores, I really appreciate your coming on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=32.64s)]
*  Thank you so much. Thank you so much. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  Congratulations on your win. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=35.68s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=37.32s)]
*  What does it mean exactly? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=38.16s)]
*  How did you do this? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=39.16s)]
*  It would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=40.56s)]
*  Honestly, I just focus on the issues [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  that really mattered to my district. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=45.34s)]
*  And we're all about faith, family, and hard work. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=47.54s)]
*  That's exactly who we are. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  And so, yeah, but I mean, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=53.4s)]
*  it was an overwhelmingly Democratic district. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=55.18s)]
*  Yeah, but we didn't have the funding before. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=58.86s)]
*  We didn't have the funding before [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=62.14s)]
*  to get the message across our district. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=63.62s)]
*  And now we do have the funding [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=65.64s)]
*  and the support from the Republican Party. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=67.3s)]
*  But prior to 2020, we did not have that support. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=69.5s)]
*  We were all alone. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  The Democrat Party took us for granted, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=74.06s)]
*  and we also did not have the support [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=75.94s)]
*  from the Republican Party. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=77.46s)]
*  And that's a fact. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=78.42s)]
*  Yeah, nobody thought it was possible. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=81.38s)]
*  No, that was possible. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=83.17999999999999s)]
*  In Washington. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=84.44s)]
*  So faith, family, hard work. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=85.8s)]
*  Yes, that's who we are. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  That's who we've always been. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=90.32s)]
*  People tell me, Mayra, why are you Republican? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Weren't you born in Mexico? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=94.72s)]
*  Well, because I was born in Mexico [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=95.96s)]
*  is that I am Republican, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=98.28s)]
*  because I was raised with strong conservative values, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=99.52s)]
*  and I'm not willing to put them aside for a political party. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=101.72s)]
*  And I'm not loyal to a party. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=105.08s)]
*  I'm loyal to God. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=106.94s)]
*  I'm loyal to my family. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=107.84s)]
*  I'm loyal to my community. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=108.92s)]
*  And I tell the people in South Texas, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=110.28s)]
*  who are you loyal to? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=112.32s)]
*  Are you loyal to God, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=113.68s)]
*  or are you loyal to the Democrat Party? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  And they tell me, no, I'm loyal to God. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  Okay, well, let's stop being loyal to a party [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  who's done nothing for us for over 100 years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=120.34s)]
*  I don't think you're allowed to say I'm loyal to God [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  now that you're in Washington. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  Are you gonna keep saying that? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=128.76000000000002s)]
*  My loyalty is to God and my family. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=132.46s)]
*  God first, all the way. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  That's why I won, because of him, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  because I live in prayer every single day. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=137.3s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=141.22s)]
*  I just love this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=142.76s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=144.6s)]
*  Good luck in Washington. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=145.72s)]
*  I hope you enjoy it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=147.2s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  They're gonna make you try and stop saying that, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=149.6s)]
*  but I hope you'll continue. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=151.6s)]
*  Mayor Flores. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=152.68s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clm1uy7oRUw&t=153.52s)]
