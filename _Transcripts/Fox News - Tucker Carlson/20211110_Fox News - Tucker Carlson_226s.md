# Judge Jeanine predicts Rittenhouse trial outcome
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4)
*  Judge Jeanine Pirro is the host, of course, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=0.0s)]
*  of Justice with Judge Jeanine. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=2.24s)]
*  She joins us tonight with her reaction to the trial. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=3.84s)]
*  Judge, thanks a lot for coming on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=6.18s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=7.32s)]
*  Well, I think that along with your last guest, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=8.8s)]
*  JD Vance, what we're seeing here is the politicization [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=11.96s)]
*  of the criminal justice system. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=15.08s)]
*  This is a case where clearly self-defense [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=17.12s)]
*  is something that will exonerate Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=21.04s)]
*  And whether this case goes to the jury [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=24.52s)]
*  or whether the judge dismisses some of the charges [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  on his own or whether the judge grants a mistrial, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=29.58s)]
*  this young man will be acquitted and exonerated. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=32.7s)]
*  What has happened here is there was a rush [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=36.98s)]
*  to judgment in this case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=39.54s)]
*  This kid who was a fire cadet, a lifeguard, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=41.42s)]
*  and a police explorer, he was a kid who went there [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  to clean graffiti, they have video of it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=48.92s)]
*  He went there to help people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=51.66s)]
*  He was a medic, he was CPR trained. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=53.06s)]
*  And he finds himself in this situation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  He's got a gun and in every circumstance, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=57.86s)]
*  he is, and it's corroborated by what the witnesses say. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=60.86s)]
*  The prosecution star witness, the one who isn't dead, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=64.82s)]
*  basically said, yes, I was lunging at him [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=68.56s)]
*  and I had a loaded gun and I was aiming at him. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=70.86s)]
*  I mean, they established the case right there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=73.66s)]
*  As a judge, I would say, hey, come up to the sidebar here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=75.62s)]
*  What are we doing here, guys? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=78.74s)]
*  But what you had was a rush to judgment in August of 2020. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  We are in the post George Floyd world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Jacob Blake had just been shot. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=87.66s)]
*  Everybody wanted to make sure that, you know, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=90.14s)]
*  that everyone was prosecuted. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=92.86s)]
*  This kid was prosecuted when the evidence was clear [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=94.86s)]
*  that he was defending himself. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=97.96s)]
*  Now, once the burden of proof has shifted, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  once he claims self-defense, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=104.38s)]
*  the prosecution has to disprove that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=106.58s)]
*  beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  That's why the prosecution is desperate right now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=110.82s)]
*  They're on the ropes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  The reason they're on the ropes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=114.69999999999999s)]
*  is they cannot disprove beyond a reasonable doubt [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=116.06s)]
*  based on the drone, the video, the testimony, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=118.78s)]
*  the prosecution star witness, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=122.62s)]
*  and the incredibly focused testimony of this young man. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=124.66s)]
*  He may only be 18, but I'll tell you, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=129.22s)]
*  in all the years I prosecuted myself [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  and tried cases as a judge, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=133.38s)]
*  this kid in every point never lost his cool. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=135.46s)]
*  Sure, he cried. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=139.02s)]
*  He never got angry. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=139.96s)]
*  He said, all I wanted to do was stop the threat. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=141.38s)]
*  I wasn't interested in killing people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=143.94s)]
*  It was not my intent. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=146.54s)]
*  He knew what he was doing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=147.98s)]
*  He knew how to handle a gun. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=149.66s)]
*  And the whole course of the, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=151.34s)]
*  the whole force of the justice system, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  from the president on down to the mainstream media, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=155.02s)]
*  calling him a vigilante, a white supremacist, a militia man. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=158.34s)]
*  I mean, this is what happens in our society [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=162.94s)]
*  when police are told to stand down, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=166.02s)]
*  when no one is there to protect businesses. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=168.34s)]
*  Police were nowhere around there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=170.7s)]
*  This guy Rosenbaum, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=172.18s)]
*  you had his number, Tucker. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  He was someone who was looking for trouble. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=175.5s)]
*  He was, they were yelling cranium him, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=177.82s)]
*  but you mean shoot him in the head. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=180.26s)]
*  They were chasing him. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=181.94s)]
*  They were trying to kill him with a skateboard. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=182.94s)]
*  And the prosecution saying, oh, kill you with a skateboard. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  That deserves lethal force. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  Sure does. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=190.14s)]
*  When you hold it like a baseball bat [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=191.17999999999998s)]
*  and you hit me in the head with it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=194.72s)]
*  Why this case went forward? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=196.14s)]
*  Why there wasn't a plea bargain of some sort? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=197.98s)]
*  But this will end up, I think, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=200.9s)]
*  in good thing for Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=202.78s)]
*  Hope so. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=206.1s)]
*  Yeah, the convicted child molesters [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=207.38s)]
*  out of the mental hospital. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=209.26s)]
*  That's who they're defending. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=210.22s)]
*  Judge Jean, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=211.26s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-byjv0th4&t=213.26s)]
