# Enes Kanter Freedom responds to audio of NBA officials appearing to admit Chinese influence
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo)
*  And his cancer freedom was raised in Turkey, moved to the US as a teenager, then became an NBA player. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=0.0s)]
*  Then he began openly criticizing the Chinese government. He wore shoes that said, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=7.0s)]
*  Free Tibet, which China occupies, and he wore them on the court. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=12.0s)]
*  So normally the NBA encourages political messages. They even wrote BLM on the court. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=16.0s)]
*  But criticizing China is absolutely unacceptable to the sleazeballs who run the NBA. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=22.0s)]
*  This show has obtained exclusive recordings proving what's going on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=27.0s)]
*  Here's Ron Klempner, who's the general counsel of the National Basketball Players Association. Listen. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=31.0s)]
*  And what he was saying, of course, was critical of China. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=58.0s)]
*  Mark Lazary, a close friend of Bill Clinton's, now co-owns the Milwaukee Bucks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=61.0s)]
*  Lazary explained in another recording that China will not do business with the NBA if athletes criticize China in any way. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=66.0s)]
*  And the NBA makes billions of dollars in China. So Mark Lazary obeys. Listen. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=73.0s)]
*  Get it? There's nothing in this business. So their view is, look, you want to be in our country, you want to do things, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=87.0s)]
*  if you're going to complain about us, you're not allowed. So what happens for the NBA is the NBA's in a box. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=92.0s)]
*  It's business. It's business. Yeah, I'll sell out our country to our main global enemy that seeks to displace us and control us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=99.0s)]
*  It's just business beneath contempt. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=109.0s)]
*  Then there's Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner. He acknowledged that, quote, the free Tibet shoes don't break rules, but they upset China. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=112.0s)]
*  And once again, that's bad for business. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=118.0s)]
*  It's just business. So what wouldn't they do? Sell drugs to children? I mean, like what? Human trafficking? It's just business. No problem. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=133.0s)]
*  Ennis Friedman has a problem with all of this. He joins us tonight. Ennis, it's great to see you. I appreciate your coming back. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=142.0s)]
*  So they just say it out loud, like whatever makes them rich, including selling out to the Chinese government, pretending China is not occupying Tibet. No problem. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=149.0s)]
*  First of all, thank you for having me, Mr. Carlson. I mean, Krupp, the NBA is finally got exposed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=161.0s)]
*  And this is the evidence of how 100 percent American made company is run by the Chinese dictatorship. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=166.0s)]
*  And wake up America. This is the league that you have been supporting and watching. And enough is enough. And this is unacceptable. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=174.0s)]
*  They are mad because finally someone from the inside that I played 11 years in this league finally exposed them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=181.0s)]
*  And I'm saying it again. Enough is enough. Stop bowing down to dictatorships. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=188.0s)]
*  That's right. And it's the only American sport is invented at a YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=192.0s)]
*  What about what about all the woke sports writers who are constantly on the lookout for someone saying the wrong thing as any? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=197.0s)]
*  Have any of them taken your side in this? Well, I would just say it is, you know, when I started to talk about this problems for the first time, one of the actually plays reached out to me and said, listen, there's no one going to be behind you, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=204.0s)]
*  especially the media, because they are run by the NBA. So do not have any any hope by the sports media. What? You know, I didn't. You know what? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=220.0s)]
*  This was the right thing to do. And I went out there and exposed it all. So I'm glad I did it. Trust me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=228.0s)]
*  Yeah. Where's Bill Simmons? He's a deeply good person. So we just got this statement from the NBA about one of the recordings. And I want to read it to you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=234.0s)]
*  Quote, Adam Silver made it clear that we support players, including Mr. Freedom, expressing their views on matters that are important to them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=241.0s)]
*  End quote. How do you respond to that disingenuous statement? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=248.0s)]
*  Well, well, the recording said something different. You know, I'm just it just sad to see how these people still can lie to American people. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=253.0s)]
*  How can they bow down to these dictatorships? They will care about social justice until it affects their money and business. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=262.0s)]
*  You know, NBA pretends to care about social justice in America. But when that affects their business, they're silent. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=270.0s)]
*  And if any player that goes out there says anything about it, they're going to do everything they can to silence you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=278.0s)]
*  Look, listen, I'm 30 years old and they're pushing me to retire of age of 30 and I am not retiring. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=284.0s)]
*  I'm going to fight till the that I get come get back to that league again and keep exposing them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=289.0s)]
*  And that's why I just can't take this anymore. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=295.0s)]
*  We're rooting for you and it's freedom. Great to see you. Thank you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8iiKfwqPo&t=299.0s)]
