# Biden an accomplice to Jussie Smollet's race hoax: Will Cain
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc)
*  Well, we want to remind you, because we hate to forget things, and history matters, that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=0.0s)]
*  when this fake hate crime first happened, air quotes, Joe Biden, who was running for the presidency [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  at the time, tweeted this, quote, what happened today to Jussie Smollett must never be tolerated [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=12.32s)]
*  in this country. We are with you, Jussie. The question is, is the President of the United [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  States still with Jussie? Will he amend that tweet? Hmm. In the meantime, for a recap on what we just [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=22.8s)]
*  saw, Will Cain, he's co-host of Fox and Friends Weekend, he's also, what's the phrase, an eminent [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=29.6s)]
*  lawyer, and we're really happy to have him with us tonight. Will, thanks so much for coming on. So [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=35.36s)]
*  what do you make of this? What have we learned? Well, unfortunately, I don't think you've called [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=38.72s)]
*  me in for any great legal analysis of the Commerce Clause or how it's been tortured for federal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=42.24s)]
*  power. You've more called me in to analyze my cousin Vinny. It's not to kill a mockingbird. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  This is a comedy. This is a comedy. Good point. And it's more, it's less about the law and it's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=50.8s)]
*  more about narcissism. You know, if there is an intersection, Tucker, it's that Jussie decided to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=56.16s)]
*  take the stand, which is shocking. I guess it's shocking, but he's been performing his way through [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=61.12s)]
*  life. He's been performing his way into and out of success. And he sat in front of Robin Roberts [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=65.84s)]
*  and put on an amazing performance for GMA. So I guess he thought he could put on a performance [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=71.12s)]
*  for a jury. But what we found out is that juries across America, several times now over the last [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=75.44s)]
*  several months, have proven to be more intelligent and more just than studios in television [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=81.84s)]
*  studios in New York City. And I think we've seen that with Jussie Smollett, with Kyle Rittenhouse, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  and with Ahmaud Arbery. Trust the American justice system. That is such a wise point. And your [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=91.84s)]
*  original point that this is about narcissism as virtually everything bad in this whole moment [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  is about narcissism. Will you expand on that a little bit? Yeah, I think everybody in this entire [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=103.12s)]
*  melodrama is playing for their own benefit. So let's go back to Joe Biden. Joe Biden, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=108.8s)]
*  the American media Kamala Harris, they're not marks. They weren't conned. They weren't duped. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=113.44s)]
*  In my mind, they were accomplices to a race hoax with Jussie Smollett. Smollett's incentives were [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=118.24s)]
*  clear. He could only achieve so much fame by starring in Empire. He played to the incentive [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=124.24s)]
*  of America, which is to be the victim of a race crime puts you on the highest pedestal. But look, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=129.44s)]
*  so did Joe Biden, the American media. They played into something that confirmed their worldview [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=134.72s)]
*  and their role as heroes in this racist country. They played it for their own benefit. So, and by [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=139.6s)]
*  the way, both were perfectly willing to sacrifice the victims of real race crimes. They were both [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=146.32s)]
*  perfectly willing to sacrifice tearing this country apart along racial lines for their own benefit, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=151.68s)]
*  for their own validation. Man is that smart. I'm pounding the desk beneath the camera. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=157.52s)]
*  A lot of impressive people come out of Fox and Friend weekend. I'm here to tell you that was so [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=163.2s)]
*  great. Thank you, Will Cain. Good to see you tonight. Thank you. Thanks, man. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkLqUU9Izc&t=168.32s)]
