# Golf legend Greg Norman says 'I really don't care' about LIV Golf criticism
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0)
*  So one of our unbending life rules is don't get involved in things you don't understand. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=0.0s)]
*  Don't take sides in arguments you don't really get. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=7.72s)]
*  But we violate it all the time of course because sometimes something really interesting happens [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=12.96s)]
*  and you just have to kind of wait it and see what it's about. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=16.4s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening in golf right now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=18.6s)]
*  And as we should just say at the outset, we are not taking sides in this, but one of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  biggest controversies in sports in many years is taking place between the PGA Tour and an [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=24.56s)]
*  upstart tour called Live. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=32.36s)]
*  Now we watched this happen, we didn't know exactly what to make of it, but it seemed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=35.12s)]
*  interesting. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Lots of drama in one of America's top sports, a sport with a storied history, so we decided [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  to go to Trump Bedminster, the golf club yesterday in New Jersey, and find out what was happening. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=44.4s)]
*  While there we talked to one of the best golfers in the history of sport, who's now the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Commissioner of Live International, and asked him, why are you doing this exactly? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=54.48s)]
*  That would be Greg Norman, here's part of our conversation with him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=60.48s)]
*  What is the business model? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=65.28s)]
*  I mean you're not signing your players to an exclusivity contract at all, they can play [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=66.56s)]
*  wherever else they want. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=72.6s)]
*  There are no TV rights at this point, you're streaming it for free. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=73.6s)]
*  They're putting a huge amount of money into it, that's obvious just from sitting here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=77.44s)]
*  So how does the revenue arrive? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=81.28s)]
*  Well the revenue will come in once we launch the league, right? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=83.68s)]
*  This year is a start-up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=86.48s)]
*  Because quite honestly back in February when we were ready to start up, there were a few [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=89.48s)]
*  obstacles thrown in our way from the PGA Tour, so we had to pull our reins back a little [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  bit. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=99.72s)]
*  For our viewers who aren't following, can you give us a sense of those obstacles? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=100.72s)]
*  Well that's when the book came out about Phil Mickelson, Phil Mickelson made some not so [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  complimentary remarks about the Saudi, where the money came from, Saudi Arabia, and then [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=109.28s)]
*  the snowballs created a bit of a dominoes or a scary effect and the PGA Tour came in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=114.48s)]
*  and they obviously did the right thing and trying to protect their monopoly came in and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=119.76s)]
*  the players backed off a little bit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=124.76s)]
*  So we had to regroup, we're ready to sign the next week, we're ready to sign multiple [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=127.26s)]
*  players and launch the league. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=131.36s)]
*  So we decided to take a step back, analyze the situation, we knew our model was the way [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=134.04s)]
*  it was, we knew our investor was still there, he wasn't going anywhere, the money was in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  the bank, right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=144.2s)]
*  So we just made an adjustment and we worked around every obstacle that's been thrown in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  our path. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  So we came up with the Invitational Series to beta test this, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=151.6s)]
*  Now with the fans, Tucker, we did a survey for nearly 12 months around the world asking [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=157.28s)]
*  fans from different tours, what are they like and what are they missing? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=164.88s)]
*  And they came up, it was overwhelmingly more fan engagement, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=170.72s)]
*  More fan experiences and team sport. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=176.0s)]
*  Give us more teams. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=180.26s)]
*  And that's we built the model around that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=181.26s)]
*  Now model, Tucker, is 100% built around the golf ecosystem from the ground up. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=183.46s)]
*  So we're not trying to destroy the PGA Tour or the European Tour, we're there to work [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=190.82s)]
*  within the ecosystem to show that it's big enough space. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=197.26s)]
*  It's a multi-billion dollar industry, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  Billions and billions of dollars in the game of golf. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=203.78s)]
*  Why would sponsors drop golfers for participating in LIV? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  Tucker, that blows my mind. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=211.34s)]
*  And sponsors, by the way, who spend billions of dollars in Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=213.58s)]
*  The PGA Tour. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=217.9s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  Can you give us examples? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  I'll give you a prime example. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  The PGA Tour, I think has about 27 sponsors on the PGA Tour, do 40 plus billion dollars [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=223.86s)]
*  worth of business on an annual basis in Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  Now why doesn't the PGA Tour call the CEOs of each one of those organizations? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=236.06s)]
*  Sorry, we can't do business with you because you're doing business with Saudi Arabia? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=240.62s)]
*  Why are they picking on the professional golfers? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=247.98s)]
*  The male professional golfers? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=248.98s)]
*  Females, the LPGA Tour is sponsored by Aramco. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  Literally? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  Literally. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  The largest sponsor of women's golf in the world is Aramco. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=256.58s)]
*  Not one word has been said about them, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=262.18s)]
*  But why is it on the guys? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  Why are we the yogas? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=267.3s)]
*  What have we done wrong? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=268.78s)]
*  They're independent contractors. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=270.5s)]
*  We have a right to go play wherever we want in the world for whatever we want. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=272.22s)]
*  So what do you think that's about? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=276.3s)]
*  It's clearly not about principle, obviously. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=277.3s)]
*  So what is it about? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=279.38s)]
*  It's a monopoly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=280.38s)]
*  They just want to shut us down whatever way they can, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=281.38s)]
*  So they'll use whatever leverage point they can to shut us down. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=284.22s)]
*  And they're not. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=287.82s)]
*  They're not going to shut us down because the product's speaking for itself. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=288.82s)]
*  We have my phone almost on a daily basis. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=292.5s)]
*  It gets calls every day from players, one in, I want in. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=298.02s)]
*  Can I join Liv? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=301.06s)]
*  I tell them, I'm sorry, the shop is closed. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=302.98s)]
*  So the list gets longer and longer and longer for the players who want to come in. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=306.02s)]
*  Which again, it's a testament to the right white noise. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=309.7s)]
*  Why is it so offensive to some American golf fans that you're doing this? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=314.66s)]
*  What are they mad about? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=320.26s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=321.26s)]
*  I really don't care, quite honestly. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=323.02s)]
*  I just love the game of golf so much and I just want to grow the game of golf. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=324.02s)]
*  And we at Liv see that opportunity. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=327.9s)]
*  We at Liv see it not just for the men, but for the women. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=330.14s)]
*  We at Liv see it for NCAA and younger generations. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=332.82s)]
*  We at Liv see it as a pathway to opportunities for these kids to experience a new world out [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=336.42s)]
*  there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  Liv is the future of golf. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's in more, it's just, that's a very simple phrase and comment. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  Liv is the future of golf because you don't see what we see in the future. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=350.62s)]
*  You don't see what we want to invest in the future. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=355.58s)]
*  CSR programs, education programs, all this stuff that's out there that we want to get [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=357.9s)]
*  involved with for golf and growing the game of golf. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=363.46s)]
*  So you keep reading that you offered Tiger Woods $700, $800 billion, some unknown number [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=366.53999999999996s)]
*  to join Liv. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  That number was out there before I became CEO. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=375.34s)]
*  So that number's been out there, yes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=378.74s)]
*  And look, Tiger's a needle mover, right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=380.98s)]
*  So of course you got to look at the best of the best. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=384.3s)]
*  So they had originally approached Tiger before I became CEO. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=387.26s)]
*  So yes, that number is somewhere in that neighborhood. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=391.90000000000003s)]
*  Big number. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=396.42s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=397.42s)]
*  I would say, call me small time. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=399.94s)]
*  What's Donald Trump's connection? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=402.38s)]
*  He seems like a supporter. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=404.26s)]
*  We haven't talked to him about it, but he, I mean, we're at his golf club right now. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=405.26s)]
*  I've known Donald for a long time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=408.7s)]
*  I played golf with him before he was president. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=410.29999999999995s)]
*  And I've done golf courses that he's bought, he's acquired, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=413.62s)]
*  So his passion for the game of golf is as passionate as he's been a president, where [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=418.58s)]
*  stars and stripes flow through his blood, right? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=424.21999999999997s)]
*  Same with golf. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=428.26s)]
*  He loves his golf. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=429.26s)]
*  And he sees the commercial opportunity of what golf can give him, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=430.26s)]
*  Trump-Bedminster is no different, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=435.17999999999995s)]
*  His golf club membership here is full. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=437.02000000000004s)]
*  It's a commercial entity for him. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=439.42s)]
*  It's an operation where he can make some revenue out of it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=440.78000000000003s)]
*  So when we first started, obviously as the startup, we needed venues. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=444.22s)]
*  He had heard about it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=449.18s)]
*  We were in discussions with him and we just negotiated a venue fee with him here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=451.18s)]
*  And he loved it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=457.70000000000005s)]
*  And he's now, this week, he's just been in the background, but in the foreground, if [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=458.70000000000005s)]
*  you know what I mean. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=463.26s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=464.26s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=465.26s)]
*  He's been in the background this week. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  He doesn't, he's not putting himself out in front of Liv. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=467.53999999999996s)]
*  He's embraced it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=471.53999999999996s)]
*  He walks to the first tee. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=473.53999999999996s)]
*  He allows Liv to breathe, which I think is fantastic. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  And I've been with him every day and it's an opportunity for us because they're great [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  venues. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=484.18s)]
*  The players love this place. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=485.18s)]
*  It's a great opportunity for us to showcase. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=486.86s)]
*  I just went up there and I would just walk through with 600 members through in the member [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=489.58s)]
*  section of the clubhouse. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=494.9s)]
*  And you cannot believe the thank yous and the energy and appreciate what you've done [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=496.85999999999996s)]
*  here for this organization. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=504.46s)]
*  I've never seen our boss so happy. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=505.78s)]
*  You know, golf is this and you've done this for Bedminster and we really, really do thank [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=507.7s)]
*  you for it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=512.86s)]
*  It's just incredible. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=514.34s)]
*  I mean, from a CEO, Commissioner standpoint, it's exhausting sometimes to go around 600 [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=515.34s)]
*  people and do that, but it's so rewarding to hear the feedback from it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=523.34s)]
*  It actually re-energizes me. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=528.34s)]
*  And so I just did that before coming to see you. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=530.22s)]
*  Rick Norman, thank you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BEU-cTjly0&t=533.6600000000001s)]
