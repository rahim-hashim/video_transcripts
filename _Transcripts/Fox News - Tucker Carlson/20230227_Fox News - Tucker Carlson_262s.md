# Ron DeSantis: Florida has become the focus point of freedom
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY)
*  Well, here's a trivia fact you may not have known. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=0.0s)]
*  Since 1967, 56 years, the Disney Corporation has enjoyed near total control over about [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=4.12s)]
*  40 square miles of Florida, its own little Vatican City. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=12.16s)]
*  And this is by act of the Florida legislature, which empowered Disney to function effectively [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  as its government. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=19.48s)]
*  Disney could even acquire territory outside its chunk of land by eminent domain. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=20.92s)]
*  Just take it from people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=25.2s)]
*  Now, last year, people began to wonder, why would Disney, which is a totally politicized [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  company that pushes race hate, race hate, and sexualized propaganda on children, why [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=32.36s)]
*  would they have all these special benefits in the state of Florida? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=36.72s)]
*  Hmm, good question. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=38.92s)]
*  So last year, Florida's legislature passed a bill ending this weird little arrangement [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=39.92s)]
*  Disney had. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=44.68s)]
*  Of course, they hated it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=45.68s)]
*  Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis pushed for and then signed that bill into law. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=47.36s)]
*  Governor DeSantis joins us tonight. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=51.4s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=52.4s)]
*  So why did you see this as an important thing to do as the governor? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=54.72s)]
*  Well, as you pointed out, Tucker, I mean, no company or individual in Florida, probably [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=58.0s)]
*  anywhere else in our whole country, has enjoyed their own governing status being exempt from [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=64.36s)]
*  most or many of the laws of the state of Florida, massive subsidies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=71.08s)]
*  So it's not a good arrangement to begin with. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=75.14s)]
*  But if you remember last year, they came out very strong against a piece of legislation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=77.48s)]
*  to protect parents' rights and to protect young children from having sexualized curriculum [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=82.32s)]
*  in things like elementary school. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=87.32s)]
*  And then they had executives talking about it was their intent to jam some of this sexualized [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  programming in the Disney cartoons and programming for young kids. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=95.28s)]
*  So then we're in a situation, Tucker, where they're taking those positions as a company, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  which are antithetical to our values. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=103.96s)]
*  But with this arrangement, Florida was subsidizing that type of activism. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=106.24s)]
*  That could no longer stand. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=111.48s)]
*  And so now today in the state of Florida, for the first time since 1967, Disney no longer [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=113.04s)]
*  has its own government. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=119.12s)]
*  They're going to have to abide by the same laws as everybody else. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  They're going to finally pay their fair share of taxes and pay all the debts that they've [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  racked up over these decades. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=128.56s)]
*  But my understanding was in a democracy, unelected corporate executives get to make your laws [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=130.72s)]
*  for you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=134.8s)]
*  No? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=135.8s)]
*  Well, you know, there's a lot of people in the corporate press that think that that's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  what they would rather have. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=141.28s)]
*  You know, I just won by 1.5 million votes, and then I go and do what I said I would do, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  and they squeal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=147.44s)]
*  They would much rather have Disney running the show in central Florida. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=148.44s)]
*  But there's a new sheriff in town, and I think that this is going to be good for the state [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=151.9s)]
*  of Florida. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=156.08s)]
*  And I'll tell you, Tucker, the people that work there have been very, very thankful that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=157.08s)]
*  we took this action. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=161.96s)]
*  The firefighters, for example, on site, we're so glad that we're finally stepping up, going [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=163.12s)]
*  to listen to them, and going to treat them much better. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=167.8s)]
*  So you just wrote a book about what you've done in Florida called The Courage to Be Free, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=170.24s)]
*  Florida's blueprint, if I can pronounce it, for America's revival. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=174.32s)]
*  It's out tomorrow. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=178.36s)]
*  What's it about? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=179.68s)]
*  Well, people would say, how did you do it in Florida? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=181.0s)]
*  I mean, we've become the focus point of freedom in the United States, and even around the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=184.84s)]
*  world people look at Florida. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  You just had someone from Spain saying, a politician, she wants Spain to be the Florida [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=190.96s)]
*  of Europe. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=195.72s)]
*  And I think what we do is we talk about the different fights that we've had, our approach [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=197.0s)]
*  to leadership. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=200.96s)]
*  But at the end of the day, Tucker, you talk about it all the time on your show. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  Yes, we got a fight over weaning government, very important, and we have a very vast administrative [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=205.52s)]
*  state that we battle with Biden. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=211.88s)]
*  But you also have corporate America going woke, big tech censoring. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  So these are fights all across the scene. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  And when you stand up for what's right, they come after you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=220.68s)]
*  It isn't easy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=224.0s)]
*  So you got to have the courage of your convictions to stand strong. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=225.16s)]
*  But I think what we've shown in Florida, if you do that, and people see you're willing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=228.1s)]
*  to fight for them, they'll walk over broken glass barefoot to vote for you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=231.56s)]
*  And I'm proof positive of that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=235.54000000000002s)]
*  Four years ago, I won by 32,000 votes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=237.08s)]
*  Last November, I won by 1.5 million votes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=240.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=243.84s)]
*  Well, movement is the ultimate election. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=244.84s)]
*  People are moving there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=246.88s)]
*  So that kind of tells you, I would say, a lot. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=247.88s)]
*  Governor Ronny Santas of Florida, thank you very much. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGFjEYVPJY&t=249.84s)]
