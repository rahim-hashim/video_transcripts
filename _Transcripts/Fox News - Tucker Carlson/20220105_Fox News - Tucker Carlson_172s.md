# The American experiment is dead if this happens: Stephen Miller
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA)
*  Former White House adviser Stephen Miller is leading the fight against that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=0.0s)]
*  His group is America First Legal. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=3.72s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=4.96s)]
*  Stephen Miller, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=5.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  For being one of the few people to mount a legal challenge to all of this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=8.56s)]
*  So what exactly are you fighting against and why? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=10.8s)]
*  Well let's take New York first. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=14.56s)]
*  So we've all heard the term equity thrown around a lot in recent years. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=16.28s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=19.7s)]
*  Equity means using raw societal power to punish people based on skin color. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=21.16s)]
*  That's what equity is. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=28.04s)]
*  In the context of New York, we are seeing decisions about life and death medical care [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=29.4s)]
*  being made according to race and skin color. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  If this is allowed to survive, if this policy is allowed to endure, then in a very real [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=37.32s)]
*  sense our constitution ceases to be the supreme law of the land and instead becomes the relic [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  of a fallen civilization. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  That's how big the stakes are in this fight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=50.44s)]
*  If you get to the point in this country where healthcare for your loved ones, for your family, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  your grandparents can be decided based on what country their ancestors come from, what [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=58.44s)]
*  they look like, what their skin tone is, the American experiment is dead. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=63.32s)]
*  So we're asking all New Yorkers, all New York doctors who have concerns about this policy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=67.9s)]
*  to go to our website aflegal.org, get in touch with us, help us fight back legally, and we're [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=73.0s)]
*  going to see what we can do here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=78.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this is so grotesque that I have to believe if it were covered, if news organizations [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=80.64s)]
*  reported this was happening, the average person, even the average Biden voter would say, well [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=87.26s)]
*  you can't kill people because that's what they're proposing, withholding life-saving [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=91.62s)]
*  medical care from people because of their skin color. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  That's like everything we're against, isn't it? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=99.38s)]
*  I thought. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=101.14s)]
*  It means unlimited government power, the power of life and death over innocent people because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=102.66s)]
*  of how they look. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=108.74s)]
*  You were talking about fascism. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=110.3s)]
*  There's no other word to describe this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  This is fascism. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=113.9s)]
*  American liberalism, small l. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=115.58s)]
*  It's also racism. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=117.02s)]
*  I mean just to note the obvious, right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=118.02s)]
*  I mean like, yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=120.22s)]
*  It's racist fascism. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=121.62s)]
*  It's using totalitarian power to advance a racist agenda. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=123.3s)]
*  American liberalism, small l, the idea of the individual having innate dignity, innate [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=126.98s)]
*  worth, and innate rights, that's dead. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=132.1s)]
*  That's gone if this is allowed to persist and ultimately spread across our whole healthcare [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=134.7s)]
*  system. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=140.02s)]
*  So that's what's at stake. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=141.02s)]
*  So again, if you're living in New York tonight and you're concerned about how this policy [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=142.02s)]
*  affects your health, affects your family's health, go to aflegal.org where we are going [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=145.0s)]
*  to help you fight back. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=151.24s)]
*  No one else is doing it, so I'm glad that you are. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=155.68s)]
*  Stephen Miller, thanks so much. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1JQTE_9xA&t=157.76s)]
