# Tucker sounds off on Pennsylvania governor over bill dictating sex dialogue
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y)
*  Really from the moment COVID-19 left the lab in Wuhan wafted skyward, politicians in this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  country have been busy awarding themselves these extraordinary new powers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=7.84s)]
*  Now we've chronicled the growing egomania of our political class pretty extensively [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=12.68s)]
*  on this show over the past year and a half. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=17.18s)]
*  At various times we've described these people as authoritarians, even fascists in our hotter [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=19.56s)]
*  moments. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=23.96s)]
*  But in retrospect, language like that turns out to be inadequate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=25.0s)]
*  Those are political terms, so they don't really capture what is essentially a theological [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=28.36s)]
*  phenomenon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=33.12s)]
*  Our leaders are doing things that previous civilizations permitted only their gods to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=34.32s)]
*  do. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=38.84s)]
*  Now the Aztecs may have committed cannibalism and human sacrifice on a mass scale, but in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=39.84s)]
*  their defense they did it in the name of an all-powerful deity, Shepetotech. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=43.96s)]
*  Our leaders don't even bother with the middleman. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  They have no gods. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Our leaders issue edicts in their own name and then expect those edicts to be followed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=53.18s)]
*  as commandments. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=57.36s)]
*  The most recent example of this comes from the state of Pennsylvania and its democratic [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=58.36s)]
*  governor Tom Wolf. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=62.68s)]
*  Now Wolf is a reedy, balding man in his early 70s. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=64.64s)]
*  If you look at him you might think he's a retired middle school Spanish teacher or a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=67.96s)]
*  greeter at Whole Foods. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=71.52s)]
*  Nothing about governor Tom Wolf screams Aztec war god. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=73.28s)]
*  But beneath the cardigan sweater, that is exactly how Wolf sees himself. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=78.0s)]
*  On Monday the governor announced that he is now so powerful that he has the right to determine [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=82.62s)]
*  what his subjects say to one another during sex. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=87.2s)]
*  The exact words. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=90.72s)]
*  Tom Wolf has written dialogue for other people's sex lives. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  And if they fail to read that dialogue precisely, they are guilty of a felony. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=96.4s)]
*  It's a pretty amazing demand when you think about it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=101.56s)]
*  If you're over 30 you probably recall when liberals used to fret about politicians trying [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  to get into our bedrooms. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=108.2s)]
*  At the time it seemed like kind of an overstatement, but not anymore. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  Tom Wolf is already in your bedroom. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  He just barged right in. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=115.88s)]
*  He's staying right there at the dresser watching. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=116.88s)]
*  He plans to supervise every detail. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=119.32s)]
*  On Twitter, Wolf explained that he intends to quote, enact affirmative consent standards [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=122.22s)]
*  for all sexual activity that might take place on college campuses in the state of Pennsylvania. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=127.24s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=132.56s)]
*  Wolf asked rhetorically, quote, we must move from no means no to yes means yes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=133.74s)]
*  Without an affirmative yes, it is sexual assault. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  In other words, read our script or we will charge you with rape. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  In case there's any doubt about what Wolf's law requires, the bill specifically notes [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=148.76s)]
*  that silence does not confer the right to quote, engage in sexual activity. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=153.04s)]
*  You're not allowed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=158.2s)]
*  So going forward, more than 700,000 people in the state of Pennsylvania will be legally [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=160.0s)]
*  required to talk during sex. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  Yes is the word Governor Wolf wants to hear. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=168.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=171.56s)]
*  But to be clear, not yes uttered in some breathy way with your eyes rolled back. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=172.56s)]
*  No. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=176.72s)]
*  Governor Wolf demands to hear yes spoken in a forthright declarative manner as in a deposition. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=177.72s)]
*  So how is the governor ever going to make sure that this actually happens? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=184.76s)]
*  That's really the question. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=188.36s)]
*  Laws without enforcement are mere suggestions. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=189.86s)]
*  But Aztec war gods don't make suggestions. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=192.6s)]
*  They issue decrees. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=195.08s)]
*  So in order for Tom Wolf to verify that kids across Pennsylvania are using Tom Wolf approved [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=196.84s)]
*  language as they roll around naked in their dorm rooms at three in the morning, Tom Wolf [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=201.72s)]
*  is going to need to go farther than any governor ever has. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  He's going to need to see the tapes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=208.72s)]
*  In the name of public safety, Newbile young college girls from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=210.64s)]
*  are going to have to email their homemade naughty videos directly to Governor Wolf himself, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=214.88s)]
*  most likely to his private proton mail address. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=220.27999999999997s)]
*  Just to be certain that this important new law is being followed rigorously. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  Tom Wolf's a busy man. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=227.64s)]
*  He's a governor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=228.64s)]
*  When you're in charge of the intimate personal lives of an entire population, you don't have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=229.64s)]
*  a lot of time left over. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=233.77999999999997s)]
*  But in this case, Governor Wolf will make the time. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=235.77999999999997s)]
*  Governor Wolf will watch these videos, every one of them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=239.32s)]
*  That's his duty. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=242.48s)]
*  And in the age of Corona, it's also his right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=243.48s)]
*  We should let you know that we invited Governor Wolf onto the show tonight. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=246.88s)]
*  We wanted to know which other sexual techniques, positions or safe words he will be mandating [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=250.16s)]
*  in the coming weeks. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=255.04s)]
*  And staff inform us that the governor was indisposed at the moment he was locked in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=256.8s)]
*  his private study watching something intently on his iPhone. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=260.18s)]
*  Pretty creepy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=263.8s)]
*  Let's know if we hear anything from Governor Wolf. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozVumm-qy9Y&t=264.8s)]
