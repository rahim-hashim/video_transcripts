# Civil rights attorney calls on Elon Musk to move Twitter out of San Francisco
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ)
*  Well, it's been a couple of days now, but liberals are still in full hysteria and panic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  over the thought that they might lose their monopoly on speech in this country since Elon [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Musk has bought Twitter. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=9.6s)]
*  Harmeet Dhillon has thought a lot about this, how to fix Twitter's free speech problem. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=11.6s)]
*  She is one of this country's leading civil rights attorneys, CEO of the Center for American [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=15.8s)]
*  Liberty and a frequent guest here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=19.14s)]
*  Harmeet Dhillon, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=21.2s)]
*  So how do you... [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=22.86s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=23.86s)]
*  So this is a... [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=24.86s)]
*  It's actually, if you get into the details, pretty complicated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=25.86s)]
*  How exactly do you fix Twitter's free speech problem? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=27.84s)]
*  Well, first, Elon Musk has in its hands one of the most important, perhaps the most important [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  free speech vehicles in the world right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=36.76s)]
*  And so he has an opportunity to change the discourse in this country for the better. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=39.92s)]
*  And I think there are a few simple things he can do. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=44.0s)]
*  First of all, you got to move Twitter out of San Francisco and out of California altogether. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=45.84s)]
*  One of the big problems in these big tech companies has been how they are overwhelmingly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=51.16s)]
*  And that is what you see in the bias in how these companies moderate speech and content. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  So if he moves it to Florida, to Texas, to frankly any place in America, outside California, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  I think that would be a huge improvement. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=66.56s)]
*  I've seen calls to fire employees. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=70.88s)]
*  I think that's extreme and also has liability issues. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=71.88s)]
*  But I think he could ask people to reapply for the position they want in the company [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=75.84s)]
*  and then see if they're willing to go along with some of these new policies that I'm talking [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=79.72s)]
*  about. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=83.96s)]
*  I think one of the important things that Elon Musk needs to do is let back onto Twitter [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  people who have been banned. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  And there are a lot of people, including clients of my firm. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  Rogan O'Hanley is currently suing Twitter. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  We also represent some meme meisters like Carpe Donkton and Megan Murphy, a feminist, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  a radical Canadian feminist who was kicked off of Twitter for so-called misgendering. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=102.88s)]
*  All of these people, I think bringing them back on would actually increase popularity [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=106.88s)]
*  and traffic on Twitter, which is what a business should want. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=111.04s)]
*  And then I think, you know, just going back to something very simple that we learn as [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=114.96s)]
*  children, to be honest and transparent, that has been tremendously lacking in Twitter. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=118.0s)]
*  Twitter has lied about how it has put its finger on the scale about election interference [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=123.04s)]
*  until after the fact. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=127.32s)]
*  Twitter is not transparent about its policies, its algorithms. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=129.0s)]
*  Twitter is not transparent about how people are removed from the platform. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=133.06s)]
*  Twitter is not transparent, frankly, about who its users are. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=138.11999999999998s)]
*  I think Elon Musk has talked about removing the bots from Twitter. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=141.32s)]
*  I think that would tremendously improve the user experience. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  So there are a lot of complicated issues here at Tucker, and I'm sure he's getting advice [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=147.72s)]
*  from all over the place. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=151.56s)]
*  And of course, I'm suing Twitter. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=152.56s)]
*  So that is certainly a factor in what I have to say here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=153.88s)]
*  But I think if he wants to make a fresh start of this amazing company with tremendous value [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  and potential for free speech, he can do all of these things. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=164.04s)]
*  And the final thing I would say is continue to strike that blow for free speech that he's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=167.08s)]
*  been doing on Twitter for the last few days. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=172.08s)]
*  United States government is coming for Elon Musk. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=174.32s)]
*  They're coming with today's announcement of this disinformation panel that they're going [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=176.72s)]
*  to have to examine so-called disinformation governance panel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=182.0s)]
*  That is really the government trying to impose the censorship that Elon Musk is saying is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=186.8s)]
*  no longer going to exist on Twitter. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  I think we all need to stand together for that and have open and fresh conversations. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=194.12s)]
*  I'm looking forward to being on Twitter for many years, hopefully, with the fresh leadership. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  The panel you talked about is our lead for tomorrow's show, really one of the most brazen [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=202.72s)]
*  assaults in the First Amendment in this century. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=206.76s)]
*  So quite amazing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=209.6s)]
*  Harmeet Dhillon, thank you for that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=210.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=212.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98Qc2MXOKQ&t=223.56s)]
