# Charlie Hurt tells Tucker the media’s narrative about January 6 ‘is truly sick’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs)
*  But first, to assess what we just saw, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=0.0s)]
*  Charlie Hurt of the Washington Times joins us now. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=1.36s)]
*  Charlie, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=3.72s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=5.48s)]
*  So if you think, and you really got a feel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=6.32s)]
*  for Brian Sicknick, who's passed away, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=10.0s)]
*  and you've got to wonder about anyone who knew, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=13.64s)]
*  they knew that he was not murdered by the mob, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=18.32s)]
*  but they've claimed it anyway for two years. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=20.68s)]
*  And it takes a very low kind of person to do that, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=23.88s)]
*  to lie about a man's death like that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  for political advantage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=29.04s)]
*  And this tape proves that's exactly what they did. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=30.76s)]
*  No, these people are truly sick. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=33.76s)]
*  You think you know how sick they are, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=37.32s)]
*  and then you see something like this, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=39.68s)]
*  and you realize that there is truly nothing, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=41.08s)]
*  no body, no event, nothing that they won't exploit. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=44.08s)]
*  And as Joe Biden said, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=48.16s)]
*  oh no, this is also about white supremacy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=49.32s)]
*  And nobody comported themselves worse [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=51.28s)]
*  than the press did on this day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=56.8s)]
*  And of course in the years afterwards. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=59.2s)]
*  And the best example of it is to look at the degree [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=60.84s)]
*  to which so many people in the press are so upset [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=64.04s)]
*  that you got the tapes, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=66.08s)]
*  and that you're gonna release the tapes. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=67.48s)]
*  I've never heard of this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=69.12s)]
*  I've never, in all of my life, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=70.52s)]
*  I've never known a press [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=72.28s)]
*  that didn't want information to be released. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=74.6s)]
*  That's what we have been fighting for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=78.16s)]
*  since the invention of the printing press. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=79.76s)]
*  And now we have all these people, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  they're so committed to sort of the big lie [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  that the government tells, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  that they'll do anything, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  including denigrating the name of a good police officer, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  and trying to hide the truth [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=97.72s)]
*  in order to sort of prop up this propaganda. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  And the deadly insurrection is one of them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  The other one that they love to talk about [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=105.2s)]
*  is the armed insurrectionists. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=107.92s)]
*  And I remember at the time, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  asking reporters at the time, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=111.44s)]
*  why do you keep calling these people armed insurrectionists [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=113.56s)]
*  when there's no evidence [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=116.44s)]
*  that anybody used any arms against them? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=117.48s)]
*  And they said, well, they had flagpoles. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=119.36s)]
*  So it's because people were walking around [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  with American flags that made them armed insurrectionists. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=123.64s)]
*  I should say for viewers who don't know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=127.84s)]
*  you've been in journalism all your life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=129.2s)]
*  Your father was a journalist. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=130.96s)]
*  You grew up in this business. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=132.04s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=133.56s)]
*  It's shocking to see how thoroughly it's been perverted [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=134.68s)]
*  into what it is now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=138.08s)]
*  To support the government. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  Active defense of the people in charge. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=142.16s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=143.92s)]
*  Charlie Hurt, appreciate it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. Great to see you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s_2dnJ8tLs&t=146.23999999999998s)]
