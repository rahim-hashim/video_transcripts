# Tucker: Here's why NPR is collapsing
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY)
*  Things seem to be in steep decline over at National Public Radio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=0.0s)]
*  NPR's own media reporter destroyed a lengthy piece explaining that the white supremacy [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=3.72s)]
*  they're so concerned about is coming from inside the house. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=7.32s)]
*  Quote, NPR struggles to retain high-profile journalists of color. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Hosts have complained to the network's leadership of pay disparities along racial and gender [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=15.24s)]
*  lines. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, that sounds systemic and weird considering 99% of NPR's programming is about promoting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  equity. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=26.2s)]
*  So what's going on here? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, to investigate, we listened to many more hours of NPR. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=28.56s)]
*  Here's part of what we heard. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  So diet culture is this overarching system of beliefs and values that's really endemic [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=33.6s)]
*  to Western culture at this point in history. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  Kristi Harrison is an anti-diet registered dietitian with a master's in public health. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=41.28s)]
*  So there was an anti-diet dietitian. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=47.84s)]
*  Then, when we kept listening, we were introduced to a fitness expert who hates fitness. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=55.64s)]
*  I was and still am in a lot of ways triggered by hearing the word fitness because even before [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=56.8s)]
*  you kind of get engrossed in fitness culture, you are inundated into diet culture and some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=63.76s)]
*  of the toxic messages. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=69.54s)]
*  There is a growing movement to make fitness culture a more inclusive one. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=71.54s)]
*  Ilya Parker is a leading voice in that effort. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=76.68s)]
*  In fact, that was Ilya's voice you heard talking about how fitness is a trigger word. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=79.8s)]
*  Ilya is a physical therapist assistant, a certified medical exercise specialist, and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=85.16s)]
*  the owner of Decolonizing Fitness. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  So here we have a fat fitness constructor, and that's okay. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=93.24s)]
*  Trying to figure out why is NPR collapsing exactly? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=96.44s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of baffling, so we kept listening. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=99.72s)]
*  Then we learned, according to NPR, that if you're going to decolonize fitness, that means [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=102.0s)]
*  you can't let the doctor weigh you because scales are relics of colonialism and white [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=106.32s)]
*  supremacy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=111.6s)]
*  If you're going to your doctor, one thing is that you do not have to be weighed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=113.1s)]
*  It is your right to decline to be weighed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  And so that you certainly can decline when you go. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  The other thing is to let your provider know that you would like medical care from a health [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=121.82s)]
*  at every size perspective and that you would not want to discuss weight or weight management [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  at your visit, that you have the right to ask for that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=131.9s)]
*  We should tell you that all these clips are from just one episode that aired last week. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=134.54s)]
*  Because now we know why all these people are leaving NPR. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=141.34s)]
*  It's not racist and they're just embarrassed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=143.18s)]
*  But not us. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=144.86s)]
*  We're no longer going to criticize NPR. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=145.94s)]
*  We're fans. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=148.06s)]
*  We're going to keep listening. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=149.06s)]
*  Nothing like this has ever appeared on the airwaves anywhere. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=150.06s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=153.86s)]
*  Treat yourself. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVGyRJHuMY&t=155.38s)]
