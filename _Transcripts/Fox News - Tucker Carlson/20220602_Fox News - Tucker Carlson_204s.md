# Buck Sexton: Democrats showing hypocrisy on gun control
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4)
*  So the question is, if you were really concerned about so-called gun violence, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=0.0s)]
*  and we are, everybody should be, thousands of Americans die because they're shot to death [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=3.44s)]
*  every year, mostly in our cities. If that bothered you, if those are your constituents, for example, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=8.0s)]
*  or if you were just a decent person and cared about human life, then you would do something [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=12.8s)]
*  about the violence where it was occurring. But they're doing the opposite. They're letting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=16.88s)]
*  gun criminals off in city after city across America. Buck Sexton has been following this [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=21.52s)]
*  shocking trend. He's hosted the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. He's a former CIA officer. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=26.72s)]
*  We're happy to have him. Buck, thanks so much for coming on. So how can you scream about gun violence [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=30.64s)]
*  and then, as a matter of policy, let gun criminals go? Well, this all stretches back years now to the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=35.84s)]
*  end mass incarceration talking point that progressive prosecutors, whether it's Krasner, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Gascon, you name it, Kim Foxx in Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, New York City, look at [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=49.36s)]
*  the prosecutors in all these places. They were talking about ending mass incarceration. So that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=54.64s)]
*  just meant bring down the number of people overall, just irrespective of anything else, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  that are in their county and city prisons. And what we've seen on the gun front specifically is [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=63.04s)]
*  a lot of diversion program, a lot of dropping of the charges. In the case of Philadelphia, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=68.32s)]
*  you had more than half last year, and this is on the Philadelphia DA website. You can go check it [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=74.16s)]
*  out. More than half of prohibited possessors, meaning people who were previously criminals or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=78.4s)]
*  not allowed to even have a firearm, they had their cases dismissed entirely. So these are often [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=83.52s)]
*  going to be people that have already had a criminal record, that are under no circumstances able to be [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=88.8s)]
*  carrying a gun. They're carrying a gun illegally, and they just make the charge go away. Same thing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=93.28s)]
*  in New York City. Our friend Joe Borelli of Staten Island had a great piece in the Post looking at [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=97.52s)]
*  how of about 4,500 gun arrests in New York City, about 1,000 of them, something like 900 and change, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=102.56s)]
*  effectively were made to go away. And they're either going for lesser sentences, they're going [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=109.44s)]
*  for plea bargains for much lower charges, saying, oh, it's a minor drug charge. Well, actually, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=114.16s)]
*  you just decided not to charge the gun crime. They're doing this time and time again, and it's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=118.72s)]
*  because they don't want to be seen to be coming down too hard disproportionately on communities [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=123.44s)]
*  where there's already, unfortunately, far too much gun violence. Yeah, but letting violent people with [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=128.32s)]
*  firearms walk doesn't help the population of cities, people who are already bearing the brunt of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=134.96s)]
*  this stuff. It's amazing when they're talking about magazine restrictions and gun show loopholes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=140.0s)]
*  We all know that most of the violence, first of all, is coming from handguns, it's related to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=145.44s)]
*  criminal activity, a lot of it is gang violence, and it's centered majorly in cities all across [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=150.72s)]
*  the country. So if you wanted to do something about that, you would think you would handle more [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  the criminal element through the judicial process, through the criminal justice process. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=159.36s)]
*  What we've seen, the district attorney's office in New York is a perfect example of this, and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=163.52s)]
*  people have kind of woken up to this now, Tucker. They have made it so hard and so onerous to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=167.12s)]
*  prosecute lower level gun crimes, meaning possession, lower level crimes across the board, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=172.24s)]
*  intentionally that they have to let a lot of it go, effectively stop prosecuting people, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=177.12s)]
*  because that will make us safer. Right. So our voters get guns, yours don't. I mean, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  we've seen this before. That's what this is. Buck Sachs, I appreciate you're coming on. Thank you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=188.56s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2ytlbtey4&t=192.4s)]
