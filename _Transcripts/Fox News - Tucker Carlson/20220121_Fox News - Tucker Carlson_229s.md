# Gabbard: Washington elites are in the pockets of the military industrial complex
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA)
*  Chelsea Gabbard represented the state of Hawaii in the Congress, as well as the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=0.0s)]
*  itself in the U.S. Army. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  She joins us now to assess what we're seeing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=5.32s)]
*  Chelsea Gabbard, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=7.2s)]
*  So here you have the government of Ukraine complaining because the president suggests [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=10.0s)]
*  that maybe we're not going to go to war next week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=14.76s)]
*  How distorted is our system that we can be pushed into a potentially nuclear-involved [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=17.38s)]
*  conflict by Ukraine? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=24.28s)]
*  Well, let's look at what's really at the heart of what is motivating the decisions being [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=27.44s)]
*  made by our leaders in this country. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=32.32s)]
*  And what we have is, unfortunately, Democrats, Republicans, the mainstream media, the Washington [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=35.52s)]
*  elite, essentially in the pocket of the military-industrial complex. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  And rather than looking out for what's in the best interests of the American people, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=45.96s)]
*  our national security, our country, they see dollar signs when they look at Ukraine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  They see how they can line their pockets, how they can look tough, how they can posture [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=55.84s)]
*  themselves in a position where they personally or politically or financially benefit, rather [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  than actually thinking about what are the costs and consequences of these actions and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=67.76s)]
*  who pays the price. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  It's the American people and, frankly, the people of Ukraine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  So my guess is that some of the people pushing for war don't actually want a real war with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Russia. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=83.36s)]
*  They want a real economy in a second, for one thing, and they'd be held responsible. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=85.08s)]
*  My concern is they're so inept, they so lack fine motor skills, that they're going to talk [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=88.08s)]
*  themselves into getting us into a war inadvertently. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=92.36s)]
*  They've got a long track record of ineptitude. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=95.56s)]
*  Are you worried about that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=98.0s)]
*  I'm deeply concerned about that because that's very much the direction that we are headed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=100.0s)]
*  You know, Tucker, I look back to early 2017 when then-President Trump said, hey, it would [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=105.36s)]
*  be good if we got along with Russia. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=112.84s)]
*  You remember the reaction to that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=115.4s)]
*  Everyone from Democratic leaders, Republican leaders, people in the mainstream media, they [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  said absolutely no way. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  There were people in Trump's own administration, warmongers like John Bolton, Nikki Haley, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=124.36s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, who outright rejected it and went on their own agenda. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=129.24s)]
*  And we're seeing the results of this now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=134.4s)]
*  We're seeing the result of how we have continued to have these warmongers escalating tensions, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=136.34s)]
*  putting us in this disastrous position today, leaving us, the American people, with frankly [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=141.88000000000002s)]
*  the responsibility to stand up and say we will not accept this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=147.68s)]
*  We will not be sheep, allowing these warmongers in Washington to lead us down this very, very [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  dangerous and costly path. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=156.84s)]
*  I'll never forget when you came out as a sitting member of Congress and said, well, maybe we [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  shouldn't actually fight the Russians in Syria. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=164.36s)]
*  And you were denounced as a Russian agent, also as a racist for not wanting to bomb another [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=167.44s)]
*  Middle Eastern country, which was my favorite attack ever because it was so insane. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=171.44s)]
*  But you paid a real cost for that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=175.72s)]
*  They attacked you every day you served in Congress over that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=177.44s)]
*  So it seems like this is the red line for them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=180.72s)]
*  You criticize war and they won't stop in their effort to destroy you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=183.1s)]
*  And all of these threads we're talking about here point back to that core motivation, motivation [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=188.52s)]
*  that sadly does not lie in serving the best interests of the American people, our security, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=193.92s)]
*  and our country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=198.94s)]
*  It comes from a very selfish place of how they can get more power and get more money [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=200.26s)]
*  and who they really work for. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=205.42s)]
*  It's not the American people. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=206.73999999999998s)]
*  No, it's certainly not. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  That is absolutely right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=210.32s)]
*  Thank you for saying that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=211.73999999999998s)]
*  Again, you paid a cost for it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  Chelsea Gabbard, good to see you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO3hdQjM2PA&t=214.73999999999998s)]
