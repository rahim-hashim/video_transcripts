# Economist to Tucker: Biden's 'reckless policy' will put Americans 'underwater'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc)
*  Stephanie Pomboy is an economist, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=0.0s)]
*  CEO of Macro Maven. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=1.54s)]
*  She joins us tonight to assess. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=2.84s)]
*  Stephanie, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=4.32s)]
*  So as always, the beneficiaries of these schemes [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=6.0s)]
*  are never the people they tell you they are. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=8.64s)]
*  Oh, the oppressed, the hopeless, and our inner cities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=10.42s)]
*  It's always their donors who are buying up [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=12.6s)]
*  residential homes and turning them into rental properties. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=15.42s)]
*  I mean, that's who's winning here, Democratic donors. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=17.8s)]
*  Gee, you think? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=21.64s)]
*  You know, I'm reminded of that old expression. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=23.34s)]
*  Those who refuse to learn from history [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  are doomed to repeat it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=29.62s)]
*  We tried this exercise under George Bush [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  when they decided that we needed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=34.94s)]
*  to create a home ownership society. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=36.86s)]
*  And, you know, the Bush administration, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  in conjunction with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=42.1s)]
*  you'll recall Franklin Reigns and Barney Frank, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=44.32s)]
*  all got in and decided that we needed to make it easier [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=48.06s)]
*  for people to become homeowners. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=51.56s)]
*  And we all remember how well [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=54.22s)]
*  that whole situation worked out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=55.82s)]
*  But I would argue this situation is even more sinister [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=58.66s)]
*  than what you outlined in terms of trying to get people [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=61.66s)]
*  to move to the suburbs and, you know, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=64.06s)]
*  basically control them into home ownership [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=66.82s)]
*  because we are on the doorstep [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=70.5s)]
*  of another deflating home bubble right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=72.58s)]
*  So essentially what they're doing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=76.7s)]
*  is they're encouraging people to stretch into homes [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=79.06s)]
*  that they couldn't otherwise afford, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=81.82s)]
*  precisely as the floor is about to fall out underneath them [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=83.86s)]
*  as prices decline. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=88.22000000000001s)]
*  And we got existing homes sales [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=90.06s)]
*  as reported by the National Association of Realtors yesterday, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=92.30000000000001s)]
*  and it reflects the second back-to-back month [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  of declining home prices. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=99.06s)]
*  So it's here already. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=101.06s)]
*  And we have seen sales volumes just collapse [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  at a speed that is even faster [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=106.5s)]
*  than we saw during the housing bubble bust. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=108.58000000000001s)]
*  And that presages an equally substantial decline on prices. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=110.78s)]
*  So I think we will, again, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=115.36s)]
*  for only the second time in our history, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=117.12s)]
*  see nationwide home prices decline. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=119.64s)]
*  So this idea that now is the time to encourage people [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=122.88s)]
*  who can't otherwise afford to get into homes to do so [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=126.08s)]
*  is really, really dangerous. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=129.44s)]
*  These people will probably be underwater in their homes [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=131.56s)]
*  before they even get the keys. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=134.36s)]
*  Then what? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=136.72s)]
*  Then what kind of policy are they gonna prescribe? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=137.56s)]
*  You know, I shudder to imagine. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=140.0s)]
*  And, you know, it goes without saying, Tucker, or it should, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=142.4s)]
*  that the reason homes are increasingly unaffordable [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=145.24s)]
*  for people is because we have spent over a decade [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=148.68s)]
*  pushing money into this economy [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=152.28s)]
*  with reckless monetary and fiscal policy [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=155.24s)]
*  that inflated a massive bubble in housing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=158.46s)]
*  that now the Fed is raising rates to dampen. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=161.12s)]
*  So you have a combination of inflated home prices [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=164.28s)]
*  and higher interest rates that have made it unaffordable. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  It's not racism that's making homes unaffordable. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  It's reckless policy, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=173.12s)]
*  and they're layering more reckless policy on top to solve it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=174.76s)]
*  So nicely put, so nicely put. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  This is what asset inflation looks like [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  for the average person. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=182.16s)]
*  Stephanie Pomboy, I appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=183.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TNdPdC_Gc&t=184.8s)]
