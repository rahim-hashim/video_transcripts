# Tucker Carlson clashes with Rep. Salazar over Russia-Ukraine war and borders
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0)
*  So things are changing very fast. For weeks, leaders in Washington told us that an American-backed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=0.0s)]
*  no-fly zone in Ukraine would be unwise because it would amount to an act of war against a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=5.32s)]
*  nuclear-armed Russia. As you can see, those views have evolved a lot. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=9.96s)]
*  But in fairness, Congresswoman Maria Salazar got there first. Salazar is a longtime news [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=15.68s)]
*  anchor from Miami who a little over a year ago was elected to Congress as a Republican. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=20.44s)]
*  She now sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee. A week ago, a reporter from the gray zone [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=24.68s)]
*  asked Salazar what she thought of a no-fly zone. Here's what she said. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=28.36s)]
*  Do you support a no-fly zone in Ukraine? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=31.8s)]
*  I support everything that has to do with punishing Vladimir Putin and helping the Ukrainians. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  Wouldn't that mean direct conventional warfare with Russia? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what it will mean, but you know freedom is not free. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=43.96s)]
*  So you don't know what a no-fly zone will mean? Do you have to shoot down Russian planes? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=46.84s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=51.2s)]
*  I don't know what it will mean, but you know freedom is not free. Now we made fun of that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=52.8s)]
*  answer last week when we first showed you that clip. But now what we mocked is the consensus [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=57.88s)]
*  in Washington. We don't know what's going to happen. We've got to do it immediately. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=63.36s)]
*  That's the argument you're hearing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=66.12s)]
*  At this point, no one wants to say it out loud, but it is true, at this point a shooting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  war with Russia seems inevitable. How could war with Russia not be inevitable? Virtually [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=71.92s)]
*  everyone with power is for it. We remain against it. We think that joining a war in Eastern [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=77.64s)]
*  Europe will hurt this country, though to be clear, when and if that war starts, we will [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  be praying passionately for America's total victory. Unlike so many in the foreign policy [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=87.72s)]
*  establishment, we love this country above all and we mean it. But in the meantime, while [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=92.96s)]
*  the United States is still technically at peace, we thought it would be worth asking [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=97.12s)]
*  people who are calling for war if they have considered in detail what a war would mean [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=100.16s)]
*  for this country. Congresswoman Maria Salazar was gracious enough to accept our invitation [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=104.12s)]
*  to come on the show. We're grateful she did. She joins us tonight. Congresswoman, thanks [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  so much for coming on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=112.16s)]
*  Of course. Thank you for inviting me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  Yes. So since you have called for war with Russia, how do you think that war, once it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=116.72s)]
*  begins, would play out? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=122.96s)]
*  I think that's a hypothetical question. I think that we should concentrate, Tucker, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=126.44s)]
*  in what Zelensky asked Congress today, which is to take on the opportunity. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=131.12s)]
*  I'm sorry. I can't, and I'm in no way trying to cut you off, but I can't let you allot [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=135.32s)]
*  over that. You said we should shoot down Russian planes. That's of course war. Since you've [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=141.28s)]
*  called for that, you are a member of Congress. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=146.44s)]
*  I think. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, you just said that on the tape we played. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  That was taken out of context because I said, of course, that I know what that means. That [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  interview was not very well conducted and that's why I'm here because I want to clarify [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=158.6s)]
*  my position. And my position is that we should not take the no-fly zone off the table. But [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=163.36s)]
*  before that, that's two. We need to do one. And one is to give Zelensky exactly what he's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=170.88s)]
*  asking for. No troops on the ground. Let's give him the MiG-3 and the S-300 what he needs [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=176.16s)]
*  to defend his own airspace. So he will create his own no-fly zone. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's what I think we should have done months ago. It's embarrassing that this guy, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  this president, who is under the bullets, has come to Congress to beg for us to give [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=193.72s)]
*  him something that we should have done long time ago. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=198.64s)]
*  Okay, let me be clear. When you say we should give President Zelensky what he's asking for, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=201.64s)]
*  he demanded today, I think you were there, that the United States enforce the no-fly [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=207.2s)]
*  zone. So you are for denying him that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=211.68s)]
*  Well, but he also said, and then we can give you alternatives. So since we know that that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=215.0s)]
*  should not be taken off the table, and I repeat it, I do believe that we should go to Plan [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=221.2s)]
*  A, which is to give them all the military weapons that he's asking for. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=227.04s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of people sympathize with that. Let me just say, I think a lot of people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=231.4s)]
*  who saw President Zelensky's speech today and who've seen the atrocities in Ukraine [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  feel deep sympathy for the Ukrainian people and want this to end. I'm certainly among [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=240.32s)]
*  them. But I'm wondering about the implications. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure you are. So then I am asking you, so then what should we do? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=248.92s)]
*  Okay, all right. So what should we do then? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Always and everywhere, especially for the U.S. government or one of its elected representatives, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  act on behalf of the core interests of the United States government. It's really super [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=259.32s)]
*  simple. So if the United States is providing weapons- [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=262.84s)]
*  And let me just tell you now that you said that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=265.52s)]
*  Let me ask you. Hold on. If the United States is providing weapons to one side in a war, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=267.52s)]
*  how is that not participating in the war? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=272.8s)]
*  Listen, let me just backtrack and say that you say that we're supposed to be representing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=275.52s)]
*  the American people. I represent district number 27, where you have millions of Cuban [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=280.48s)]
*  Americans and I'm representing what we think. We know that we acquired peace through strength. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=285.24s)]
*  Look at what happened in 1960. Fidel Castro and JFK. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  Stop. I'm sorry. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm not going to take the anti-communist lecture [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=295.76s)]
*  from anybody because of course I agree with you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=300.32s)]
*  No, no, no. I'm just saying that history- [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=302.12s)]
*  And by the way, I hope that you're not speaking for quote Cuban Americans but for all Americans [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=303.12s)]
*  because it's not a racial question. It's a question of national interest. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=306.56s)]
*  I'm representing district number 27. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=310.2s)]
*  I understand. I understand. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  And we believe- [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  But I'm just saying. I got it. And I'm as against communism, I think, as anybody. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  But my question is, if we are providing weapons to one side in a war, I think it's fair to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=317.8s)]
*  ask. Maybe the other side would say that's an act of war against us. And if that happens, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=324.76s)]
*  then what next? And to not think about that seems negligent, but since you're on the Foreign [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=330.48s)]
*  Affairs Committee, I know that you have thought it through. So tell me your views on what [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=334.28s)]
*  would happen next. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=337.2s)]
*  Tucker, we have been providing javelins and stingers and ammunition, and we're providing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=338.92s)]
*  a lot of military armament. So what is the difference between that and the MiGs and the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=344.16s)]
*  S-300s? What's the difference? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=349.44s)]
*  I mean, you have to understand that we are, unfortunately, the United States has fallen [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=351.44s)]
*  into the Vladimir Putin's trap. He is the one dictating what we're going to do, what [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=357.24s)]
*  we're not going to do. He said we do not want, we are imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=361.96s)]
*  So we're letting Putin control our behavior. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  Of course we are. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=370.48s)]
*  So that seems like a loss right there. But let me just ask you, because we believe, we [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=371.48s)]
*  don't need more evidence that Putin has bad intent, that he's evil, a lot of people believe [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=377.16s)]
*  he's crazy, including some informed people, including many Russians. So we know he's volatile, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  and we know that he's heavily armed. How many nuclear weapons, by the way, does Russia have? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=387.76s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  Many. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  About 6,000 is the guess. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  One is enough. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  One is enough. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  So are we concerned at all that he might use a nuclear weapon against the United States? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=396.76s)]
*  Is that a concern? Is that something that you consider as you recommend these policies? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  Of course. Of course that we're very concerned. And we're also concerned that he may be throwing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=408.35999999999996s)]
*  a biological weapon against the Ukrainians within the next few hours, because he cannot [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=415.44s)]
*  take Kiev as he thought he was going to. So of course that we are confronting a dictator. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=421.08s)]
*  But I think that we should put this into context, and I thank you very much for giving me the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=430.12s)]
*  opportunity. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=433.88s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=434.88s)]
*  If we believe in the free world, that this is just going to be the first or the last [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=435.88s)]
*  confrontation with a bad actor, we're in for a very big surprise. Because if we do not [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=439.47999999999996s)]
*  confront bad actors with strength, then we're going to have China and Russia and Iran and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=444.8s)]
*  Fidel and Venezuela and Nicaragua watching what we're doing. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=450.72s)]
*  Hold on. Hold on. But if, and needless to say, I've made that argument for 30 years [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  on television. The question is, are we doing it with all available risks known to the population [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  in whose name we're doing it? So I'm asking you, what do you think the chances are, and [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=466.76s)]
*  I'm sure you've gamed this out as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, that Putin [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  uses nuclear weapon against the United States in response to this? What would you calculate [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  the chances? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=478.08s)]
*  He can assure that we are taking that into consideration. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=479.08s)]
*  But what do you think the likelihood, I mean, our viewers are, I'm sure, supporting you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=482.2s)]
*  I think most conservatives are on your side. But I just think they should know what the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=486.44s)]
*  informed view of the likelihood of a retaliatory nuclear strike from Vladimir Putin is. What [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=491.4s)]
*  would you assess it as being? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  And I repeat, that's a hypothetical question. And I believe that he will not. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=501.06s)]
*  He will not take that step if, starting today, the Biden administration will send the message [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=505.74s)]
*  that we are in charge, that NATO is ready to confront him. And so are we. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=512.1s)]
*  And that is the problem that I believe. I'm not sure if you share in my view that you [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=517.62s)]
*  obtain peace, you obtain, you can, you can, they take the, they take all the power away [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=522.78s)]
*  from Putin if you show strength. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=531.5s)]
*  OK, so do you believe that, do you believe that's true? So President Zelensky said yesterday [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=533.8199999999999s)]
*  that he is considering declaring that Ukraine would not join NATO in exchange for having [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=540.14s)]
*  Russian troops withdraw from his country. Would you describe, this is President Zelensky [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=548.42s)]
*  speaking, would you describe that as... [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=552.42s)]
*  Zelensky can, who am I to say what's correct and what's incorrect? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=554.3399999999999s)]
*  Would you accept, would you, I don't know, you, OK. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=559.14s)]
*  I am going to, I think that we should accept anything coming from him. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=562.02s)]
*  So, but, no, wait, hold on, please don't dodge the questions. Is that, is that, would that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=564.9799999999999s)]
*  be an answer you'd be satisfied with? If Zelensky made good on what he just suggested, that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=567.3s)]
*  neutrality, will relinquish claims to Crimea and the Russians leave, would that be OK with [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=572.8599999999999s)]
*  you? Would you consider that an honorable exit or would you consider it a display of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=580.02s)]
*  weakness? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=583.26s)]
*  If Zelensky comes to the United States Congress and he says that this is the best path forward, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=585.38s)]
*  we are no one to say something to the contrary. But I don't think he's going to say that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=591.0999999999999s)]
*  So, we're, we're creating scenarios here that are hypothetical. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=596.06s)]
*  No, no, we're not. He, he, you may not be following this closely, but he has said that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=598.9399999999999s)]
*  multiple times. So, of course, that outcome would, that would spare the deaths of... [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=603.62s)]
*  And now you understand and I have heard it. And that is up to him. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=608.74s)]
*  OK, but that would spare the deaths, and since I know you have great concern for the civilian [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=609.74s)]
*  population of Ukraine, that would spare the deaths... [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=612.86s)]
*  Of course, we all do. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=615.18s)]
*  Of untold thousands and preserve the capital city from being destroyed. So, would that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=616.3399999999999s)]
*  be better than increasing the level of armed conflict in Ukraine? Which would be a better [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=620.42s)]
*  outcome? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=627.42s)]
*  It's for the Ukrainians to decide. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=627.78s)]
*  What do you mean? You're, you're, you're an American policy maker who's imposing your [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=629.38s)]
*  views on Ukraine. And I'm asking you simply, would that be a better... [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=632.78s)]
*  I am not imposing any views. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=635.78s)]
*  Why not push? Well, of course you are. You're saying we need to send materiel, billions [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=636.5s)]
*  of dollars armed military. And I'm not criticizing your position. I'm just asking you, has it [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=642.98s)]
*  occurred that many lives might be saved if we were to encourage the peaceful Solution [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=648.4599999999999s)]
*  that's already on the table? Are you doing anything in that direction? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=656.06s)]
*  If the Ukrainians want to go that route, they have the right to, and we are no one to say [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=660.9s)]
*  anything about it because they are the ones dying on the streets, and they're the ones [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=667.7399999999999s)]
*  under... [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=671.9s)]
*  Would you... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=672.0999999999999s)]
*  ...being bombarded. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=672.4599999999999s)]
*  They certainly are. They certainly are dying. That's right. I don't notice any members of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=672.78s)]
*  Congress or David Frum laying down their lives. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=676.6999999999999s)]
*  Listen, I think that... [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=678.8599999999999s)]
*  ...since the Ukrainians. But have you suggested that? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=679.18s)]
*  Tucker, I think that we have talked about this point enough. I also wanted you to give me [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=682.62s)]
*  the opportunity... [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=688.38s)]
*  Oh, we have? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=688.86s)]
*  ...to explain to you... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=689.4200000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you one... [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=690.46s)]
*  ...because you said that I was in favor of open borders and I wanted to. I talked to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=691.4200000000001s)]
*  your production... [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=695.82s)]
*  Well, you just called last month for the amnesty for tens of millions of people who came into [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  this country illegally. Oh, but you did because I read the legislation today. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=701.0200000000001s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=704.7800000000001s)]
*  Actually, about 20 minutes ago I read it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that you have... [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=707.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=708.0600000000001s)]
*  Okay, I'm glad you did. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=708.7s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=710.3000000000001s)]
*  And I will invite you to read it again because let me... Just give me 30 seconds and I promise [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=710.7800000000001s)]
*  I'll give it to you in sound bites. The Dignity Act, which I presented last month, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=715.9000000000001s)]
*  is an immigration reform law, probably the first one that the GOP has presented in a long time. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=721.5s)]
*  It has one of the strongest border security measures in the history of the United States [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=727.74s)]
*  Congress. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=733.6600000000001s)]
*  Right, got it. But it also provides amnesty for tens of millions of people. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=733.9000000000001s)]
*  Amnesty is what we have now, Tucker. Amnesty is when you have more than 13 million illegals, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=739.18s)]
*  listen to me, without paying for schools, for roads, or for hospitals. I am giving them [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=746.4599999999999s)]
*  dignity so they can start paying and they can... [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=751.98s)]
*  Now we're getting pretty deep into the talking points here. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=754.62s)]
*  No, we're not getting deep. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=757.18s)]
*  What you're doing is people who came here... [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=757.5799999999999s)]
*  No, we're not getting deep. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=758.4599999999999s)]
*  People who came over our border without permission are not being punished. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=759.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=764.6999999999999s)]
*  They are instead being rewarded. And so you... [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=764.78s)]
*  No, they're not. Let me answer to that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=767.66s)]
*  ...are applying a very different standard to Ukraine. I'm wondering if Russians fleeing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=769.5s)]
*  Putin, do you believe, should be allowed to start new and better lives in Ukraine? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=773.98s)]
*  And I bet you know... [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=778.4599999999999s)]
*  If you allow me. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=778.86s)]
*  ...because you believe in Ukrainian nationalism, but not America. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=779.5799999999999s)]
*  I want to be rigorous. I'm talking about those people who have lived here for more than five [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=782.6999999999999s)]
*  years, that have not committed a crime, that have American children, and who are contributing [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=787.5s)]
*  to our economy. I want to give them something called dignity. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=793.5s)]
*  And then redemption. I'm not talking about path to citizenship. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=797.74s)]
*  I'm not talking about amnesty. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=801.66s)]
*  Well, of course you are. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=803.26s)]
*  I'm talking about... [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=803.34s)]
*  No, no, but let me... No, I'm not. And I don't want you to misrepresent what we did. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=804.14s)]
*  And we worked for one whole year so we can solve... [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=808.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=811.98s)]
*  ...just because this bill doesn't... [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=812.06s)]
*  Then let me ask you. Let me ask you. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=813.18s)]
*  You don't agree. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=814.62s)]
*  Our viewers can read the bill. Let me ask you a simple question. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=815.26s)]
*  You're presenting MIGs to Ukraine. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=818.06s)]
*  The fact that you don't agree with me doesn't mean that you have to misrepresent [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=819.1s)]
*  what's on the bill. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=823.18s)]
*  Okay. Well, our... Look, I think you've said it yourself, that people who came here illegally, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=823.9799999999999s)]
*  tens of millions of them, would be allowed to stay. They would not be punished. They [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=828.8599999999999s)]
*  would be rewarded. Now, you think that's enhancing your dignity? By the way, I'm not against those [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=832.6999999999999s)]
*  people. I just can't help notice the contrast between your desire to send MIGs to Ukraine to [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=836.14s)]
*  preserve its borders, but not here. Should we send the U.S. military to the Mexican border, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=840.9399999999999s)]
*  since you have admitted that tens of millions of people have come here illegally, that our [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=845.5s)]
*  borders are porous, they're not defended, they are open. Should we send the U.S. military... [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=849.26s)]
*  So that is why... [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=853.1s)]
*  ...to the Mexican border? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=853.58s)]
*  That is why I have created a whole plan so we can really seal the border, because you know what? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=855.1s)]
*  Would you... [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=860.94s)]
*  My community, the one that I represent... [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=861.4200000000001s)]
*  Would you call for sending... [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=862.22s)]
*  Let me finish. Let me finish. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=863.26s)]
*  You represent America, if I could say? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=864.46s)]
*  The one that I represent. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=865.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=867.1800000000001s)]
*  Listen, I am... Let me finish. Give me 15 seconds. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=867.5s)]
*  I shall. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=871.26s)]
*  I have... Thank you. I have created a series of measures so we can secure the border, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=871.98s)]
*  because we, the Browns, the Hispanics, the Latinos in this country, are not in favor of open borders. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=878.46s)]
*  The problem is that no one asks us. We want to live in the promised land, and we want to contribute, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=884.0600000000001s)]
*  because you know very well that if we deport those 11 or 13 million, we may not have food by Friday. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=890.14s)]
*  Why? Because the food supply chain... [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=896.94s)]
*  Let me... Okay. I got to... Please, and I'm sorry, I let you... I think everyone understands this, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=898.14s)]
*  that we have other supply chain issues, and by the way, I'm not attacking anybody living in [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=901.98s)]
*  this country legally or illegally. I'm asking a question about borders. All of us are appalled [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=905.66s)]
*  by the violation of Ukraine's borders. You don't seem as appalled by the violation of our borders, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=910.4599999999999s)]
*  by tens of millions of people, so let me ask you for the third time. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=915.9s)]
*  Sure, I do. That's a major representation. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=918.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay, then would you support the U.S. military securing the United States border tonight, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=921.5s)]
*  or on the same timetable as sending mix to Ukraine? How about that? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=927.3399999999999s)]
*  That's hypothetical again. Let's talk about the border. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=931.8199999999999s)]
*  No, it's a very straightforward question. What are you talking about? You're a lawmaker. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=933.58s)]
*  No, it's not. It's not hypothetical. What do you mean? Just say it. You're not for it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=936.46s)]
*  I am saying... And you're for Ukraine, but not here. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=939.98s)]
*  You're giving me the whole segment, which is great, and I thank you very much. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=942.46s)]
*  But correct me if I'm wrong. Let's go back to my bill. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=946.86s)]
*  I don't want to misrepresent you. I am correct. All I'm saying is... [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=948.22s)]
*  You don't support sending the U.S. military to the border. You don't. I just want our viewers [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=951.0200000000001s)]
*  to understand that you're for defending a foreign country, but not our own. I think it's pretty [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=954.7s)]
*  clear. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I am supporting for all the technology we could find [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=959.18s)]
*  so we can secure the border. All the military, the veterans, the police forces that we could hire [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=964.62s)]
*  so we can secure and seal the border, not only for people, but fentanyl and child sex traffickers. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=971.0999999999999s)]
*  So I just told you, the bill is right there. There's technology. It's not so simple as to say, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=977.26s)]
*  you're going to put this or that. It's a series of technicalities, a series of technology that... [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=982.38s)]
*  I get it. I get it. That is for the border. All right. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=988.3s)]
*  I agree with your intent. If you're for securing the border, I'm totally on your side. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=990.6999999999999s)]
*  Good. And thank you for mentioning fentanyl. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=994.06s)]
*  Then what are you going to do? But let me ask you something. What are you going to do? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=994.6999999999999s)]
*  Then let me just ask you a question. Can you see why Americans who support the Ukrainians' [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=996.38s)]
*  right to secure their own borders, I certainly do. Most people do. All Americans do. Can you [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1002.8599999999999s)]
*  see the frustration that they might feel listening to you, a lawmaker, say, yeah, there's a process, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1007.9s)]
*  but when it happens in a foreign country, we have to send billions of the U.S. military, your sons, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1013.3399999999999s)]
*  but we can't kind of do that here because why? I mean, can you sort of understand the frustration [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1018.54s)]
*  a little bit? But I have never said that I want to send [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1023.02s)]
*  troops, our boys, to fight in Ukraine because I don't think that Zelensky is asked. You're sending [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1027.18s)]
*  fighter planes. And we're sending at the same time stingers and javelins and ammunitions, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1030.06s)]
*  and we're sending a lot of things that are related to the military. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1035.98s)]
*  Why not treat our own border with the same seriousness? That's it. But you're not. You're [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1037.26s)]
*  not treating our border crisis with any level of the same seriousness you're treating your friends. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1041.4199999999998s)]
*  You're misrepresenting. No, it's not true. You're misrepresenting this bill that is probably one of [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1044.38s)]
*  the best bills that has been presented when it talks about immigration reform law. I invite you [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1051.8200000000002s)]
*  to read it and invite me back so we can discuss it. All right. Congressman, I don't agree with you, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1057.1000000000001s)]
*  but I certainly appreciate your coming on. It's hard to get people to do that, and I appreciate [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1064.8600000000001s)]
*  that you did. Thanks. Of course. Invite me again so we can continue talking about immigration, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1070.38s)]
*  which is one of the biggest problems we have. And if the GOP doesn't realize it, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1074.6200000000001s)]
*  we will never win another election again. Yeah. You could actually, I think Hispanic voters are [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1078.38s)]
*  trending Republican because they're for border security, the kind that you are not providing. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1083.3400000000001s)]
*  It's not true. Once again, you're misrepresenting. You are misrepresenting my bill. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1089.0200000000002s)]
*  Read it yourself. Thanks so much. Good to see you. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSxnyA_8RI0&t=1095.5s)]
