# DC Mayor's spokesman switches to GOP over Biden presidency, illegal immigration crisis
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c)
*  For a long time, Victor Jimenez was a very active Democrat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=0.0s)]
*  He worked in Democratic Party politics. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=3.44s)]
*  Most recently, he was a spokesman [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=5.64s)]
*  for the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  Jimenez recently went viral after telling Telemundo [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  that after watching the first year of the Biden presidency, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=12.48s)]
*  he's leaving the Democratic Party. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=15.64s)]
*  I think Biden has made me a Republican. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=18.78s)]
*  Biden is destroying the economy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=21.02s)]
*  The inflation is in the sky. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=23.28s)]
*  And it's terrible, everything. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=27.26s)]
*  Victor Jimenez joins us now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=30.92s)]
*  Victor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=32.36s)]
*  Boy, you put it as succinctly as I can imagine in that clip. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=34.0s)]
*  So you are the spokesman for the mayor of Washington, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=38.94s)]
*  the most Democratic city in the country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=41.44s)]
*  There's like 94% for Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=42.7s)]
*  And you left and switched parties. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=44.74s)]
*  That's not a small decision, it doesn't seem like. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=46.58s)]
*  It's not a small decision. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=49.54s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me, Tucker. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  I was a public information officer [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=53.92s)]
*  for the D.C. Mayor's Office on Latino Affairs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=55.72s)]
*  And then I was the lead public information officer [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=58.54s)]
*  at the Mayor's Office on Community Affairs. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=61.14s)]
*  And yeah, I had to leave. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  So tell us why. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=66.64s)]
*  You told Telemundo, I thought, pretty well, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=68.18s)]
*  but flesh out a little bit, if you would. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=70.14s)]
*  I told, the reason I switched parties [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=73.22s)]
*  is because of everything that's going on [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=76.16s)]
*  in the country right now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  We see immigration through the roof right now, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=79.12s)]
*  and that's affecting a lot of Hispanic families [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=83.76s)]
*  in my home state of Virginia, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=87.46s)]
*  and those people who are already struggling [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=91.6s)]
*  with making ends meet. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=93.44s)]
*  Another reason why I left the Democratic Party, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  it's because of the immigration issue [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=98.94s)]
*  that's going on right now in our country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=101.94s)]
*  If you look at the southern border, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=104.62s)]
*  we have people who, thousands of people, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=107.22s)]
*  who are just waiting there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=109.86s)]
*  And I'm not saying we don't have good people [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=111.36s)]
*  trying to come into the country with good intentions, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=113.72s)]
*  but we also have bad people coming into the country [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  with bad intentions, people with illegal guns, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=118.08s)]
*  with illegal drugs, and people who are running [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  from their law enforcement in their country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  So we don't know exactly what they're doing here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=126.82s)]
*  And so those reasons and more made me switch parties [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  because Biden is completely destroying the economy right now [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=136.56s)]
*  and people can feel it in their pockets [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=138.66s)]
*  and in their communities with, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=141.14s)]
*  you know, increased violence and increased crime. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  And people, especially in the Hispanic community, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=147.9s)]
*  can feel it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Yes, it's so interesting that their assumption [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=151.56s)]
*  at the White House is anyone who speaks Spanish [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=153.6s)]
*  is for open borders, but that doesn't seem to be true at all. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  No, I think, me for example, being Hispanic and also black, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=159.74s)]
*  I should be Democrat by default, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=164.24s)]
*  but I'm going against their narrative. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  And I feel like right now, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=170.84s)]
*  everything is crumbling for the Democrats. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=173.14s)]
*  And we saw in Virginia a couple of weeks ago, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  the beginning of the end with the victory of Glenn Youngkin, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=177.72s)]
*  which I voted for. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=181.38s)]
*  And I feel like in 2022 next year, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  we're gonna see more of that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=186.82s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  You may be the leading edge of something big. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=190.26s)]
*  I bet the mayor of DC is very confused by this, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=192.16s)]
*  but we appreciate your coming on. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=195.14s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  Victor Jimenez, I didn't even ask you about her, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  but we appreciate your coming on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=199.82000000000002s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much, Dr. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IVOiq2C3c&t=201.76000000000002s)]
