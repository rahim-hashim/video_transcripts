# George Santos on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight': 'I made a mistake'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU)
*  Now permanent Washington has created a culture where it's acceptable to lie to further your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=0.0s)]
*  own interests. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=5.48s)]
*  Just try not to get caught. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=6.88s)]
*  I should know. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=7.88s)]
*  I served in Congress for eight years. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=8.88s)]
*  But even when these politicians do get caught, people just shrug their shoulders and move [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=11.34s)]
*  on. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=15.96s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=16.96s)]
*  No consequences. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=17.96s)]
*  A few examples. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=18.96s)]
*  Dick Blumenthal lied about his military service. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=19.96s)]
*  And of course, Elizabeth Warren, she lied about having Native American heritage. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=22.76s)]
*  So no one should be surprised that the American people don't trust these politicians. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=27.96s)]
*  They've got no faith that those in Washington are actually working for the people when they're [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=32.6s)]
*  so clearly working for themselves. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=37.56s)]
*  Now there are new accusations that George Santos, who was just elected to represent [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=40.72s)]
*  New York in Congress in this past election, has actually been lying extensively about [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  his own past. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=49.64s)]
*  Now he admits to some of these deceptions. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=51.24s)]
*  For example, Santos acknowledges that he, quote, embellished his resume by saying that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=53.36s)]
*  he graduated from Baruch College. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=58.48s)]
*  But he didn't. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=61.16s)]
*  Santos has also admitted he never actually worked for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, even [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=63.0s)]
*  though his website suggested that he did. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=67.0s)]
*  Additionally, Santos once called himself a proud Jew. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=70.44s)]
*  But in an interview with the New York Post, Santos now says, quote, I am Catholic because [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=74.7s)]
*  I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=79.54s)]
*  I said I was Jew-ish. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=82.58000000000001s)]
*  There are other accusations. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=87.14s)]
*  But now we have the opportunity to hear directly from George Santos himself. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=88.58000000000001s)]
*  This is his very first TV interview since these accusations surfaced. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=92.34s)]
*  George Santos joins us now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=96.5s)]
*  Congressman-elect Santos, thank you for joining us today. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=100.98s)]
*  First question I really want to ask you now that all this has been revealed is, what does [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=105.66s)]
*  the word integrity mean to you? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=110.58s)]
*  Well, Tulsi, thank you for having me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=113.46s)]
*  You know, to answer your question, integrity is very important. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=116.38s)]
*  And like I said to the New York Post, embellishing my resume was a mistake. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=120.82s)]
*  What does it mean, though? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=125.22s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=126.22s)]
*  Because the meaning of the word actually matters in practice. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=127.22s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=131.32s)]
*  It means to carry yourself in an honorable way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=132.32s)]
*  And I made a mistake. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=135.36s)]
*  And I think humans are flawed. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=136.76000000000002s)]
*  And we all make mistakes, Tulsi. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=138.28s)]
*  I think we can all look at ourselves in the mirror and admit that once in our life we [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=140.52s)]
*  made a mistake. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=143.44000000000003s)]
*  I'm having to admit this in national television for the whole country to see. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=144.44000000000003s)]
*  And I have the courage to do so because I believe that, in order to move past this and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=147.94000000000003s)]
*  move forward and be an effective member of Congress, I have to face my mistakes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=152.0s)]
*  And I'm facing them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=155.44000000000003s)]
*  The reality is, is that I remain committed to doing everything I set forward in my campaign. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm not a fraud. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=162.56s)]
*  I'm not a fake. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=163.56s)]
*  I didn't materialize from thin air. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=164.76s)]
*  I worked damn hard to get where I got my entire life. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=167.28s)]
*  Life wasn't easy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=171.56s)]
*  It didn't start off easy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=172.56s)]
*  As I've said it many, many times, I come from abject poverty. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=173.9s)]
*  I made some mistakes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=177.6s)]
*  And I own up to them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=179.52s)]
*  And now I want to put this past me so I can deliver for the American people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=181.06s)]
*  The thing is, Congressman-elect, integrity means, yes, carrying yourself with honor, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=185.78s)]
*  but it means telling the truth, being a person of integrity. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=190.72s)]
*  And if I were one of those in New York's third district right now, now that the election [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  is over and I'm finding out all of these lies that you've told, not just one little lie [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  or one little embellishment, these are blatant lies. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  My question is, do you have no shame? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=208.14s)]
*  Do you have no shame in the people who are now you're asking to trust you to go and be [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=211.17999999999998s)]
*  their voice for them, their families, and their kids in Washington? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  Tulsi, I can say the same thing about the Democrats and the party. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=220.72s)]
*  Look at Joe Biden. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=224.38s)]
*  Joe Biden's been lying to the American people for 40 years. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=225.38s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  Democrats resoundly support him. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=230.16s)]
*  Do they have no shame? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=232.72s)]
*  Look, I've made this very clear. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=233.72s)]
*  I made a mistake. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=235.72s)]
*  This is not about the Democratic Party, though. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=236.72s)]
*  This is about your relationship, frankly, with the people who've entrusted you to go [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=238.0s)]
*  and fight for them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=242.92s)]
*  And I think one of the questions that really probably hits home to a lot of people is, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=244.56s)]
*  are you Jewish? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=250.72s)]
*  We've got a letter that your campaign sent out earlier this year which reads as follows. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=252.04s)]
*  As a proud American Jew, I've been to Israel numerous times for educational, business, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=256.94s)]
*  and leisurely trips. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=262.24s)]
*  You said there in that letter that you are, quote, a proud American Jew. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=263.88s)]
*  How do you explain that? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=268.74s)]
*  My heritage is Jewish. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=272.4s)]
*  I've always identified as Jewish. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  I was raised a practicing Catholic. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  I think I've gone through this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=276.96s)]
*  Even I've not being raised a practicing Jew, I've always joked with friends in circles, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=279.12s)]
*  even with in the campaign, I'd say, guys, I'm Jewish. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  Remember, I was raised Catholic. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  So look, I understand everybody wants to nitpick at me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=289.2s)]
*  I'm going to reassure this once and for all. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm not a facade. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=296.24s)]
*  I'm not a persona. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=297.24s)]
*  I have an extensive career that I worked really hard to achieve. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  And I'm going to deliver from my experience because I remain committed in delivering results [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=302.66s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=306.42s)]
*  I campaigned on inflation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=307.42s)]
*  I campaigned on crime. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=308.42s)]
*  I campaigned on education. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=309.58000000000004s)]
*  I campaigned on delivering resolve for the American people. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=311.14000000000004s)]
*  That's what the people of the third congressional district heard me on and on as I campaigned. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=314.22s)]
*  Now it's going to be incumbent upon me to deliver on those results. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=318.62s)]
*  And I look forward to servicing and serving my district. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  I look forward to serving my people and my district to make sure that they see that this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=326.66s)]
*  is what— [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=330.66s)]
*  The results that people are looking for are called into question when you tell blatant [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=332.66s)]
*  lies, not embellishments. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=338.18s)]
*  And this is, I think, one of the biggest concerns, Congressman-elect, is that you don't really [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  seem to be taking this seriously. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=343.70000000000005s)]
*  You've apologized. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=345.8s)]
*  You said you've made mistakes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=346.8s)]
*  But you've outright lied. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=347.92s)]
*  A lie is not an embellishment on a resume. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=349.3s)]
*  You said you worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=351.82000000000005s)]
*  But they've said, we've got no record of this guy working for us. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  You've said you've gone to and graduated from these universities. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=357.54s)]
*  But they've said, well, we've got no record of that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=360.46s)]
*  These are blatant lies. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=362.88s)]
*  And it calls into question how your constituents and the American people can believe anything [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=363.88s)]
*  that you may say when you are standing on the floor of the House of Representatives, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=368.88s)]
*  supposedly fighting for them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  That's the real issue here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=375.34s)]
*  Well, look, and I agree with what you're saying. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=377.06s)]
*  And as I stated and I continue, we can debate my resume and how I worked with firms such [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=381.06s)]
*  as Goldman and Citigroup. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=387.5s)]
*  Is it debatable or is it just false? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=388.5s)]
*  No, it's very debatable. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=391.06s)]
*  Is it debatable or is it just false? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=392.06s)]
*  No, no, it's not false at all. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=393.06s)]
*  It's debatable. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=395.78s)]
*  I can sit down and explain to you what you can do in private equity, in capital intro, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=396.78s)]
*  via servicing, limited partners and general partners. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=401.94s)]
*  And we can have this discussion that's going to go way above the American people's head. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=404.58s)]
*  But that's not what I campaigned on. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=407.9s)]
*  I campaigned on delivering results for the American people by lowering inflation. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=409.18s)]
*  I can sit down. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=414.14s)]
*  And if you want to have that discussion, I'd be glad to, Tulsi, to explain that to you [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=415.14s)]
*  and make sure that we settle the score. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=418.82s)]
*  This is not about settling scores. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=422.58000000000004s)]
*  And I think you just you just kind of highlighted, I think, my concern, the concern that people [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=424.38s)]
*  at home have. You're saying that this discussion will go way above the heads of the American [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=428.38s)]
*  people, basically insulting their intelligence. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=432.66s)]
*  So not only are you now that's not what I'm saying that you've told, but you're saying [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=435.98s)]
*  that you can't explain it in a way that your constituents would actually be able to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=440.94s)]
*  I can explain it in a way that these lies are debatable. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  If you give me the time, I can easily give that if you give me the time, I can easily [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=447.62s)]
*  explain it for you as in when investors are looking for capital and I'm sitting there [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=452.1s)]
*  doing due diligence on the on the appetite and what they're looking for. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=458.26s)]
*  Right. And we work alongside GPs and LPs to help them place this capital. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=462.82s)]
*  This is what I was doing. And that's when I worked extensively with these firms and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=468.06s)]
*  many other firms at my time as I was vice president of Linkbridge Investors. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=471.5s)]
*  So this isn't this isn't a made up narrative, but I feel like nobody really wants to sit [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  down and talk about it. Everybody just wants to push me and call me a liar. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=480.46s)]
*  Look, I am. Congressman Alex Santos, I did. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=484.21999999999997s)]
*  Congressman Alex Santos, we've given you a lot of time. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=488.02s)]
*  I think the time that is owed is to the people of New York's third. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=490.85999999999996s)]
*  It's hard to imagine how they could possibly trust your explanations when you're not really [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=495.74s)]
*  even willing to admit the depth of your deception to them. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=500.58000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here and joining us. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sC1Ha2JwU&t=504.66s)]
