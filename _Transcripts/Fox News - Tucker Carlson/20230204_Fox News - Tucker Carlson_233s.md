# Kamala Harris impersonator teaches Tucker how to cackle
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM)
*  So all politicians have people who imitate them, who do impressions of them. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is one of the few who really doesn't, and that's because Kamala Harris [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=5.9s)]
*  herself is doing a Kamala Harris impression. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=10.42s)]
*  There is no actual Kamala Harris. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=12.88s)]
*  And so it's kind of a meta question. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=15.6s)]
*  It's very tough. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=16.6s)]
*  It's very difficult to pull off the rambling incompetence and the cackling. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=17.6s)]
*  But we have searched the entire continent of the United States for someone who can do [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  it, and we have found one. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=25.14s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=26.8s)]
*  Before we get to all that, I am Kamala Harris. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=28.2s)]
*  My name is Vice President Kamala Harris, first woman VP. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=32.04s)]
*  My pronouns are she and her. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm a woman sitting at the table wearing a blue suit. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  My pronouns are she and her. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=43.36s)]
*  She fi fo fum. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=47.0s)]
*  I'm wearing a blue suit. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=51.88s)]
*  One of many. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=55.68s)]
*  My pants are Old Navy and school buses are yellow. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  Because think about it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=61.28s)]
*  Yellow school buses are our nation's largest form of mass transit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=62.28s)]
*  Yeah, largest form of mass transit. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=67.8s)]
*  So clearly the impersonator of this story, whose name is Esti, has the kind of faintly [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=71.56s)]
*  hallucinogenic quality down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=77.1s)]
*  But it's the cackle that she really nailed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=79.12s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=82.58s)]
*  Esti, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=83.58s)]
*  The cackle. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=86.4s)]
*  Can you just do that again? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=87.4s)]
*  I think you perfected it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=88.4s)]
*  Hello America. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=89.4s)]
*  I don't know if you live with others, roommate, spouse, friends, whatever. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=96.4s)]
*  When you do that cackle around other people, how do they respond? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=105.24s)]
*  Sometimes they leave the room. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=109.76s)]
*  It really depends on what team they're playing for. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  But for the most part, it turns heads for sure. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=113.8s)]
*  I think I fine-tuned it down to get it to sound just like her. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=115.96s)]
*  Just for masochistic reasons, can you do it one more time? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=120.52s)]
*  It's so perfect. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=123.55999999999999s)]
*  So the State of the Union is coming up next week. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=129.76s)]
*  Do you have a preview for us? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=131.84s)]
*  Well, Tucker, I really want to make sure that we can galvanize our time. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  And when we get there, we want to lead Joe into the passage of time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  Really, we don't want it to be too much into the passage. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  We're going to have a Venn diagram explaining everything. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  And hopefully there will be yellow school buses. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=151.32s)]
*  Does it change the way you feel about yourself that you're able to do something like this? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=157.6s)]
*  Well, it started very, very differently for me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=163.44s)]
*  I downloaded TikTok during the pandemic, like many other very bored Americans, amongst other [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=166.32s)]
*  people around the world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=172.4s)]
*  And one of the followers told me that I had actually sounded like her and I replied to the video. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  And after that, the request just kept on coming in and given her content and all the great, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  wonderful speeches that she's given. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  I haven't run out of any content yet. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  So no, and you never will be upon her. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=188.4s)]
*  We're going to go out of this with an actual camel, a camel, a camel, whatever, cackle, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  just so our viewers can see how perfect your imitation is. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  Esti, thank you so much. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=200.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  And here's the real thing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=202.8s)]
*  And we misspoke, of course, with Kamala Harris. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=215.08s)]
*  There is no real thing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=217.08s)]
*  She's doing an impression of herself, but whatever. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  You see the point. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=220.8s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THe1JWz38rM&t=221.8s)]
