# Tucker taste tests chocolate covered crickets
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY)
*  So what is this new bug food gonna look like? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, here it is. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=3.04s)]
*  Hey, my name is Chef Joseph Yoon, Edible Insect Ambassador, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=6.4s)]
*  and we work to raise awareness and appreciation for sustainable forms of protein. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=10.4s)]
*  How can we sustainably feed the growing population around the world? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=16.4s)]
*  And it doesn't suggest that we want to get rid of anything. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=22.8s)]
*  How do we add something to our diets and maybe look towards the past for solutions for the future? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=27.36s)]
*  They're incredibly nutritious, they're sustainable, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=34.64s)]
*  but most importantly, they can be prepared absolutely deliciously. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  So as long as we're switching from ribeye to cicadas, we might as well make it good. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=49.12s)]
*  Chef Joseph Yoon is trying his best to do that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=53.44s)]
*  He's the executive director of Brooklyn Bugs, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=56.0s)]
*  an organization that without any shame at all promotes bug food. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=58.64s)]
*  He joins us on set now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=63.04s)]
*  Chef Yoon, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=64.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=66.72s)]
*  So we're assuming, leaving politics aside, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  we're just assuming for the purpose of the segment, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=69.6s)]
*  this is just inevitable, we're gonna be eating bugs, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=71.2s)]
*  so we might as well make the best of it, and you have definitely made the best of it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=73.2s)]
*  Tell us what kind of bugs you cook. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=76.56s)]
*  I cook with a lot of different insects, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=79.28s)]
*  and really crickets are like a really big gateway bug, if you will. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=81.6s)]
*  And I will. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=86.48s)]
*  One of the really big reasons that we love to highlight this is that it's so fun, it's delicious. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=87.76s)]
*  We can talk about sustainability and everything, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  but if it doesn't taste good, it's not gonna be successful. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=97.52s)]
*  I agree with you completely. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=100.0s)]
*  I don't know what's in a wheat thin, but I'll eat them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=101.2s)]
*  So is there any bug that you won't prepare as food that's too far for you? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=103.2s)]
*  I only work with bugs that I know are scientifically proven to be edible for human consumption. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  A big part is, how can we reimagine edible insects? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=115.28s)]
*  And it's not something that we're trying to force on anybody. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  It's just one option that we have to consider as a food source. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=122.48s)]
*  Before we get into what you prepared today, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  I think everyone has the same question in mind. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=129.36s)]
*  Will cockroaches be on the menu? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=132.08s)]
*  Are they ever prepared, cockroaches? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=133.68s)]
*  All the insects that we use are farmed or harvested specifically for human consumption. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=136.56s)]
*  And cockroaches may be on that list, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  but I personally don't really think that we're ready for cockroaches just yet. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=146.16s)]
*  You speak for me when you say that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm not ready. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=151.92s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=152.64s)]
*  What is that? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  I wanted to bring some sweet and savory. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  And so here we have caramel popcorn and chocolate covered crickets. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=158.64s)]
*  And also a cricket burger. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=165.92s)]
*  Cricket burger. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=168.88s)]
*  Now I'm going to start slowly, like a child would, with the chocolate covered cricket. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=170.0s)]
*  Do you mind if I eat that? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  No, please. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=175.92s)]
*  So that is chocolate covering a cricket? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=177.04s)]
*  Yeah, correct. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  What part of the cricket? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=179.76s)]
*  Well, the legs are shaking off, but it's pretty much the entire cricket. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  Including the loins. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=185.12s)]
*  The loins are included in that piece. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=186.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=189.04s)]
*  That's delicious. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=191.2s)]
*  I love your willingness to try this because it's really just like a psychological thing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=192.24s)]
*  to separate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=198.64s)]
*  This isn't a cricket hopping around the ground. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=199.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=201.36s)]
*  It's a cricket that was farmed and harvested for us to eat. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=201.76s)]
*  I'll put anything in my mouth, Chef. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=204.0s)]
*  So... [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=205.28s)]
*  I have no limits. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=205.84s)]
*  Tell me what... [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=206.8s)]
*  That's a cricket caramel popcorn. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=207.6s)]
*  We got crickets in there and like, you know, we can... [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=209.2s)]
*  If we could just think about presenting this as food that we already recognize, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  we could have extreme dishes that highlights like that super bug-ified. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=216.88s)]
*  But what about ways that are a little more familiar for us to try to eat? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=221.04s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=224.4s)]
*  So I just try to give people the options. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm not trying to force this on anybody. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=226.72s)]
*  No, I get it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=228.32s)]
*  I get it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  And it's really like, hey, if you want to try it, I'd love to share this with you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=229.6s)]
*  If you don't, then I'm also very fine with that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=233.2s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'd eat chocolate covered crickets all day. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=235.44s)]
*  Let's take that to the bank. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, I'm not going to eat this right now because it's... [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=239.2s)]
*  Frankly, it's too early here in Los Angeles for me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  But can you tell us what that is? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=244.64s)]
*  That just looks like a hamburger. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a cricket burger that we form late. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=247.84s)]
*  And it's not 100% cricket, like a beef burger, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=251.04s)]
*  because we need to fill it with like other things to give it the mouth feel, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=253.68s)]
*  the texture of a real burger. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=257.68s)]
*  Can you be a little more specific about these other things? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=259.44s)]
*  So we use like soy and like aromatics, like onions and garlic. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=261.2s)]
*  And we also use like different sort of like yeast, like the yeast. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=265.76s)]
*  And it really just kind of like gives it like a nice mouth feel and flavor. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=270.24s)]
*  I'm just going to... [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=276.08s)]
*  I'm going to smell it and then I'm just going to nibble on it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=276.72s)]
*  Okay, you know what? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  If eating together kind of helps... [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=280.24s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm just... [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=283.92s)]
*  I trust you so much. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=284.48s)]
*  Forget the morning time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=285.44000000000005s)]
*  You're the first bug chef I've ever met. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm just going to go ahead and do it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=288.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=289.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=290.0s)]
*  Bug appetit. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=290.24s)]
*  That's not bad at all. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  It's actually pretty good. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  Roughly, I'm not going to hold you to it, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=295.36s)]
*  but how many crickets per burger would you say? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, in this burger, we have... [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=300.24s)]
*  It's mostly the powder that I use. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=302.0s)]
*  And each one has probably like about one tablespoon, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=304.56s)]
*  which is one to two tablespoons of cricket powder. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=308.08s)]
*  And how many crickets does that represent? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=311.52s)]
*  That I'd have to get back to you on. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know exactly how many. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  And I assume they're humanely killed. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=316.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=318.08s)]
*  Okay, I'm not going to ask for details on that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay. Chef Yun, if anybody can sell this country on bugs, it's you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbS684TbyTY&t=320.48s)]
