# Tony Bobulinski reacts to Biden's voicemail to son Hunter: 'That's staggering'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs)
*  What's amazing in retrospect is that two years ago, when this story first broke, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=0.0s)]
*  the usual liars and power worshipers in the media, those of whom the rare few [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=4.8s)]
*  who even acknowledged that Tony Bobulinski existed, dismissed the story [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=9.64s)]
*  by saying, well, yeah, but it's Biden's son and nothing to do with Biden. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=13.96s)]
*  As if Hunter Biden would be able to make millions of dollars [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=19.04s)]
*  in, say, Ukraine or China on the basis of his own expertise, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=22.16s)]
*  which amounted to precisely nothing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=25.44s)]
*  He never had a real job. He had no skills. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=27.36s)]
*  How was he getting so rich? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=29.48s)]
*  Because his dad was the vice president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  That's how they were selling access to the United States government [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=32.04s)]
*  with Joe Biden's brother. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=35.52s)]
*  And the money was in part going to Joe Biden. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=36.84s)]
*  And that was all very clear because Hunter Biden said it repeatedly on text [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  that any news organization could have read. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  But Tony Bobulinski already knew that because he saw that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=45.44s)]
*  he'd already met with Joe Biden directly. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=48.96s)]
*  So we asked him again about this, put some flesh on those bones. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=53.28s)]
*  And he did. Watch. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=56.68000000000001s)]
*  Your business partners with Hunter and Jim Biden, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=59.96s)]
*  Joe Biden's son and brother. Correct. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=63.12s)]
*  Both of them, Hunter Biden has received some coverage for his art. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  I call it the Biden family, because, as you know, it's been well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=70.48s)]
*  Well, I say well documented, you well documented it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=73.52s)]
*  But I met with Joe multiple times and now subsequent to the election. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=76.6s)]
*  He's now the sitting president of the United States. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=82.0s)]
*  But there are hundreds of data points [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=84.16s)]
*  that Joe Biden was acting in. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=87.28s)]
*  In a capitalistic term, I would say the chairman, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=91.28s)]
*  the chairman of JP Morgan doesn't take eight meetings down with the people, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=94.24s)]
*  you know, analyzing companies. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=99.16s)]
*  The chairman serves a purpose, right? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=100.44s)]
*  He's a figurehead. He shows up in meetings, shakes hands, advises, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=102.08s)]
*  you know, has faith in his team. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=106.36s)]
*  Effectively, that was Joe Biden's role in the Biden family business ventures [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=108.28s)]
*  and around the world and not just my venture. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=112.92s)]
*  I met with him multiple times. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=115.72s)]
*  I think it was the Daily Mail that made a recording public [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  where Joe Biden reaches out to Hunter Biden in December 2018 [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=121.64s)]
*  after The New York Times had published a extensive article [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=127.36s)]
*  on CFC, Chairman Yee and how they were deploying billions of dollars [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=131.92s)]
*  around the world with different governance, governments basically acting [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=137.44s)]
*  as the capitalistic arm of one belt, one road. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=141.44s)]
*  So I'd like to play that voicemail. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=144.04s)]
*  This is from the sitting president of the United States. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  This is from Joe Biden to his son, Hunter. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  Hey, pal, it's dad. It's 8 15. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=151.6s)]
*  On Wednesday night, you get a chance to make a call. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  Nothing urgent. Just want to talk to you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=158.67999999999998s)]
*  I thought the article released online is going to be printed tomorrow. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  And the times was good. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you're clear. And anyway, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  if we get a chance to make a call, I love it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=171.96s)]
*  I mean, that's it. That's staggering. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=174.36s)]
*  The sitting president of the United States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=177.12s)]
*  That's Joe Biden in his own voice telling the American people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=180.24s)]
*  I was always well aware of the business ventures my family was involved in. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=183.52s)]
*  So much so I could tell my son. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  I read a detailed article that has 50 facts in it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=190.88s)]
*  Imagine just sitting in a room with national security [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=194.56s)]
*  and the intelligence agencies with that article talking about corruption, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=197.92s)]
*  talking about China, talking about the Chinese Communist Party, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=201.88s)]
*  the Liberation Army of China. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=205.2s)]
*  Joe Biden is saying, I read that article and you're in the clear, Hunter. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=209.56s)]
*  And he leaves that voicemail for his son. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  So do you think that the Bidens were aware [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  of the effects on the United States of doing business with China? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=220.76s)]
*  It's funny, I think in their mind, they view Russia as a bigger threat than China. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=225.08s)]
*  They sort of talk and operate like that, which was always surprising to me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  But I think they're well aware of it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  The magnitude, you know, Hunter, in his own words, talks about being in business [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  with the spy chief of China. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=242.52s)]
*  Did you ever talk to Hunter Biden directly about this? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=243.88000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, I was aware of what was being done in 2015 and 2016. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  By James Gillier and Rob Walker with the Chinese company CFC, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=252.8s)]
*  while Joe Biden was still the sitting vice president of the United States. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=256.36s)]
*  There was a text message where I was early on having discussions with Hunter about, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, what is CFC focused on and Chairman Yee? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=265.2s)]
*  Are they doing any deal or what kind of deals? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  And Hunter in a very long text message says, you know, we're willing to do any deals, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=271.92s)]
*  except I think he excluded, you know, military tech and the intelligence agencies. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=276.92s)]
*  You know, military tech that would give the Chinese military an advantage over the United States military. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  But outside of that, they were ready and willing to do any other deal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  So you said they viewed Russia and it's clearly true that they do as a bigger threat than China [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  and as someone who has worked around the world. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=297.32s)]
*  You think that's ludicrous. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  But they were also willing to do business deals with Russia, correct? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=300.64s)]
*  They were. They were. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  And there's a very well documented, you know, Senator Johnson and Senator Grassley. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=306.48s)]
*  And sadly enough, it came out after the election. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=312.0s)]
*  But they, you know, they initially published a report in September 2020. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=314.96s)]
*  Two weeks after the election in November 2020, they published a 70 page document [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=319.68s)]
*  that's publicly available to anybody that's watching this, that wants to to to to review it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=324.44s)]
*  That goes through in detail the involvement of Hunter Biden and the Biden family [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=329.96s)]
*  with knowledge of a deal that was being struck between CFC buying a nine billion dollar stake [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=334.92s)]
*  in the U.S. sanctioned Russian controlled by Putin energy company and writing a nine billion dollar check. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=342.6s)]
*  They weren't a silent partner. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=352.12s)]
*  And, you know, we're going to put nine million or 90 million or 900 million. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=353.6s)]
*  They were buying a nine billion dollar stake, approximately 14 percent of Rosneft. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=358.28s)]
*  Once again, U.S. sanctioned Putin controlled Russian energy company. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=364.76s)]
*  And Hunter Biden and the Biden family were right in the middle of all of that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=369.84s)]
*  Have you had any contact with Hunter or Jim Biden? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  No, the last. So the last contact I had with the Biden family is actually when I was in my interview [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=376.12s)]
*  with the with the FBI on October 23rd for that five plus hours on my BlackBerry, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=381.6s)]
*  Jim Biden called me via WhatsApp and, you know, I was there voluntarily. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=388.04s)]
*  But so my phone starts ringing in the middle of this interview. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=392.88s)]
*  So I looked down and I'm like, I'm like, is he really calling me right now? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=395.64s)]
*  So I show the phone to my lawyer and he's like, and then I showed to the agents, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=400.96s)]
*  the agents got up out of their chair and left the room. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=405.72s)]
*  They were like, you can take that call if you want. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=408.16s)]
*  And so I answered it and there was nobody on the other side. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=410.32s)]
*  So I don't know if it was a mistake or they were trying to send me a message or what it was. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=413.68s)]
*  But that's the last interaction or communication I've had with the Biden family. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=418.96s)]
*  So you are the key to the story and there's a lot at stake. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=423.0s)]
*  I wish I wasn't. Of course, you didn't choose it, obviously, but you are. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=427.6s)]
*  And there's an awful lot at stake. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=433.04s)]
*  Are you concerned about what the consequences might be for you and your family? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=434.76s)]
*  Yeah, of course. I mean, I have a. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  My immediate family, my extended family, I'm concerned about. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  But the good news is they're all patriots. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=450.64s)]
*  You know, we all bleed red, white and blue. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=452.36s)]
*  We believe in this country, the greatest country in the world, hands down. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=454.68s)]
*  And these facts matter. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=458.2s)]
*  I don't matter if the facts matter. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=460.12s)]
*  And the American people deserve to know them and and verify them [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=462.92s)]
*  and ask their senators and congressmen to verify them and ultimately [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=467.48s)]
*  hold the Biden family and the current administration accountable for them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=471.64s)]
*  Imagine this to this day, two years, Joe Biden is yet to be asked, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=475.64s)]
*  did he ever meet with me? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=479.08s)]
*  Not one time, not one time. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=482.12s)]
*  So we've had two years to look into you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=484.08s)]
*  We looked into you before our first interview. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=487.6s)]
*  And I should say this because I think our viewers should know, you know, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=489.92s)]
*  we've interviewed a lot of whistleblowers. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=492.6s)]
*  I have over 30 years more than and, you know, a lot of them [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  telling the truth, probably most, but almost all of them want something. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=498.20000000000005s)]
*  And we can say because we verified it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=501.92s)]
*  You're not actually looking for anything. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=504.36s)]
*  You don't need the money, that's for sure. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=505.64000000000004s)]
*  That's only downside for you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=507.88s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons we were confident enough [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=510.12s)]
*  in you to do a second interview. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=512.32s)]
*  Why are you coming out now again? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=514.2s)]
*  I'm coming out now because American people still are being lied to about the facts. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=517.12s)]
*  Right. Nothing's been done. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=521.92s)]
*  They're still thinking, oh, that deal never happened or, you know, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=524.12s)]
*  Hunter Biden was a troubled child. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=527.68s)]
*  They're not aware of the tens of millions of dollars, the thousands of, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, pages of documentation and the facts. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  The DOJ is claiming they're going to they had to couch this. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=535.64s)]
*  They can't do anything near an election. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=538.4s)]
*  I don't want to be sitting here in December. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=540.36s)]
*  And they actually indict Hunter Biden. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=542.36s)]
*  And then the American people are like, why weren't we made aware of those facts? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=544.88s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=548.36s)]
*  I would have changed my vote for that congressman or that senator [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=549.64s)]
*  or that governor or that attorney general. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=552.4799999999999s)]
*  So that's why I'm coming out now. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  And as I referenced earlier, I came back from summer travel [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=557.88s)]
*  to find out that the person that was running point on the trove of documents [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=561.92s)]
*  and text messages that were provided to the FBI just suddenly retired [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=565.56s)]
*  and walked out of the building. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  Does it mean you've got the most powerful agencies in the world, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=571.28s)]
*  the FBI and the CIA working against you? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=575.88s)]
*  That's not an overstatement. We've seen it happen. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=581.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that just made my heart skip. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=583.64s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=585.2399999999999s)]
*  And that's quite an array of opponents. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=586.52s)]
*  Red, white and blue. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=590.16s)]
*  Greatest country on the face of the earth. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=591.3599999999999s)]
*  I believe facts matter and the truth ultimately will come out. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=594.16s)]
*  You hear that? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  He just said that Joe Biden's brother called him while he was talking to the FBI. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=600.28s)]
*  How would Joe Biden's brother know he was talking to the FBI? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=604.64s)]
*  Who's running the FBI? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=607.92s)]
*  Well, his name is Chris Ray. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=609.24s)]
*  We now know that the FBI suppressed the story. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=611.32s)]
*  They never called Bobulinski back, never did a second interview. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  And then they called the social media companies to censor it, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  to influence the outcome of a presidential election. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  Has that ever happened? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=625.12s)]
*  Why is this man still running the FBI? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=627.24s)]
*  Why has no one asked him about it? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  We'll hear from Carlson tonight. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ecunqXdVs&t=639.2s)]
