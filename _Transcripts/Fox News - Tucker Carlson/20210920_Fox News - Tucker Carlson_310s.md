# Tucker reveals the most pressing question for Americans about the border crisis
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko)
*  We've been saying for months that our southern border is out of control, that it's completely open. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=0.0s)]
*  Just in case you think we've been overstating that, here's this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=5.44s)]
*  More than 13,000 Haitians have now crossed into Del Rio, Texas. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=8.96s)]
*  Our own Bill Mollugian has been on the story like nobody else. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=14.64s)]
*  He was there on Saturday. Here's part of what he saw. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=17.52s)]
*  What you're looking at right now is that is the U.S. side of the Rio Grande. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=20.72s)]
*  That is a mass of several hundred illegal immigrants who have just crossed the Rio Grande. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  And look at this. Several hundred more streaming across as we speak. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=29.36s)]
*  We're on a boat in the Rio Grande. This is the Mexican side of the river right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=32.88s)]
*  You can see it's a never-ending stream. Hundreds of people crossing the Rio Grande, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=37.6s)]
*  basically every hour. And they're heading over to the International Bridge, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=43.2s)]
*  which you can see in the background. Look at that mass of people. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=46.72s)]
*  This is why the situation under the bridge continues to deteriorate. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=50.64s)]
*  This is insane. The federal government has to wake up. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  So a lot of questions here. Where do these Haitians come from? How did they get here? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=59.76s)]
*  How did they afford it? But most pressing of all for Americans is where are these Haitians going? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=64.48s)]
*  U.S. Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz just told Mollugian that of the 12,000 migrants under the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=70.64s)]
*  bridge in Del Rio, only adult men will be deported. Yeah, right. The rest will be processed and released [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=76.88s)]
*  into what you thought was your country, but turns out isn't. Today, Fox News' Peter Ducey asked the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  White House what our borders are, thinks about all of this. Where's the Vice President on any [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=88.4s)]
*  of this? Isn't she supposed to be addressing the root causes of migration? Absolutely. And she has [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=94.0s)]
*  been addressing the root causes of migration by working with countries in the region to ensure [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  they have the assistance they need to reduce the number of people who are coming and trying to make [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  those journeys across the border. We've actually seen some reductions in some of those numbers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=107.76s)]
*  That doesn't change the fact that this is a very challenging situation in Del Rio. We're working to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  implement our policies and we're working to ensure we are also addressing their causes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=116.48s)]
*  So why does our guy have to wear the obedience mask and that woman doesn't? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=122.16s)]
*  So many questions. Somebody who can answer a lot of those questions is Laura Logan, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  host of the Laura Logan Has No Agenda Show on Fox Nation, which is excellent. She joins us tonight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Laura, thanks so much for coming on. So how do these people get here? Where are they going? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=135.28s)]
*  Do you know? Well, you know, what's interesting about these people, Tucker, is that based on what [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=139.84s)]
*  they're telling border patrol agents when they're interviewed, many of them, in fact, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=144.88s)]
*  if not most of them, have come from Chile and Brazil and countries like that. They're not [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=149.2s)]
*  actually coming from Haiti because they've been living in Latin American countries ever since the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  earthquake. So that's years now. And what they are saying is that the border is wide open. Everybody [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=159.2s)]
*  knows it's wide open. The message is loud and clear. They've seen people crossing there for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=166.0s)]
*  months. The Biden administration doesn't do anything. And this is their chance. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=169.92s)]
*  So they said their lives are pretty good. I've seen many of them in the airports here as they're [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=174.64s)]
*  cycled through and distributed all over this country. And they're well dressed and, you know, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=179.44s)]
*  very lovely people from what I can tell, you know, well behaved, great families. But what they don't [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  look like is desperate. They don't look like, for example, Christians fleeing persecution from [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=189.92s)]
*  Nigeria who are actually in the midst of a genocide who cannot even get asylum in this country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=194.72s)]
*  But the asylum laws are actually written for them. And what you're seeing happen here is, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=201.04s)]
*  you know, those thousands of people in the bridge, Tucker, you know what the agents tell me? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=205.92s)]
*  They've got like 24 Portageons for those people. Several hundred of them, like around 300, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=209.76s)]
*  escaped on Sunday morning. They just ran away. The conditions are miserable. They don't have enough [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=215.76s)]
*  food. They don't have any real facilities or security. It is an absolute unmitigated [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=220.88s)]
*  disaster. And what you're seeing happen here is all those people in the Biden administration [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=226.72s)]
*  that came from the Open Society Foundation that we're not allowed to talk about because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=232.0s)]
*  that'll be the end of us, right? They'll come for all of us. Well, you know what? Those people, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=236.24s)]
*  those advisors, they don't want a border. What does open society mean? It means no borders, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=240.96s)]
*  which means no America, right? No countries. That's why patriotism and the flag and all of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=247.12s)]
*  those things are so evil today, right? They're automatically white supremacy and nationalism, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=252.96s)]
*  never mind that you can be, you know, an African country and be proud of your flag and your [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=258.72s)]
*  borders, or you can come from Kosovo or wherever. So what you're seeing is part of a much bigger [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=264.0s)]
*  political picture. It's not just about the border. And it's the same strategy as Afghanistan. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Ignore, ignore, ignore, pretend it's not there and not happening. And the biggest thing here, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=275.12s)]
*  Tucker, is that people keep using words like failure. They say, oh, they failed to act. No, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=280.88s)]
*  they chose not to act. They chose not to act because they have the outcome that they want. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=286.0s)]
*  That is such a good point and bless you for making it. Laura Logan, thank you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPCz-PFYiko&t=293.44s)]
