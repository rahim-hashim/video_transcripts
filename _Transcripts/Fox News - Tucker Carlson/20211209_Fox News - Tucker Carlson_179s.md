# Biden chooses 'most unhinged' person possible for DOJ position: Horace Cooper
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E)
*  Horace Cooper is the co-chairman of Project 21. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=2.96s)]
*  Horace, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=4.12s)]
*  So the concern is not that there's a crazy prosecutor [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=5.44s)]
*  out there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  We've honestly seen that before. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=9.24s)]
*  There are crazy people out there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  But if you get enough people like Rachel Rollins, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=12.68s)]
*  all of a sudden, nobody believes in your justice system [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=16.6s)]
*  anymore, and I think that is worth worrying about. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=19.04s)]
*  Oh, I think it's definitely something worth worrying about, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=23.12s)]
*  and I don't think it's an accident. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Black women make up about 7% of the population [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=28.04s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=32.32s)]
*  How is it that we manage to pick one of the most unhinged [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=33.8s)]
*  persons that we could find for this particular position? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=38.72s)]
*  What we're saying is the people that actually hate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=43.92s)]
*  our criminal justice system, the people that hate Americans, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=49.0s)]
*  by the way, it's the victims that these positions [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=54.44s)]
*  are supposed to be the supporters of. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=58.68s)]
*  It is not the attackers, it is the victims. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=61.44s)]
*  If she's worried about the cost of quote, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=65.84s)]
*  housing these people, why doesn't she support stronger, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=70.52s)]
*  stricter, more severe punishments? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=75.72s)]
*  Our framers understood that you are supposed to hold [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=79.36s)]
*  criminal behavior accountable. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=85.32s)]
*  Her vision is the exact opposite of that, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  and what it's going to do is open it up [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=92.28s)]
*  so that people start taking justice for themselves. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=96.28s)]
*  That isn't civilization, that's not progress. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=101.0s)]
*  That's heading in the exact opposite direction. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=104.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that's such a wise, such an insightful thing to say. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=107.16s)]
*  That is the end stage of this, when you see people [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=110.24s)]
*  who have no choice but to administer their own justice, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=114.24s)]
*  and at that point, is that really a civilized society? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=117.32s)]
*  No, of course not, it's back to the Stone Age at that point. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=120.64s)]
*  We absolutely have a person that wants to say [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=125.6s)]
*  she's a first. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=130.32s)]
*  She's a first, all right, unhinged, having to be brokered, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  having the vice president brought in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  to cast the tie-breaking vote. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  This president, it's remarkable. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=141.88s)]
*  He picks Kamala Harris, incompetent, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  he picks this person, unfit, unsuited for this position. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  What is going on, and we should be paying attention [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  because it's pretty serious. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=157.04s)]
*  I think it is serious, especially when it infects [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=158.88s)]
*  the justice system, I think it's really worth [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=162.44s)]
*  paying attention to. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=164.44s)]
*  Horace Cooper, great to see you tonight, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=165.28s)]
*  thank you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRl5hEh685E&t=166.36s)]
