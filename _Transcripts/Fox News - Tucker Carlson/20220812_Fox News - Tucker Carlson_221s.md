# Harmeet Dhillon: 'DOJ is not keen' to share justification behind Trump raid
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY)
*  For more on what today's warrant actually means, we're now going to turn to Harmeet [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=0.0s)]
*  Dhillon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=4.24s)]
*  She is a phenomenal attorney and the chairwoman of the Republican National Lawyers Association. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=5.24s)]
*  Harmeet, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  You have been watching this as it has played out kind of moment by moment. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of these new developments that we've just learned today? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=17.84s)]
*  Well, what we know that has been confirmed by the search warrant being revealed is that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=20.84s)]
*  it was extremely broad, like Shannon just pointed out. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=26.0s)]
*  And what we don't know and what everybody wants to know is what was the justification [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=29.72s)]
*  presented to a federal judge to take this extraordinary step on the part of the United [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=34.48s)]
*  States Department of Justice. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=39.84s)]
*  And so generally speaking, that search warrant affidavit or affidavits are not unsealed until [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=41.32s)]
*  there is an indictment. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=47.84s)]
*  And even then, if there are national security implications, they could be restricted to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=48.84s)]
*  the target of that subpoena and the or the search warrant rather and his attorneys. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  And so it's going to be a while probably before we see that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=58.68s)]
*  And I suspect that the Department of Justice is not keen to reveal exactly why they took [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  this step. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=67.88s)]
*  But what we can also say is that a federal magistrate judge does have the ability and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=68.88s)]
*  in fact, I think the duty to cut back on a subpoena that seems overbroad for the circumstances. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=74.48s)]
*  Now, in reality, they often just rubber stamp them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=80.2s)]
*  That's a real problem in our judicial system. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=82.92s)]
*  And I think that's what happened here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=84.92s)]
*  And I really am. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=86.92s)]
*  My mind is blown that this can be a justified search of a former president. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=87.92s)]
*  And so this is deeply troubling for anybody who cares about civil liberties in our country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=92.44s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=97.8s)]
*  Has there been any discussion or what are what possible steps could be taken to explore [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=99.48s)]
*  any potential conflict of interest given this specific judge who approved this warrant, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=105.2s)]
*  given his previous political contributions and kind of political leanings? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=110.72s)]
*  Well, just about every judge these days has some political leanings or contributions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=116.92s)]
*  That itself is not a problem. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=121.52s)]
*  But this specific judge has made specific negative remarks about President Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=123.32s)]
*  And I think they rise to the level of recusal. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=127.56s)]
*  But at this point, after the judge has already issued this ex parte search warrant, which [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  is how it goes, there's really nothing that can be done to unwind that specifically. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=135.28s)]
*  But a party who believes that a search warrant has been executed unlawfully or it is overbroad [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=139.32s)]
*  or what have you, can make certain motions in the criminal system. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  There's Rule Four and there's some other moves that can be made to get the return of this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=148.0s)]
*  evidence. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=152.24s)]
*  But there are many fishy things about this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=153.24s)]
*  So we'll see, including the fact that the government apparently was given access to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=154.76s)]
*  these documents in June and their request to the former president was to put a padlock [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=158.52s)]
*  on the room and everybody went away and thought that this was all under control on the Trump [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=163.36s)]
*  side. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=168.0s)]
*  Suddenly they come in with this sort of librarian-issued SWAT team to take these drastic steps. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=169.08s)]
*  And I think that that is very odd. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=176.68s)]
*  And what it seems to me, and I'm not changing my view based on seeing the search warrant, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=178.52s)]
*  this was a massive phishing expedition to see if they could concoct any evidence of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=182.92s)]
*  anything. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=187.36s)]
*  That is not how warrants are supposed to work in America. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=188.36s)]
*  And that should outrage every civil libertarian. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=191.44s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=193.28s)]
*  This is about so much more than whether or not people support Trump or against Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=195.32s)]
*  This is something that is directly connected to every one of our civil liberties. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=199.16s)]
*  Thank you so much, Harmeet. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  I really appreciate your analysis, as always. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvXY45dyHKY&t=209.07999999999998s)]
