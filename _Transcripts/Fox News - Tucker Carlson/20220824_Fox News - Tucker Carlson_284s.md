# Ron DeSantis blasts Charlie Crist for insulting his voters
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08)
*  Glenn Young can became governor of Virginia last fall. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=0.0s)]
*  No one thought he would. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=2.88s)]
*  He beat a former governor, very well funded. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=4.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Well, the main reason was parents in Virginia, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=7.44s)]
*  like parents everywhere, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=9.84s)]
*  don't actually want teachers indoctrinating their kids [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=11.16s)]
*  with their weird political views [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=13.64s)]
*  because it's creepy as hell and not what school is for. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=14.88s)]
*  Well, voters in Florida sent the same message. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=17.96s)]
*  Last night in Florida, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=20.0s)]
*  Republicans flipped five majority left school districts [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=21.04s)]
*  in big counties, Miami Dade, Sarasota Duval, Martin Clay. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=24.68s)]
*  Miami Dade alone has more than 300,000 students. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=28.72s)]
*  It's one of the biggest school districts in the country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=31.56s)]
*  How this happened, what does it mean? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=33.8s)]
*  Ron DeSantis runs Florida, he's the governor. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=35.12s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=37.56s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=38.4s)]
*  This seems like a big story. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=40.2s)]
*  How this happened and what does it mean? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, we made a concerted effort on these races, Tucker, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  for precisely the reasons you said. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=48.92s)]
*  Parents are seeing what's going on now more than ever. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=50.4s)]
*  So there was a lot of energy and that's important to harness, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=53.2s)]
*  but it's also important to educate other Republican voters [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=56.2s)]
*  who may be your grandparents now, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  or maybe they don't have kids in the house anymore. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  But I think all really understand [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  that we gotta get this education stuff right. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=66.4s)]
*  So we worked hard in 30 different races. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=68.76s)]
*  We ended up winning 25 of the races that I was involved in. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=71.72s)]
*  And as you said, some of that were sweeps [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  to where you have school boards that were majority left, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=77.16s)]
*  now majority right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  Part of the problem that we saw with this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  is you would have red counties, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=83.48s)]
*  but because the school board races [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=85.44s)]
*  under our constitution are nonpartisan, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=87.36s)]
*  the union would back a leftist, fund the leftist, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=89.64s)]
*  and you'd have a left-wing school board [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=92.52s)]
*  representing a conservative county. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=94.36s)]
*  So we have fixed that in many of these places [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  to where these school boards are now gonna be representative [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=99.48s)]
*  of the values of the people that live there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and people weren't paying attention. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=105.08s)]
*  I mean, did you have trouble convincing people [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=107.16s)]
*  that this was worth getting involved in? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=109.68s)]
*  I think a little bit, but what we did, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=112.68s)]
*  we had no other races on the Republican side. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=115.0s)]
*  There was no governor, primary, senate, attorney general. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  This was really it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  We had a handful of legislative races, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  but this is what we told voters were important. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=124.68s)]
*  And I do think that it impacted it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  I think our turnout overall would have been less [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  had there not been this effort with the school board. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=132.52s)]
*  And I think more and more are getting the picture [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  that this is important. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=138.28s)]
*  But I do think as successful as it was, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=140.0s)]
*  this is just step one. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=142.56s)]
*  We're gonna institutionalize this going forward [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=144.16s)]
*  so that we have good candidates running [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  in these school board races as a matter of course. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  And so this is part of how we're educating voters [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=152.36s)]
*  to make sure that we have people on those school boards [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  who wanna educate kids, not indoctrinate kids, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  and that are gonna be reflective of the values [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=161.24s)]
*  of the communities that they serve. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=162.96s)]
*  So I wanna ask you quickly about your race. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  We learned the other day on last Tuesday [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=166.96s)]
*  that Charlie Crist, who beat the zany weed lady [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=169.16s)]
*  he was running against is gonna be your opponent. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=171.48s)]
*  And Crist, a former Republican, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=173.8s)]
*  came out today with a message to your supporters, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=175.28s)]
*  which I want our viewers to see. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=178.88s)]
*  Those who support the governor should stay with them [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=180.32s)]
*  and vote for him, and I don't want your vote. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=182.84s)]
*  If you have that hate in your heart, keep it there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=186.56s)]
*  I want the vote of the people of Florida [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=189.72s)]
*  who care about our state. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=191.6s)]
*  He doesn't want your vote. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=194.68s)]
*  You're morally beneath him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=196.08s)]
*  I've never seen a politician say that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=197.36s)]
*  This is his fifth decade running for office. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  He's a chameleon, typical career politician. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=203.28s)]
*  But you know, Tucker, people support me [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  because I kept the state open and protected their jobs. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=209.24s)]
*  Charlie Crist wanted it locked down. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=212.08s)]
*  So that's not hate in their heart. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=214.28000000000003s)]
*  They're just appreciative that they had a governor [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  who was standing up for them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=217.72000000000003s)]
*  Parents around the state support me [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  because we made sure schools were open [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=221.28000000000003s)]
*  and we're working to make sure they get education, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  not indoctrination. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=224.96s)]
*  That's not hate in their heart. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=226.24s)]
*  They're just appreciative that they have a governor [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=227.68s)]
*  that's fighting for them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=229.72s)]
*  It's kind of weird to see Charlie Crist [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=231.68s)]
*  look down his nose at voters. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=234.16s)]
*  Is there anyone in the state who is more morally suspect [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  than Charlie Crist who's registered to vote [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=239.8s)]
*  that you're aware of? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  I'll tell you what, I would take, yeah, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think you can. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  I think he is not one to be cast in stones. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=249.08s)]
*  And how contemptible it is when he says, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=251.68s)]
*  he claims that he wants to unify Florida. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  He says he wants a Florida for all. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=257.84s)]
*  And then you condemn a majority of the people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=259.8s)]
*  in the state of Florida? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=263.8s)]
*  And the thing about what I've done is, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=264.64s)]
*  we've done issues that people across the spectrum [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=266.48s)]
*  have been able to agree with. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=269.4s)]
*  And that's really what it's all about. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=270.4s)]
*  It's not hating the other side. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=271.84s)]
*  It's trying to have policies that a majority can agree with. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=273.6s)]
*  If you don't support me, you're a hater. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=276.96s)]
*  That doesn't work. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=279.64s)]
*  I hope it doesn't. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=280.48s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=281.92s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8v_13JlG08&t=283.2s)]
