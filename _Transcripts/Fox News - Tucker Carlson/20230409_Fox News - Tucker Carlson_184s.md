# Bee expert warns Tucker about the extinction of bees
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s)
*  So most people see bees as pests and want to kill them as quickly as they can. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=0.0s)]
*  Dennis Langlois of Orlando, Florida has a very different approach. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=5.5s)]
*  He is a humane bee removal expert. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=8.3s)]
*  He's been doing it for more than a decade. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=10.8s)]
*  He's known as the Bee Guy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=12.3s)]
*  He joins us to explain why he takes this approach. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=13.9s)]
*  Dennis, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=16.5s)]
*  Well, I see you're protected. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=18.1s)]
*  So people see bees, they want to spray them with a can of poison and kill them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=20.1s)]
*  Why should they not do that? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=25.7s)]
*  Well, two reasons. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=27.2s)]
*  Number one is, as a homeowner, the last thing you want to do is leave a bee's nest inside your structure. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=28.4s)]
*  It'll cause more problems than you could ever imagine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=33.9s)]
*  And the other reason is because they're honey bees. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=36.9s)]
*  And so rather than having them killed, there's a beekeeper that would happily remove and relocate those bees. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=38.9s)]
*  And we do that all day, every day. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=43.9s)]
*  So how do you, I mean, I'm just assuming that bees don't want to be gentrified and move to a new neighborhood. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=45.9s)]
*  So how do you convince them to leave? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's a physical process. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  So we essentially evict them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  We physically remove their nest, putting it into a beehive. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=62.2s)]
*  And during the process, we use a special vacuum designed to vacuum the bees up and not hurt them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=65.2s)]
*  And once they're brought back to the farm, then we relocate the bees from the vacuum with the nest and put everybody back together and put them to work. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=71.2s)]
*  How mad are they when they get out of the vacuum? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=79.2s)]
*  You'd be surprised at how gentle they are. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=83.2s)]
*  So most of the time we don't have to wear a suit or a veil or any protective clothing during the entire process. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=85.2s)]
*  Because they're just totally defeated. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=91.2s)]
*  Like they got vacuumed at that point, they just give up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=93.2s)]
*  It seems like they should sting you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=95.2s)]
*  No, that's not. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=97.2s)]
*  No, it's just a matter of knowing the insects and keeping them calm. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=99.2s)]
*  How important, and obviously you have a reason to promote bees. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=103.2s)]
*  I'm very pro-bee myself, I'll just say it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=108.2s)]
*  But why are bees important? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=110.2s)]
*  Well, they produce one third of the food we eat, at least. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=114.2s)]
*  And of course they also make honey, which is a sweet, delicious treat everybody enjoys. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=117.2s)]
*  So if any group, if we were to locate any group in the world that produces one third of the food we eat, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=123.2s)]
*  we'd obviously want to treat them like they were private equity barons or hedge fund managers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=130.2s)]
*  Like we'd treat them with a lot of respect. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=134.2s)]
*  But we don't. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=136.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=137.2s)]
*  I would think so. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=138.2s)]
*  I think it's just some people have a fear of bees and their knee-jerk reaction is when they see a nail, they go get a hammer. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=139.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=145.2s)]
*  Or a can of bug spray. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=147.2s)]
*  How much honey do you eat? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=148.2s)]
*  I eat honey every single day, all the time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=151.2s)]
*  Do you really? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=153.2s)]
*  I love it on ice cream. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=154.2s)]
*  Honey on ice cream, but obviously you're wearing a full suit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=156.2s)]
*  We can't really see your outline, but you seem like a pretty slender fit character. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=159.2s)]
*  How do you eat honey every day and maintain your girlish figure? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=164.2s)]
*  I work hard every day. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=169.2s)]
*  I wake up at 5 a.m. and I don't stop until about 6 a.m. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=171.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=174.2s)]
*  Well, you're making the world better. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=175.2s)]
*  Unlike most people, maybe even talk show hosts. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=177.2s)]
*  So Dennis Lenguat, our respect to you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=180.2s)]
*  Thank you for coming on tonight. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX8l-TBy0s&t=182.2s)]
