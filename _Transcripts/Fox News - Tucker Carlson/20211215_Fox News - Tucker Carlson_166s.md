# Media won't ask Kamala Harris about this: Miranda Devine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 15, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs)
*  So Kamala Harris's many flacks, not just at the VP's office, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=0.0s)]
*  but throughout the media, wants you to know that despite being super unpopular, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=3.84s)]
*  she's hard at work. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=7.36s)]
*  The San Francisco Chronicle is reporting that, quote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=8.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris has redecorated the VP's office. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=10.8s)]
*  Here's the meaning behind her choices. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=14.32s)]
*  Now, the first thing you should know is that Kamala Harris has horrible taste. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=16.16s)]
*  Don't let her near your house. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=20.32s)]
*  But the second thing you should know is that only a supine, groveling media [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  could produce coverage like this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=27.12s)]
*  Miranda Devine is a connoisseur of coverage like this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=29.36s)]
*  She mocks it mercilessly at the New York Post. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=32.16s)]
*  She joins us tonight to do the same. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=34.4s)]
*  Miranda, it's so great to see you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  Congrats on your book, by the way, which is just absolutely killing it and deserves to. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=38.08s)]
*  Let me ask you, Kamala Harris redecorating an office [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=43.12s)]
*  and making it uglier is a news story? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=48.16s)]
*  Well, apparently so. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  It's pretty rare to get a one-on-one interview with Kamala Harris. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=55.12s)]
*  And the San Francisco Chronicle, to their great credit, managed to score one. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=58.8s)]
*  But they didn't ask her, apparently, about the border crisis, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=64.0s)]
*  about the two million illegal migrants that have come over under her aegis. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=68.48s)]
*  This is supposed to be something she's fixing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=73.6s)]
*  Apparently, there was nothing to talk about that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=76.4s)]
*  It was all about the shade of blue that she'd repainted the walls. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=78.8s)]
*  She's replaced, apparently, some patterned couches with some pristine white ones. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  And she also, you know, she has a lot of artwork on her walls. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  And so the San Francisco Chronicle went into great detail telling us all about, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=96.72s)]
*  you know, there's a painting called White Daisy Rhapsody behind her desk. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=102.0s)]
*  Wait, can I just ask you a question? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=108.64000000000001s)]
*  She's this feminist leader. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=110.0s)]
*  She's breaking glass ceilings. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=111.2s)]
*  She's inspiring America's women, my daughters. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=112.4s)]
*  And yet the one interview she gives is about interior decorating? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=115.12s)]
*  Yeah, look, it's pretty sexist, really, when you think about it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=120.56s)]
*  She should be up in arms. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=124.64s)]
*  But that's what she's all about. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  She's all about trivia and frivolity. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=128.96s)]
*  And she never wants to talk about anything serious, like the border. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=131.44s)]
*  No plan to visit, no plan to fix it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=135.52s)]
*  It's all about her decor. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Amazing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=140.72s)]
*  Miranda Devine, author of a brand new book on Hunter Biden's laptop, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=142.08s)]
*  the person who was on the story from the beginning. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  The book is killing it and deserves to. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=147.28s)]
*  We recommend it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Miranda Devine, great to see you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=150.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=151.52s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTLCoB8uPs&t=152.88000000000002s)]
