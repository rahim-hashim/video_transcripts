# This 'became a movement': Youngkin
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro)
*  So, if you were to trace a single moment or the race in Virginia changed, we thought, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=0.0s)]
*  well, this isn't really what we expected. That date would be September 28th. That's when Terry [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=4.96s)]
*  McAuliffe announced in public that, actually, he has full control of your kids. You have no [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  right to determine what they learn in school. Watch. I don't think parents should be telling [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=13.92s)]
*  schools what they should teach. You know, I get really tired of everybody running down teachers. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=18.16s)]
*  I love our teachers. And what they have done through COVID, these are real heroes that deserve [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=23.44s)]
*  our respect. So, we have spent last night and tonight telling you why we think Glenn Youngkin [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=28.16s)]
*  won, which is an amazing feat. If you ask anybody who covers this stuff for a living last year, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=34.88s)]
*  is Glenn Youngkin going to be the next governor of Virginia? Precisely Zero would have said yes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=39.6s)]
*  No, nobody. But he won anyone. He won by a real margin. So, we've told you why we think he won. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=43.04s)]
*  We're going to now ask him. Glenn Youngkin will be the next governor of the Commonwealth of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=48.32s)]
*  Virginia, and we're delighted to have him join us now. Glenn Youngkin, thank you very much. Why [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=52.16s)]
*  do you think you pulled off what I think anyone would agree was an amazing feat last night? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=56.32s)]
*  Well, Tucker, first of all, thank you for having me back. And this campaign stopped being a campaign [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=63.84s)]
*  a while ago, and it became a movement. And yes, it all started in Loudoun County many, many, many [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=69.76s)]
*  months ago. But parents across Virginia started to recognize that they really did need to have [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=75.28s)]
*  a important, decisive role in their children's education. And when they heard Terry McAuliffe [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  say exactly what you just played, that parents don't have a role in their kids' education, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  he wants to put government between parents and their children, this ceased to be a campaign, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=92.4s)]
*  and it started to be a movement led by parents. And while the kitchen table issues that are so [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=97.12s)]
*  important to all Virginians, low taxes and safe communities and great jobs, continued to be very [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  much front and center, education really did become the top issue in this election. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=108.08s)]
*  But you took it at one point, I was really struck by this, you took it to a spiritual level, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=113.12s)]
*  which I don't know if what your advisors thought of this, but you said flat out, we are all equal [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=117.6s)]
*  in the eyes of God. That's the root of our equality. We're judged equally by God because [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=122.8s)]
*  we're created by God. What, and bless you for saying that because it's true, what did your [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=126.24s)]
*  advisors think when you said that? Well, Tucker, I don't run everything by my advisors is what I [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=130.48s)]
*  believe. And it's one of the reasons why I got into this race is because I think there's a moment [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=137.44s)]
*  where we need to speak the truth. And at this time, I think so many people are trying to divide us [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=143.6s)]
*  and tell one group that they should be different than another, and it's time for us to come [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=149.44s)]
*  together. And as I traveled around this great Commonwealth of Virginia that I feel so blessed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  to represent going forward, what I heard from folks from all walks of life, no matter where they are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=158.32s)]
*  in life, is that they were tired of the divisiveness and it was time for us to come together. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=164.96s)]
*  And here we have in our schools a moment to stop teaching our children about their differences and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=169.36s)]
*  start teaching them about the things that can bring us together and prepare them for a great life. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=174.8s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do in our schools when I'm governor is get our kids ready to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  actually go reach after the Virginia promise that we're going to make available to all kids in Virginia. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=182.88s)]
*  May, you've such a huge job. I've never seen a state move as quickly in one direction as [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=188.08s)]
*  Virginia has under the last two governors. I mean, are you ready for this, your task ahead? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=191.76s)]
*  Well, Tucker, we spent the whole day today getting ready. I mean, we got up and went to work. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=200.0s)]
*  And this is what we have to do, Tucker. I've been trained to work in real people time, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  not government time. And so we're already getting ready to start moving. And everybody [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=210.64s)]
*  knows our day one plan is about getting taxes down and getting our schools focused back on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=215.12s)]
*  educating our children, making our communities safe and getting our job machine crank back up. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=220.4s)]
*  But I was really overwhelmed by the by the broad support across the entire Commonwealth of Virginia. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=224.72s)]
*  I mean, we had help from everybody. We had a huge support from the Latino community. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, the president made a call and asked everybody to get out and vote. And we had big [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=236.08s)]
*  turnout in southwest Virginia. We saw parents turnout. We were endorsed by the Hampton Roads [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=240.32s)]
*  Black Caucus. And we did better in the minority communities than I think any Republicans done in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=245.36s)]
*  a long time. This is how we bring people together focused on these most important issues. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=249.84s)]
*  And I just want to thank Virginia for hiring me to go to work for you. And I'm going to give it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=255.28s)]
*  everything I got. We're all created by God. It turns out that's a message people like because, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=259.04s)]
*  again, it's true. Glen Yonkin, I really appreciate your coming on tonight. And again, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=263.68s)]
*  congratulations on a remarkable. This is the moment when people say enough. So thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=268.0s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. And I hope you have a blessed night. Thank you. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPOP2Oirro&t=274.24s)]
