# Why has media ignored aftermath of Waukesha attack?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA)
*  Well, it seems like the world has already forgotten about the mass murder that just took place in Waukesha, Wisconsin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=0.0s)]
*  The Biden administration finally decided to pretend to notice they sent the first lady and the second gentleman down to pay their respects two weeks after the murders. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  So why have our leaders and our media been ignoring what happened in Waukesha right after the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=15.94s)]
*  Sean Duffy is a former congressman from the state of Wisconsin. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=22.52s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=25.7s)]
*  Sean, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=27.12s)]
*  This just inherently mass murder is always a big deal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=28.56s)]
*  Why is this one being ignored? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=31.72s)]
*  Well, first let me just say I appreciate you coming to this story Tucker for Wisconsin, but also Waukesha is a great community. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=33.0s)]
*  They have great schools. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=38.04s)]
*  They go to church on Sunday. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=39.16s)]
*  They love the Packers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=40.2s)]
*  It's a place you want to raise your family, right? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=41.16s)]
*  But I think you have to look at the facts of the case, right? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=43.16s)]
*  So you have Waukesha, I'd say mostly white, mostly Christian, Republican leaning county. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  So they're the wrong race, wrong religion, wrong politics. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=49.28s)]
*  Number one. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=52.36s)]
*  But number two, Darrell Brooks, Jr., the defendant. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  He is black. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=55.64s)]
*  He's anti-white, anti-Jew, anti-Trump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  He gets in his SUV, drives it down a Christmas parade route, Tucker, and kills dancing grannies and an eight year old boy injures 60 people. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  And here's the problem with the story is that he has a rap sheet 50 pages long and he's out on a thousand dollars bail. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=68.52s)]
*  And so the media looks at that and says, well, listen, we're supporting criminal justice reform and bail reform. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=74.64s)]
*  And we've also said that all the white people, I'm sorry, all the racists are like Kyle Rittenhouse, Trump supporters. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=80.12s)]
*  Those are the racists. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=85.76s)]
*  It can't be Darrell Brooks, Jr. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=86.92s)]
*  who's a black man who hates white people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=88.48s)]
*  So we can't cover the story. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=90.44s)]
*  They totally ice it out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=91.64s)]
*  And because they don't want to be confronted with these facts of good people being mowed down by a really bad man and frankly, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  a guy who should have been locked up in jail or not released on bail. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=99.64s)]
*  You know, I just can't think of a more precise or accurate way to describe it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=103.64s)]
*  I don't think you're reading that off the screen. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=107.64s)]
*  I'm impressed by how concisely you put it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  Look, I don't want to divide the country any more than it already is, particularly along color lines. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=111.84s)]
*  But the disparity between the way this is covered and the Rittenhouse trial is covered, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=116.44s)]
*  you just feel like the media have no credibility at all, like literally at all anymore. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=120.72s)]
*  But quickly, I mean, if you look at it, you go, how do they cover the Russia collusion hulks and BLM and the January 6th insurrection? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=126.04s)]
*  But they don't cover the Hunter Biden laptop story and they don't cover this story. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=134.2s)]
*  Right. So they're just hacks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  And you wonder why their ratings are so low or why people don't trust the media. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  It's because, I mean, they are and you've mentioned this, it's an outlet for the Democrat Party, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=141.76s)]
*  the radical wing of the liberals that they support. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=145.88s)]
*  And that's the story as they tell. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=149.12s)]
*  But you know what? I think people want to know the story. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  And frankly, we should know the story to decide, do we really want bail reform? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=152.76s)]
*  Do we really want criminal justice? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=156.68s)]
*  Is this a really good thing for America? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=158.56s)]
*  What are the consequences of these policies on the American people? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  We should know that, but they won't share it so we don't know we're still in the dark. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=164.76s)]
*  Man, that's again so nicely described. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=169.0s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think most fair people agree with what you just said. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=172.28s)]
*  Sean Duffy, thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCY2-AE5CA&t=175.07999999999998s)]
