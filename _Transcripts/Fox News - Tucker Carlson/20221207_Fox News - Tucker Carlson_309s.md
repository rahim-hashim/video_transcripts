# Military official bullied me over sex education: Concerned mom
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM)
*  So a few days ago, a mother in New Jersey called Angela Redding found out that her child's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=0.0s)]
*  elementary school was advertising something called pansexuality, and she thought this [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  seems a little much for an elementary school, so she complained about it on Facebook. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=12.8s)]
*  What happened next didn't used to happen in this country and never should, and we only [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=16.76s)]
*  know about it because of a sub-stack called Chaos and Control, which broke the story. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  And as we read it, we thought, this can't be real, but it is. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=23.48s)]
*  So in response to Angela Redding's post, out of the blue, an army officer at Joint Base [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=26.2s)]
*  MDL, it's a nearby military base, called Angela Redding an extremist on Facebook. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=31.78s)]
*  That officer is called Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Schilling. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Schilling then wrote on Facebook that, quote, the Joint Base leadership have had the security [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=40.44s)]
*  forces working with multiple state and local law enforcement agencies to monitor the situation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=45.78s)]
*  What? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=53.08s)]
*  So the military responded to a mom in an elementary school complaining about the sexualization [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=54.84s)]
*  of her own child? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  That's a warranted a military response under Joe Biden? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=61.88s)]
*  Apparently it did. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=64.48s)]
*  Then shortly after, the chief of the North Hanover Police Department, Robert Duff, pressured [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=65.48s)]
*  Redding to delete her Facebook post. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  Let that sink in. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=74.0s)]
*  The police and the military got involved because a mom wrote something on Facebook they didn't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=75.0s)]
*  like. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Today, Joint Base MDL confirmed to this show that they, quote, notified law enforcement [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  about the social media exchange, which is common information sharing practice among [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=86.24s)]
*  law enforcement agencies. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  Except, wait a second, a military base is not a, quote, law enforcement agency. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  The purpose of the military is to defend us from foreign enemies, not to police our Facebook [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=97.96s)]
*  posts. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=101.96s)]
*  This is mind boggling, and we pray someone does something about it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  Angela Redding is the mother who wrote that Facebook post at the military shutdown. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=107.72s)]
*  Angela, thank you so much for being brave enough to come on. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=111.82s)]
*  Were you a little surprised that the U.S. military weighed in on your Facebook post? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=114.98s)]
*  I was more than surprised. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=118.98s)]
*  I was scared. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  I actually pulled my kids from school the day I found out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  It was mind boggling, and I was worried for them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  When the U.S. military comes after you for simply raising concern about a public poster [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=126.86s)]
*  that is widely available for all to see, it's just, it's mind boggling, as you said. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=133.06s)]
*  And just to be clear, you weren't threatening war. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=138.5s)]
*  You didn't threaten to use nuclear weapons against the school, correct? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=140.7s)]
*  No, actually. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=144.06s)]
*  My post was really moderate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=145.44s)]
*  It essentially said that I didn't think my seven-year-old was age appropriate to be exposed [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=146.82s)]
*  to words such as polysexual and pansexual. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=152.96s)]
*  I said that all people are deserving of love and respect. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=156.14s)]
*  That my post was very explicit about that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=160.18s)]
*  And still it prompted this response, and it is really scary. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=162.82s)]
*  In this country, we can't have a right to speak and raise concerns about our public [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=168.16s)]
*  education system. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=173.64s)]
*  You live in an area with a lot of military families. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=175.56s)]
*  I know I think your children's school has a lot of military families in it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you, and I doubtless you respect the military, because almost all Americans do. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=180.44s)]
*  Did you know that they're reading your Facebook posts? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  I did not, and I actually want to be really explicit. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=187.72s)]
*  I believe that our military personnel deserves the utmost love, admiration, and respect. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=189.92s)]
*  I'm a daughter of a veteran. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  I live in a community with the military, and these are phenomenal families. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  Our school district is phenomenal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=201.44s)]
*  The teachers in our school district are phenomenal. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  I think this is a rogue actor, a bad faith actor, and I don't think that we need to implicate [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=205.8s)]
*  the entire population. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=210.6s)]
*  But I did not think that the military was monitoring mom's Facebook posts. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=213.16s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=219.56s)]
*  No, and you would hope that Lieutenant Colonel Schilling would be removed from his command [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=220.76s)]
*  tonight, and we'll be seeing if he is. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=225.44s)]
*  What was the role of the police chief? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=229.44s)]
*  Can you just tell us that quickly? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=230.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I actually got a call from the admin of the Facebook group. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=232.0s)]
*  Again, this is kind of ridiculous. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  We're talking about this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  This was a, it's a parents group that I posted on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  I got a call from the admin of the Facebook group saying that the police chief contacted [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  her to say that my post should come down. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=247.12s)]
*  And she said, what do you think? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  I said, well, I don't want Homeland Security coming after me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=251.96s)]
*  Take the post down. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  Like, I don't want to be dealing with this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=256.48s)]
*  So I agreed that the post could come down. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=258.12s)]
*  I then contacted the police chief directly and reminded him of the First Amendment and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=260.68s)]
*  that we shouldn't be utilizing government resources and our positions to pressure individuals [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=265.64s)]
*  to take down Facebook posts. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=271.38s)]
*  And I also, you know, shared with him the post that he had already seen. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=273.52s)]
*  There was nothing wrong. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=277.18s)]
*  It didn't violate any law. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=278.18s)]
*  It didn't violate any Facebook rule whatsoever. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=279.18s)]
*  So that's how that all happened. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  And you know, we're here today. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=285.7s)]
*  I hope Chief Huff is relieved of his post immediately too, because that's just, that's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=288.04s)]
*  I've never heard anything like this and I hope I never hear it again. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=292.7s)]
*  But I appreciate your telling us about it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=294.74s)]
*  Angela Redding, thank you so much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IsA_FpR4ZM&t=296.3s)]
