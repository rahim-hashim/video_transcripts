# Tucker: This is a major conflict of interest
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU)
*  Alvaro Abidoya, a name you probably haven't heard, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=0.0s)]
*  is the guy who's been nominated by Biden [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=3.04s)]
*  to serve on the Federal Trade Commission. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=4.72s)]
*  Now we don't talk about the FTC a lot. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=6.32s)]
*  There are a lot of federal agencies out there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=8.52s)]
*  This is a pretty important one. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=9.96s)]
*  The FTC is the responsibility of preventing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  or breaking up monopolies and protecting consumers' privacy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=13.96s)]
*  Now because of those duties, of course, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=17.96s)]
*  it has investigated Google in recent years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=19.92s)]
*  Both of those are problems Google causes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=22.0s)]
*  And so far, we believe it's been far too lenient. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=24.88s)]
*  So we're a little shocked to find out [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=27.84s)]
*  that a former Google lobbyist and current Google consultant [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=29.4s)]
*  is helping Shepard Abidoya through the confirmation process [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=32.44s)]
*  in the Senate to get to the FTC. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=36.48s)]
*  Well, that doesn't seem non-corrupt. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=39.16s)]
*  It seems actually the definition of corruption. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=40.96s)]
*  Robert Rabin is the man's name. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=43.2s)]
*  He's a prominent Democratic lobbyist in Washington. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=45.2s)]
*  His firm, called the Rabin Group, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=47.32s)]
*  represents dozens of clients. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=48.92s)]
*  Rabin himself was a registered lobbyist for Google [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  as recently as two years ago. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=53.12s)]
*  His firm still consults for Google, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=54.92s)]
*  the world's most powerful company. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=57.0s)]
*  This show has been told by multiple sources [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=58.84s)]
*  that Rabin is acting as a, quote, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=60.88s)]
*  Sherpa for Abidoya and arranging meetings between Abidoya [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=62.36000000000001s)]
*  and various Senate offices. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  Again, if that's true, that's corruption. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=67.76s)]
*  We reached out to Rabin, who confirmed that his firm [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=70.88000000000001s)]
*  is assisting Abidoya. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=73.4s)]
*  Obviously, a massive conflict of interest here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=75.72s)]
*  The guy who works for Google helping to install the guy [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  who regulates Google. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=83.64s)]
*  Now you've heard a few Democrats talk a big game [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=85.72s)]
*  about breaking up big tech [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=88.16s)]
*  and giving the power back to the public. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=89.4s)]
*  They don't mean it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=90.88s)]
*  How do you know that? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=92.52s)]
*  If Abidoya gets confirmed as an FTC commissioner, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=93.88s)]
*  do you think he's gonna forget who helped him get the job? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=97.0s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=100.36s)]
*  And Google is the company that did the Google [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=101.4s)]
*  that he's supposed to be regulating. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hdxjrBlyFU&t=103.84s)]
