# How a Latina Republican's victory in Texas primary flipped the media narrative
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA)
*  Well, for years and years and years, we've been told that wanting a border is racist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=0.0s)]
*  Only white supremacists want borders. Everyone else is an internationalist. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=4.64s)]
*  Well, it turns out that's not true. It never was true. But the results are in it's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=10.24s)]
*  completely untrue. Do you know who wants a border? Hispanic voters. In 2020, Donald Trump [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=14.64s)]
*  flipped Zapata County in Texas. That's 95% Hispanic. And last night, if you need more [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=21.36s)]
*  evidence in a special election, a Republican called Myra Flores flipped a district in South [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=25.68s)]
*  Texas that's 85% Hispanic. No Republican has represented that district since 1870. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=29.44s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself, why are so many self-described Latino voters [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=36.24s)]
*  voting for white nationalists? It's very odd. Glenn Greenwald has noticed this trend. He's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=42.72s)]
*  an independent journalist. His work is on Substack. We're happy to have him join us tonight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=46.96s)]
*  Hey, Glenn. So how does this work exactly? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=49.84s)]
*  It is kind of odd that the media narrative holds that the Republican Party is devoted to a project [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=52.48s)]
*  of white nationalism and white supremacy. And yet at the same time, large numbers of Latino, Asian, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=61.76s)]
*  Muslim, and black voters are either slowly or rapidly migrating to the Republican Party, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=68.64s)]
*  which you would think would make people question whether that narrative could possibly be true. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=74.8s)]
*  But you would be wrong. They're not questioning it. They're essentially attacking those people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=79.92s)]
*  by saying they're too dumb and too primitive to understand their self-interest. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=84.72s)]
*  The Democratic Party, and I just know this from personal experience traveling a lot, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=89.36s)]
*  does seem like a party that's wholly dominated by and that caters exclusively to the instincts of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=93.2s)]
*  45-year-old affluent, personally unhappy white women. That's just the way it seems to me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=99.92s)]
*  So how is that the Multiracial Party exactly? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=106.8s)]
*  The split between the reality and what elite media and journalists and political people have [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=111.92s)]
*  been saying could not be wider. Under the Trump presidency, Trump was held up as this Hitler-like [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=120.16s)]
*  figure, one of the two or three most racist people who wanted to genocide all non-white people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=125.2s)]
*  He attracted more black and more Latino and more Asian voters than any Republican in decades, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=130.72s)]
*  and Joe Biden won for one reason and one reason only because affluent suburban white women voted [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=138.0s)]
*  Democrat after voting for Republicans for a long time. It's the exact opposite of what the media [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=145.12s)]
*  has been claiming. And it's provable because we have the election result. It's just too unbelievable. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=150.88s)]
*  Glenn, great to see you. We will see you soon. Appreciate it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=157.2s)]
*  Yep. Good to talk to you, Tucker. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USeTC2CO3dA&t=160.88s)]
