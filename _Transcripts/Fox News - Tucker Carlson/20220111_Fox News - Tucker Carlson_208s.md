# Brit Hume: How did Biden get himself in this predicament?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk)
*  Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=0.0s)]
*  And no, it's not a chronological thing, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=2.84s)]
*  as he often says, it's a measure of wisdom. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=4.4s)]
*  So we're happy to have him join us tonight with his reaction. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=6.04s)]
*  Brit, this is the Democratic Party's top legislative goal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=8.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't think anything is even close. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=12.32s)]
*  Why are they so focused on this so-called voting rights? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=14.6s)]
*  Well, I think, first of all, it pleases the base. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=17.52s)]
*  And Biden has been kind of a slave [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=19.6s)]
*  to the left-wing base of his party since he became president. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  And it's also something that, if enacted, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  would enshrine in law the much-loosened voter regulations [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=28.4s)]
*  that prevailed during the pandemic collection year of 2020. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=34.0s)]
*  And it would make it easier for people to vote, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  easier for people who don't particularly want to vote to vote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  or easier to get them to vote. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=42.2s)]
*  It would also interfere with ballot security measures, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=43.96s)]
*  such as voter ID and other such measures, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=47.44s)]
*  which are widely supported by the American public. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  So this, I think, you know, you look at it piece by piece, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=53.32s)]
*  it's not really a set of very popular measures, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=55.92s)]
*  but it plays well with the base. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=58.6s)]
*  Biden wants to do it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=59.92s)]
*  He wants to, you know, he's... [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=60.92s)]
*  Tucker, I think to see this, we need to drill down a little bit. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=63.32s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=66.36s)]
*  How did Joe Biden get himself into this predicament? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=67.56s)]
*  Yes, I think that all the time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=70.0s)]
*  He was pretty moderate, I always thought. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=71.4s)]
*  After Election Day in 2020, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=73.48s)]
*  he was on his way to being president of the United States [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=75.28s)]
*  with the House only narrowly in his party's control [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=77.92s)]
*  and the Senate in Republican control. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=81.36s)]
*  There were two races in Georgia [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=83.6s)]
*  that were the Republicans to lose. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  And thanks to considerable extent to his administrations, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  the Republicans did lose them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  And suddenly the Democrats had, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  by the narrowest of possible margins, control of the Senate. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  And that's what got visions of historic sugar plums [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  dancing in Joe Biden's head. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=100.88s)]
*  And so this guy that was on his way [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=102.83999999999999s)]
*  to having to deal with the Republican Senate [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=104.52s)]
*  and the kind of moderate, you know, center-left politics [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=106.28s)]
*  that he'd practiced for most of his career [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=109.16s)]
*  went out the window in favor of this agenda [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=111.16s)]
*  that he's been embarked on ever since. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=113.72s)]
*  It hasn't worked well. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=115.44s)]
*  He's now widely unpopular. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  His party is unpopular. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=118.32s)]
*  They're looking like they're gonna have a staggering losses, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=119.56s)]
*  potentially staggering losses in the midterms. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=121.6s)]
*  And he's out doing this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=123.64s)]
*  He doesn't seem to know how to sort of change course. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=125.56s)]
*  It may be too late for him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=128.48s)]
*  So I think it's such a smart observation. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=129.88s)]
*  It was getting that much power [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=132.76s)]
*  or the appearance of that much power that wrecked him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=135.28s)]
*  That little power that he thought was, you know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=137.76s)]
*  could be converted into some kind of historic sweet. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=139.72s)]
*  I think he's always felt that, you know, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=142.64s)]
*  he was under the shadow of the great Barack Obama. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=144.84s)]
*  And, you know, I think there's reason to believe [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  Barack Obama didn't take him seriously. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  Obama's famously quoted as saying, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=152.2s)]
*  you should never underestimate the ability of Joe [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=154.68s)]
*  to eff things up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=157.16s)]
*  Well, Afghanistan, and you go down the list, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=158.72s)]
*  things are pretty effed up [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  in this particular administration. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=163.48s)]
*  And, you know, he's got inflation running out of control [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=166.72s)]
*  and so on, and he seems at sea. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=169.12s)]
*  And what he continues to do [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=171.56s)]
*  is to try to press forward with this agenda. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=173.32s)]
*  And most of his parties seem willing to go along with it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=175.68s)]
*  Although there are a few holdouts, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=179.04s)]
*  and in this tightly divided Congress, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=180.52s)]
*  it only takes a few to block his agenda. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=182.6s)]
*  Fascinating. Really smart. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=184.68s)]
*  Richie, thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=186.44s)]
*  You bet. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=187.28s)]
*  Well, Tony Fauci testified on Capitol Hill today, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=190.04s)]
*  and he would not answer the most basic questions posed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRzmNxvAysk&t=192.64000000000001s)]
