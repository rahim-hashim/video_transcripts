# Ron DeSantis: We've proven this establishment talking point wrong
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ)
*  There's probably no county in America more symbolically important to the Democratic Party [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  than Miami-Dade in Florida, South Florida. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=5.34s)]
*  New polling there indicates that Ron DeSantis, who's running for re-election as governor [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  of the state of Florida, may win Miami-Dade, which is pretty unbelievable. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=14.08s)]
*  So why? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=19.2s)]
*  How did Ron DeSantis, who served for one term as governor of Florida, apparently shift Miami-Dade [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Republican? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=28.16s)]
*  What's going on here exactly? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=29.16s)]
*  Not all disinformation, we suspect. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=31.16s)]
*  Ron DeSantis joins us tonight. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=32.4s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=35.28s)]
*  Hey, how are you? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=40.04s)]
*  Great for coming on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  So these are just polls, but it does seem possible that you will win Miami-Dade, which [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=42.84s)]
*  wouldn't have seemed possible two years ago. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=49.92s)]
*  So what exactly is going on here? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=53.44s)]
*  To what do you attribute? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=55.64s)]
*  There's clearly been a shift. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=56.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  I think there's a number of factors. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=60.08s)]
*  I mean, one, I was the governor that was saving their jobs, their businesses, and keeping [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  their kids in school during COVID. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=67.28s)]
*  The Democratic Party opposed me on every single one of those policies, and they wanted basically [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  indefinite lockdowns and school closures. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=75.52s)]
*  And that is not good for blue collar people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=78.4s)]
*  We also have done very strong on crime. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  When you had the Floyd riots, I immediately called out the National Guard. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=84.4s)]
*  We were not going to let that happen in Florida. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=88.52s)]
*  We are a law and order state, and they know I'm a law and order governor. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=90.52s)]
*  I think that's important. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=93.63999999999999s)]
*  And then I also think we reflect their values as parents raising kids. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  We fought Disney to make sure that the kids wouldn't be sexualized in elementary school [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=99.52s)]
*  by keeping things like gender ideology out of the classroom. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  But yet it's the left that wants to put all that in there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  So I think you just see Latinos down here, but really blue collar people generally saying [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  we're representing them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=116.76s)]
*  We are standing up for them, their jobs, their education, their safety, and their families. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  So I once saw Frank Luntz, who's a famous Republican pollster, tell Republican members [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=124.68s)]
*  of Congress that they wanted to win Hispanic votes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=129.56s)]
*  They had to move left. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=131.84s)]
*  You're saying you've won those votes by moving right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=133.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=136.96s)]
*  And including on immigration. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=138.96s)]
*  My first year, we banned sanctuary cities and news media thought that that would be [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=141.4s)]
*  not approved down here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=146.0s)]
*  And yet Hispanic voters in Florida had the highest approval rating for our policy to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  ban sanctuary cities. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  We did the transport to Martha's Vineyard and people thought that this was going to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  be so bad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=159.12s)]
*  And yet Hispanic voters backed me on doing that because they understand the border is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=160.12s)]
*  out of control. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  So I think it's on all of these issues. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  But clearly the Republican establishment view that you need open borders and amnesty to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=167.68s)]
*  appeal to Hispanic voters in the United States is dead wrong. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=173.56s)]
*  It was wrong then and it's clearly been proven to be wrong now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=177.72s)]
*  They've been saying it for 30 years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=181.36s)]
*  It's just an amazing experiment in democracy, actually. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida on the eve of the election. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=186.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=188.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwWJhvtUWQ&t=190.4s)]
