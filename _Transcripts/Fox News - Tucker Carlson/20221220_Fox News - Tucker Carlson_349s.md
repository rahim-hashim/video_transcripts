# Tucker Carlson: This is a lie
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=0.0s)]
*  This past summer, which is just a few months to go before the midterm elections, the Biden [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=3.92s)]
*  administration faced a huge problem called the economy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=7.84s)]
*  Most voters vote on the basis of the economy and how they feel they're doing and how they [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=11.72s)]
*  feel their country's doing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=16.36s)]
*  And their country at the time was not doing well. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=17.86s)]
*  The U.S. economy had just recorded two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=19.44s)]
*  That's not just an academic observation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=24.46s)]
*  That's a technical definition of a recession. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=27.5s)]
*  Two quarters declining GDP. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=31.58s)]
*  Recession. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=34.38s)]
*  We're not making that up. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=35.38s)]
*  You'll find it in every economics textbook ever written. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=36.58s)]
*  Go look up the one you used in college. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=39.38s)]
*  But the Biden administration could not admit that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=43.32s)]
*  If they admitted the U.S. was in a recession, they would lose the Senate. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=45.46s)]
*  They would lose control of both chambers of the Congress. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  So they had to lie about it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=52.44s)]
*  But how do you lie about something that's so easily defined? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=54.0s)]
*  You can see. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=56.78s)]
*  Well, you just changed the definition. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=57.78s)]
*  And that's what they did. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=60.14s)]
*  They came up with a new definition of recession. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=61.14s)]
*  So don't look at GDP. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=63.74s)]
*  That's the old way, the racist way of assessing the economy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=65.16s)]
*  Look at holistic factors, said the White House. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=69.06s)]
*  Look at the labor market, for example. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=71.38s)]
*  The labor market. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=73.38s)]
*  Well, then in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics gave them ammunition for their case. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=74.38s)]
*  The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a report that showed the labor market was strong. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=82.56s)]
*  They determined that the U.S. economy had added more than a million jobs in the second [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=87.22s)]
*  quarter of this year from March to June. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=91.48s)]
*  A million jobs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=95.08s)]
*  It's a big story. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=96.08s)]
*  And of course, Joe Biden wasted no time in touting it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=97.08s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=100.48s)]
*  Our job market remains historically strong. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  Our economy created more than nine million jobs since I came to office, in no small part [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=104.98s)]
*  because the people on this stage. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=110.0s)]
*  Our economy created more than one million jobs in the second quarter. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=112.2s)]
*  A million new jobs in the second quarter despite negative growth. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=118.2s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=123.0s)]
*  How do you get a million new jobs with negative growth? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=124.84s)]
*  That seems like magic. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=127.2s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  But no one in the media asked questions. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=130.88s)]
*  Instead, they repeated the White House line, which was the BLS report, the Bureau of Labor [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=132.4s)]
*  showing a million new jobs proves we can't be in a recession. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=138.66s)]
*  They all said it, quote, the jobs report suggests the Biden economy is not in a recession, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=142.5s)]
*  wrote the New York Times. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=148.9s)]
*  And then of course, there were other stories like that, too. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=149.9s)]
*  So on the basis of that and other factors, they won. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=153.1s)]
*  They now have control of the Senate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=158.32s)]
*  And now we get to learn the truth. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=160.3s)]
*  A million new jobs, really? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=162.62s)]
*  The Philadelphia Fed decided to check those numbers and they found the U.S. economy did [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=164.42s)]
*  not add more than a million jobs in the second quarter this year. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=168.42s)]
*  Instead, the net additional jobs was about 10,000. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=172.1s)]
*  So that's less than 1% of the job growth the administration claimed. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=177.22s)]
*  That's not a rounding error. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=180.33999999999997s)]
*  That's not a minor math mistake. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  This is a country that supposedly sent a man to the moon. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  We can do math, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=186.77999999999997s)]
*  This isn't like thinking about 100 bucks in your pocket and finding out you had 85. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=189.38s)]
*  This is like claiming you had a million dollars in your pocket and finding out you had 10,000. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=193.38s)]
*  This is like claiming you were rich when you were actually bankrupt. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=197.94s)]
*  This is a lie. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=200.5s)]
*  So how did they get it wrong by more than a million jobs? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  How did they construct this lie? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=204.98s)]
*  Well, as of tonight, we're not really sure. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=206.14s)]
*  We now know that BLS numbers didn't just help Joe Biden, though. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  There was another purpose. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=211.94s)]
*  These fake numbers also gave the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, a justification [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  to continue raising interest rates. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=219.32s)]
*  On the basis of that report, they can raise rates. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=222.1s)]
*  Here was Powell just a few days ago. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=224.9s)]
*  Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=227.58s)]
*  We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=232.78s)]
*  of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=238.06s)]
*  Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=243.94s)]
*  rate near a 50-year low. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  Job vacancies still very high and wage growth elevated. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=250.74s)]
*  Job gains have been robust. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=255.58s)]
*  Ooh, every word of that a lie. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=257.82s)]
*  The justification is a lie. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=261.38s)]
*  And in fact, as Powell well knows, there are 7 million American men of working age who [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=262.98s)]
*  are not working. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  They're watching the internet all day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=270.86s)]
*  So why are they lying to us about this? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, the effects are very obvious. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  Go try and take out a car loan or a home loan or any kind of loan. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=276.7s)]
*  Or if you have a loan, it's got an adjustable rate, watch how much more you're paying per month. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=280.3s)]
*  So why are they doing this? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=285.38s)]
*  Well, the administration wants Powell to raise rates because they think it'll offset the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=286.38s)]
*  inflation that Joe Biden's policies have caused. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=289.62s)]
*  But this is a huge problem for everyone else. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=292.82s)]
*  Raising rates when the economy is faltering and people don't have jobs, if you keep doing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  that, you could cause an actual collapse. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=301.5s)]
*  That seems like the course they put us on. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=305.7s)]
*  The Biden administration got the interest rate hike it wanted even when the labor market [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=307.94s)]
*  has been flatlining. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=311.86s)]
*  William Beach runs the Bureau of Labor Statistics. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=313.34s)]
*  Marty Walsh runs the Department of Labor. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=315.38s)]
*  They need to explain why anyone should ever trust the most basic economic numbers, government [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  issues ever again. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=322.7s)]
*  And it's one thing to get the numbers wrong, but then to base future policies on numbers [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=326.06s)]
*  you know are wrong. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=329.62s)]
*  What is that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=330.78s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=331.78s)]
*  Jerome Powell should probably answer that question fairly soon. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=333.42s)]
*  He won't join us tonight either. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwmvCR5I6HA&t=336.66s)]
