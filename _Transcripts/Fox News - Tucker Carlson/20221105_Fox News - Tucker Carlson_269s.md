# Tucker: Where was Kathy Hochul?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA)
*  If you're the Democratic Party of New York, you are calling every union leader and hack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=0.0s)]
*  in the state and just shoveling cash to people to keep Lee Zeldin from winning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=4.12s)]
*  Zeldin is the Republican congressman for Suffolk County. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=8.48s)]
*  Looks like he could be the next governor of New York, a state that went for Biden by 23 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=10.6s)]
*  points. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  So what's that about? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=16.12s)]
*  Well, simple, violent crime. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=17.12s)]
*  It's out of control, particularly in New York City. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=19.28s)]
*  It's destroying the city. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=21.36s)]
*  For example, around 5.30 a.m. this morning in New York, a homeless man with 25 prior [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=22.68s)]
*  arrests, a suspect in previous sexual assaults who was out on the street. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=28.6s)]
*  That man raped and robbed a 43-year-old woman who was out jogging in the West Village, a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=33.84s)]
*  very nice, probably the nicest part of the city. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=38.6s)]
*  Again, this guy was already wanted for two prior sex crimes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=41.24s)]
*  In one of them, back in April, he sexually assaulted a different woman who was out for [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=45.24s)]
*  a jog. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=48.52s)]
*  In October, he tried to rip the clothes off a 48-year-old woman walking on FDR Drive. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=49.52s)]
*  Then he tried to rape her. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  So why was this guy walking around the city this morning? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=55.94s)]
*  And the real question is, since this guy just raped someone in the West Village this morning, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=59.58s)]
*  where was Kathy Hochul, the great defender of women? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=63.9s)]
*  Oh, she's a woman. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=66.94s)]
*  She's a big feminist. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=67.94s)]
*  Did Kathy Hochul say anything about this today? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=69.58s)]
*  Anything? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=71.97999999999999s)]
*  It's one of the biggest issues going in the midterms. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=72.97999999999999s)]
*  No, she said nothing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=75.06s)]
*  She talked about gun control, which New York has had for 60 years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=76.06s)]
*  It has stricter gun control than almost any state. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=79.5s)]
*  It has nothing to do with gun control. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=81.7s)]
*  This is rape. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=82.78s)]
*  And it's gone way up in New York under Kathy Hochul. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  She should be ashamed and she should lose. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=87.82000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people feel that way. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=89.5s)]
*  A new Pew survey of registered voters showed that 82% of black Democrats believe violent [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=90.98s)]
*  crime is a quote, very important issue. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=95.56s)]
*  You know who doesn't care about violent crime? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  People don't have to deal with it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  Only 33% of white liberals care. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  Huh. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  What explains the difference there? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=106.62s)]
*  Larry Elder is a former candidate for governor of California. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=107.7s)]
*  He's also the host of the Larry Elder Show. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  On the Epic Times, he joins us tonight. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=112.10000000000001s)]
*  Larry, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=113.78s)]
*  So you'd think like if you are a feminist candidate and empower women and girl power [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=115.7s)]
*  and all that stuff and you're Kathy Hochul and people are getting raped in huge numbers [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=120.18s)]
*  in your state, you would say something about it, maybe? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=124.42s)]
*  Well, you'd think so. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=128.06s)]
*  And that poll pretty is very telling. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=130.78s)]
*  82% of white, 82% of black Democrats believe crime is a very serious problem. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  Only 33% of white Democrats feel that way. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=139.22s)]
*  Again, as you pointed out, that's because they don't have to face the consequences. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=141.78s)]
*  But this is not all that surprising. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=145.46s)]
*  There's a website called Policemag.com. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=147.9s)]
*  And those who were self-described, Tucker, as very liberal were asked how many unarmed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=151.58s)]
*  black men did the police kill in 2019? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=156.82000000000002s)]
*  Half of them thought the police killed 1,000 unarmed black men. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=160.02s)]
*  And 5% of them thought the police killed 10,000 unarmed black men. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  Now, the answer, according to the Washington Post database, was 12. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=167.02s)]
*  So they're not concerned about crime, but they're very, very concerned about the alleged [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=170.62s)]
*  systemic racism against the police, which is why you have all these DAs all around the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=174.74s)]
*  country, many of them backed by George Soros money, soft on crime, cashless bail, letting [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=178.58s)]
*  bad guys out on the streets because they believe that they are victims of society as opposed [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=183.82s)]
*  to people who are victimizing other people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=187.74s)]
*  Most of them are black and brown people living in the inner city. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=189.9s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=192.74s)]
*  And I'm just wondering, I mean, the Republicans like Lee Zeldin who are running on this message [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  are doing really well. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  Why isn't every Republican, this is a civilizational issue, why isn't every Republican running [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=199.9s)]
*  on it? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=203.74s)]
*  Well, all the ones that I've talked to, and I've been around the country on behalf of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=204.74s)]
*  people like Carrie Lake and people like a woman named Caroline Leavitt who's running [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=209.02s)]
*  in New Hampshire, and crime is a big issue all around the country, and it should be. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=213.9s)]
*  But, Tucker, I want to talk a little bit more about this white liberal thing because white [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=218.06s)]
*  liberals are often a clear and present danger to black people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=221.3s)]
*  It was white liberals who pushed the welfare state that has incentivized women to marry [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=224.24s)]
*  the government and men to abandon their financial and moral responsibility to the point now [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=227.7s)]
*  where you have 70 percent of black boys and girls entering the world without a father [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=231.14s)]
*  married to the mother. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=236.72s)]
*  It was white liberals that pressured banks into lowering lending standards. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=237.72s)]
*  So when we had the recession, a whole bunch of people got wiped out. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=240.78s)]
*  Black net worth fell dramatically. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=243.98s)]
*  These are all white liberals. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=245.74s)]
*  Let me just make a quick point. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=247.06s)]
*  One of my friends is the economist Walter Williams. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=249.82s)]
*  He wrote a column once where he issued a proclamation forgiving white people of all the bad things [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=252.06s)]
*  they've done in the past so that white liberals can stop acting like fools, he said, because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=257.24s)]
*  you're hurting us. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=261.08s)]
*  Malcolm X was right about them, for sure. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=263.4s)]
*  Larry Elder, great to see you tonight. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DIM53OFZA&t=268.0s)]
