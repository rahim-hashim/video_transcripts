# African reporter reveals why Karine Jean-Pierre wonâ€™t meet with him till 2024
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y)
*  So the White House press secretary doesn't, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  despite the title, exist to convey information [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=1.62s)]
*  but to withhold it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=4.34s)]
*  And in this White House, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=6.26s)]
*  the press secretary bans any reporter [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=7.54s)]
*  who asks real questions. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=9.5s)]
*  And that includes, and it especially includes, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=10.68s)]
*  a man called Simon Atiba. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=13.22s)]
*  Simon Atiba is the most famous, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=14.9s)]
*  and we would say finest, reporter in all Africa. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=17.14s)]
*  And that means that Karine Jean-Pierre [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=20.26s)]
*  does not want to talk to him at all. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=21.82s)]
*  She hasn't called on him in more than four months. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=23.1s)]
*  Now the White House says that Karine Jean-Pierre [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=25.54s)]
*  will not meet with Simon Atiba until next year, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=28.16s)]
*  which of course means never. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=31.16s)]
*  Simon Atiba is with Today News Africa. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=33.28s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=35.36s)]
*  Simon, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=36.28s)]
*  So on what grounds will she just not meet with you? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=38.42s)]
*  First of all, thank you for having me, Taka. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=44.56s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=46.56s)]
*  On your show. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  It's the most watched show, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=48.22s)]
*  and I'm always glad to be here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=49.14s)]
*  You know, has the voice of Africa in the U.S. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=51.6s)]
*  I love the U.S. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  I always love freedom. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  I love democracy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=58.74s)]
*  And even if you paid me $100 million to move to China, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=59.58s)]
*  I will not move to China. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=63.34s)]
*  I would like to be in the U.S. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=64.54s)]
*  Because the ideals of the U.S. is the ideals, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=66.34s)]
*  you know, those are the things that I love, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=70.06s)]
*  and those are the things that most Africans also love. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=72.54s)]
*  I feel like Karine Jean-Pierre, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=75.26s)]
*  she has no clue what is happening in Africa. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=76.62s)]
*  She doesn't understand that China is expanding [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=79.36s)]
*  and also spreading disinformation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=82.34s)]
*  and misinformation against the U.S., [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=84.58s)]
*  that they are competing against the U.S. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=86.76s)]
*  Competition is good, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  but then when competition comes with destroying democracy, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=90.2s)]
*  and that becomes a problem. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=95.4s)]
*  And she doesn't know that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  That's why she discriminated against me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  She's not called on me for the past four months. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=100.12s)]
*  And so last week I tried to meet with her. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=103.12s)]
*  She told me she will not meet with me until 2024, maybe. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=105.48s)]
*  I wonder if it's the case that she doesn't call on you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  because she doesn't want to hear [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=114.14s)]
*  about Chinese influence in Africa. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=116.18s)]
*  Yes, I feel like she doesn't take serious questions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=119.9s)]
*  She wants to have questions that she's received in advance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=123.86s)]
*  She doesn't want, I ask tough questions. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=129.94s)]
*  I ask tough questions. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=133.1s)]
*  I may ask about, you know, many things that happen in Africa, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=134.26s)]
*  including immigration, for instance. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=138.46s)]
*  How does it make sense that Africans who are here, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=140.72s)]
*  for instance, who came legally, apply for asylum legally, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  have to wait for six years for their cases to even be heard, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=148.6s)]
*  and their cases are not heard after six months, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  but they see people crossing, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=157.12s)]
*  just walking across the border, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=158.56s)]
*  and then they have all the benefit the next day. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  How is that fair to Africans? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, that seems like a completely reasonable question, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=166.44s)]
*  and you have the authority to ask it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=170.12s)]
*  Simon and T, but we are rooting for you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  in the White House briefing room. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  We hope they'll change their minds [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=175.22s)]
*  and stop what they're doing, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=176.46s)]
*  but in the meantime, you always have a place here on the show. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=178.06s)]
*  Thank you. Good to see you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=179.94s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRjoWGIgF-Y&t=181.9s)]
