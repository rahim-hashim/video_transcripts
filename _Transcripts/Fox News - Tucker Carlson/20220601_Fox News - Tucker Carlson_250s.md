# Brett Favre says this mindset will position you for success
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80)
*  You just play and let the chips fall where they may. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=0.0s)]
*  And save your money, enjoy yourself. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=8.84s)]
*  But you don't try to, because when you start doing that, it's like, I'm going to play [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=12.68s)]
*  in this game, in this preseason game, but I'm going to play not to get hurt. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=18.76s)]
*  Well, who's the first person to get hurt? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=22.36s)]
*  That guy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=24.64s)]
*  And that's the way, not everybody, but the mentality some of the guys would have was [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=26.14s)]
*  I'm going to play this amount of time, or I'm going to play this way in this game. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=31.46s)]
*  And you can't play that way. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=36.46s)]
*  And you can't, your mindset, I don't think you can be successful because before you know [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  it, it's over. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  And you go, well, I thought I was going to play years, but I didn't even make the roster. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  And I saw that happen so many times. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=50.8s)]
*  It sounds like a broader life lesson. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  So you're just all in every day and then kind of let what happens happen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=55.339999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=59.86s)]
*  You know, and what was so cool about the game of football and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  the teammates was all different backgrounds, race, size, speed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=68.34s)]
*  There was just a discrepancy, but we came together as one. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=76.06s)]
*  And that was the beauty of it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=81.06s)]
*  When you won an unbelievable game that you won on the last play, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=83.05999999999999s)]
*  celebrate with your teammates, there's nothing like it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=87.97999999999999s)]
*  I can't describe to you what that feeling is to see the guys look at me like, man, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=91.1s)]
*  we did it, we did it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=97.97999999999999s)]
*  And the we is an important part of that phrase. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=100.06s)]
*  And like throwing a touchdown pass in Lambeau Field, there's no substitute for [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=103.74s)]
*  that we that united feeling that and losing a tough game together, man. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=109.02s)]
*  Crying. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=115.02s)]
*  I cried to many a days after a tough loss, but I cried with my teammates and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=115.82s)]
*  because it mattered and not every guy played that way or with that passion or [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=121.94s)]
*  I think when it was over for him, however many years it was, how [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=131.42s)]
*  much or how little they didn't appreciate it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=136.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=142.82000000000002s)]
*  And I coached high school football for two years when I retired. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=143.46s)]
*  Didn't make any money, didn't want any money and enjoyed the hell out of it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  And I thought I was, it was kind of a favor to the head coach to be his [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=153.22000000000003s)]
*  offense coordinator, but it ended up being a blessing because I really enjoyed it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=157.78s)]
*  But I would tell those kids all the time, you got to enjoy the moment. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=163.46s)]
*  I said, first of all, you're young. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=167.86s)]
*  When I was your age, I couldn't wait to be 21 or move on to the next level. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=169.46s)]
*  And while I was fortunate enough that I played long enough in NFL that time sort [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=174.9s)]
*  of stopped if that makes sense. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=179.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  Along the way where that I could kind of stop and smell the roses, you know, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=181.62s)]
*  the first seven, five, seven, eight years, man, it was balls to the wall, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=185.58s)]
*  just blowing and going. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  And next thing I know, it's like, it seemed like it took forever. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=191.42s)]
*  But before you knew it, it's like, you know, when you turn 30, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=194.38s)]
*  the next birthday is 50, you're 53. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=198.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  The next birthday was 53. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=200.82s)]
*  You're like, damn, where'd all the 23 years in between go? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=201.94s)]
*  Just in a, you know, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  So I was fortunate enough that I played long enough that I could kind of stop [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=205.98s)]
*  and say, you know, enjoy this, enjoy this moment, no matter how fun or, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=209.77999999999997s)]
*  or disappointing it is, enjoy this moment because there'll be a time when it, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  too quickly, it'll be gone. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=221.02s)]
*  And I saw so many guys not that it was here and gone, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  just like them, and never got to appreciate it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=228.58s)]
*  So tomorrow you can see part two of that conversation with Brett Favre. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=233.74s)]
*  It's going to be on Fox Nation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=236.94s)]
*  Part one is already online. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4pAEt-_80&t=238.22s)]
