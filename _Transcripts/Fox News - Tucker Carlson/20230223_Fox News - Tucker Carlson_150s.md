# Tucker Carlson: This is one of my favorite stories of all time
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0)
*  Here is a breath of hilarity, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=0.0s)]
*  really one of our favorite stories of all time. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=1.72s)]
*  Tanzanian fashion designer based in Houston [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=4.0s)]
*  called Asa Koshman says she lost her luggage [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=6.72s)]
*  to the baggage claim of DCA, Washington Reagan National [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=9.76s)]
*  back in 2018. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  A couple of days ago, she was watching Fox News [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=14.76s)]
*  and she saw the coverage of Sam Brinton. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=16.64s)]
*  That would be Joe Biden's non-binary nuclear waste [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  disposal expert who had this weird fetish [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=21.6s)]
*  involving stealing women's clothes from airport carousels. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  And then it hit Compson. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=28.48s)]
*  Sam Brinton was photographed wearing her clothes [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  and their very distinctive clothes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=34.76s)]
*  You're seeing the side-by-side on your screen right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=36.36s)]
*  Now we're in touch with her. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=39.34s)]
*  She's in Tanzania right now, but when she gets back, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=41.68s)]
*  she promises to come on this show [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=44.24s)]
*  and discuss what it's like to have your fashion creations [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=46.2s)]
*  stolen by Joe Biden's nuclear waste [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=49.84s)]
*  non-binary airport fetishist. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=54.24s)]
*  But in the meantime, we're joined by Chadwick [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=57.52s)]
*  Moore of The Spectator to assess this ongoing story, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=59.28s)]
*  which really is Chadwick, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  you gotta admit, the greatest story ever. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Now I just have to ask, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=66.04s)]
*  you've been following this since the beginning. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=67.12s)]
*  You first saw this guy, Sam Brinton, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=68.3s)]
*  was your first thought, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=70.16s)]
*  I bet this guy never steals women's underwear [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=71.0s)]
*  off airport carousels. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, you have to pardon my glee [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=75.72s)]
*  because I don't think anyone thought this story [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  could possibly get any better. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  And now, you know, two words that have to apply to him [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=83.2s)]
*  that I would mean sincerely in this case [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=86.36s)]
*  would be stunning and really, really brave. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=88.48s)]
*  It's not like he's parading around in a Gap hoodie. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=91.8s)]
*  I mean, they're very distinctive, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=95.2s)]
*  you know, quite lovely clothing that he was wearing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=96.84s)]
*  and that poor designer having her creations defiled [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=100.08s)]
*  by the radioactive klepto queen in the energy department. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=103.8s)]
*  I really feel for her, that must be awful. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=107.72s)]
*  But this, I'm a little disappointed in myself [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=109.84s)]
*  and in fellow journalists that none of us [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=113.36s)]
*  took a closer look at his clothing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=116.56s)]
*  and asked what exactly he was wearing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=118.12s)]
*  because we should have been tipped off [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=120.44s)]
*  the minute we saw some of these outfits [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=121.92s)]
*  that looked like he raided a village in Africa or something. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=123.36s)]
*  Maybe we would have started getting more answers then. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=126.24s)]
*  That was not off the rack [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=129.02s)]
*  and that should have been the first tip off [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=130.28s)]
*  that he had a Tanzanian designer he was stealing from. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=132.2s)]
*  And I agree with you, we fell down on the job. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=134.8s)]
*  Chad McMor, great to see you tonight, thank you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=137.12s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwXHA8WHd0&t=139.64s)]
