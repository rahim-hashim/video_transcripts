# GOP candidate Mike Lawler wins seat in deep-blue New York
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4)
*  And as we told you a minute ago, the other thing that happened that was kind of great and that we're enjoying is that the guy in charge of getting Democrats elected to Congress himself lost his name is Sean Patrick Maloney. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=0.0s)]
*  He represented the Hudson Valley. He was beaten by Mike Lawler's now the congressman elect and he joins us tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=9.0s)]
*  Congressman like thanks so much for coming on. How'd you do this? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=15.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me Tucker. Well, look, Democrats control everything in Washington, Albany and New York City for the first time in our nation's history. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=19.0s)]
*  And they have created an absolute mess, a 41 year record high on inflation, surging crime, skyrocketing energy costs and a poorest southern border with not only a massive inflow of illegal immigration, but drugs coming into our communities, killing 300 Americans a day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=28.0s)]
*  And voters in New York were fed up and they had enough. They wanted to restore balance and common sense to every level of government. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=46.0s)]
*  We've picked up four congressional seats in New York and we are going to have 11 of New York's 26 members as Republicans come January. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=54.0s)]
*  And that is historic. And I think in my district, especially, you know, Sean Patrick Maloney was as chair of the D triple C sent a memo to state Democrats back in January of this year demanding that they gerrymander New York's congressional maps and knock Republicans down to three seats. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=63.0s)]
*  Well, they did it. And then the courts intervened. A Democrat appointed Court of Appeals throughout the maps, called it gerrymandered and unconstitutional and appointed a special master. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=83.0s)]
*  And we got a fair map. And when I looked at the map, I knew I could win the seat. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=93.0s)]
*  Forty two percent of it is Rockland County, where I'm born and raised. I've lived my entire life. My family has been here over 100 years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=99.0s)]
*  We won Rockland by 10 points. And that's why I defeated Sean Patrick Maloney yesterday. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=106.0s)]
*  It's just we're savoring the irony of probably not enough victories to celebrate. But the ones that came through are worth celebrating. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=112.0s)]
*  And this one is especially amazing because this is the guy in charge of getting Democrats elected to Congress. Do you think he saw it coming? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=119.0s)]
*  No, not really, because he was gallivanting across the globe to Paris and Geneva and London just a month ago, raising money for Nancy Pelosi. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=126.0s)]
*  And it wasn't until about two weeks ago that he realized he had a problem when he had to call in Bill Clinton to come campaign. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=135.0s)]
*  He asked Hillary Clinton to send an email and not 30,000 that she deleted. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=143.0s)]
*  But he also asked Jill Biden to come in and do a fundraiser for just last week. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=149.0s)]
*  You know, this district, this district is home to the Clintons and George Soros. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=156.0s)]
*  And the fact that they now have a Republican congressman speaks volumes to where the electorate is. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=162.0s)]
*  It's pretty great. It really is. And we're going to celebrate. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=169.0s)]
*  Congressman like Mike Waller of Rockland County, New York. Thank you so much. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=172.0s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1FI7iojK4&t=178.0s)]
