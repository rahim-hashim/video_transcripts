# Tucker: What would be the justification for holding back knowledge of UFOs from the public?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds)
*  So here's what we know about UFOs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=0.0s)]
*  The US government has verified the real, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=2.48s)]
*  in the sense there are objects moving in the sky [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=4.84s)]
*  that we cannot identify. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=7.48s)]
*  They're certain they do not belong to a foreign nation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=9.5s)]
*  They're not from Russia or from China. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  And third, we know that these objects are moving in ways [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=13.8s)]
*  that we cannot replicate, explain, or even understand. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=17.16s)]
*  So everyone who studied this in the US government [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=20.72s)]
*  will admit that privately. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=22.8s)]
*  No one has really said that out loud, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=24.72s)]
*  and that may change very soon. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=26.26s)]
*  So for the first time in half a century, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=28.94s)]
*  there will be a public hearing on UFOs. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=30.78s)]
*  The House Intelligence Subcommittee will hear [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=32.94s)]
*  from two senior Pentagon officials tomorrow [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=34.36s)]
*  on what the Defense Department actually knows [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=37.82s)]
*  about these objects. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=39.58s)]
*  The Pentagon and intel agencies are reportedly feuding tonight [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=40.7s)]
*  on how much the public should know. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=43.82s)]
*  Lou Elzondo is a man who does know. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=46.02s)]
*  He's a former Pentagon official who ran this program, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=48.02s)]
*  looking into these objects. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=50.7s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=51.78s)]
*  Lou, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  So- [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=54.5s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=55.34s)]
*  What would possibly be the justification [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=56.3s)]
*  for holding back from the public what the US government, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=59.26s)]
*  which the public pays for, knows about these objects? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=62.62s)]
*  Well, in fact, it might not be so much what we know, Tucker, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=67.06s)]
*  but the fact that we don't know some things. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=70.97999999999999s)]
*  Clearly, from a national security perspective, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=74.3s)]
*  the last thing you want to do is ever broadcast, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  if you will, your intelligence gaps to your enemy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=80.22s)]
*  And in this particular case, you said it yourself, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=84.16s)]
*  there's a lot more we don't know than we do know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=86.44s)]
*  But you're right, this is a historic move. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=88.64s)]
*  Since 50 years ago, the last time we were faced with this, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=91.16s)]
*  you had the Air Force briefing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  the results of Project Blue Book. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Here we are half a century later, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=98.56s)]
*  and now we have senior DOD officials now, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=100.28s)]
*  not just the Air Force, coming up [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=103.4s)]
*  and providing information to Congress [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=105.6s)]
*  and ultimately the American people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=108.36s)]
*  Do you know if there have been conversations [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  between American officials and their counterparts [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=113.44s)]
*  in, say, Russia and China over these objects? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=115.6s)]
*  I mean, they're not just spotted [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=117.6s)]
*  around US military installations, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=118.8s)]
*  but also in those countries and around the world. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=120.8s)]
*  Do we ever talk about this offline? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=123.24s)]
*  Well, let me give you a real example. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=126.0s)]
*  There was a very classified memorandum at some point [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=127.56s)]
*  back in the 60s that the United States and Russia agreed [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=130.6s)]
*  in writing that we would report to each other [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=134.64s)]
*  when we were looking at the Northern Tier, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=138.2s)]
*  making sure that neither one of us thought the other [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=139.92s)]
*  was shooting a nuclear weapon at the other. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=142.2s)]
*  And there's actually a small paragraph that says, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  look, if you happen to see a UFO, do us a favor, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  call us first before you press the button, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  because it may very well be just that, a UFO, and not us. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=153.32s)]
*  And so I think there are certain examples of that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=158.92s)]
*  where we had information sharing with other countries, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=163.2s)]
*  in some cases, allied countries, and now even in the law, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=165.04s)]
*  the law that was just passed recently that was co, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=167.92s)]
*  if you will, sponsored by Senator Gillibrand [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=170.28s)]
*  and Senator Marco Rubio, where it says, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  now we are enjoying, we must, we have to work [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=174.44s)]
*  with our friends and allies on this topic. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  It's no longer an option, we have to do it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  So you've just, you've answered two questions. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=183.48s)]
*  One, the US government has had full awareness of this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=185.64s)]
*  for 60 years, this was in the 1960s, you said, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=189.56s)]
*  and second, we know for dead certain, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=192.48s)]
*  these are not foreign military aircraft. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=194.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, Congress is doing the right thing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=199.32s)]
*  by having these hearings, and I'll tell you something else, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  I suspect there's gonna be more hearings after this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=203.4s)]
*  This is just establishing the baseline for Congress. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=205.76s)]
*  But we know again about Project Blue Book, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=209.6s)]
*  we know about some efforts beforehand, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  and we know about my program, AATIP, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=214.12s)]
*  and then after that, we had the UAP task force. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=215.68s)]
*  But what about the 47 years in between? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=218.12s)]
*  What other efforts did the US government have? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  What did we learn in that time, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  and is there a way we can get that information [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  now under a single tent, so we're not in essence [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  reinventing the wheel, we can compare and contrast [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=231.4s)]
*  information we learned from before, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=233.56s)]
*  as compared to what we're learning now [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=235.32s)]
*  with better and more capable equipment. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=236.6s)]
*  This is an inherently significant story, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=240.16s)]
*  and maybe that's why it's been written off [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=242.08s)]
*  as the province of crazy people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=243.68s)]
*  You've persisted though, we appreciate it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=245.24s)]
*  Llew Elzando, thanks so much for that preview. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=246.36s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=248.52s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=250.4s)]
*  to catch our nightly opens, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=252.76s)]

*  and changing your life. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D4YsllIds&t=258.52000000000004s)]
