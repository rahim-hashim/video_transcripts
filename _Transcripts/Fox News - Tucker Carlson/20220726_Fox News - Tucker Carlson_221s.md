# 'Party of diversity' likes to live segregated lifestyles
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE)
*  Victor Davis Hansen has watched all of this happen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=0.0s)]
*  He is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=3.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=4.88s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=6.48s)]
*  So you see this massive disconnect. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=8.08s)]
*  You have this party that's openly [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=9.84s)]
*  and very aggressively anti-white, the Democratic Party. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=11.32s)]
*  And yet its leaders, including its leaders of color, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=13.76s)]
*  like the Obamas, live in all white neighborhoods. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=16.36s)]
*  How long can that continue, I wonder? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=18.52s)]
*  Oh, I don't think it's sustainable. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=22.6s)]
*  And what's new about the border, Tucker, it's not porous. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=24.04s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=27.44s)]
*  They blew it up. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=28.64s)]
*  There is no such thing as federal immigration law. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=29.56s)]
*  It's almost an insurrectionary, to use that term, act. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=32.32s)]
*  And you ask yourself, why are three million people [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=35.68s)]
*  going to come in the first two years of the Biden [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=39.08s)]
*  administration? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  And the answer is, it's the manifestation [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=42.6s)]
*  of this bi-coastal elite that's never [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  subject to the consequences of their own ideology. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=47.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=50.6s)]
*  They want vaccination. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=51.04s)]
*  Anybody that's not vaxxed in the military, out. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=52.08s)]
*  Anybody in the federal workforce, out. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Three million people come in untested, on vaxxed, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=56.8s)]
*  no problem whatsoever. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=59.6s)]
*  Walls are ossified. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=61.48s)]
*  They're calcified. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=62.6s)]
*  They don't work. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=63.36s)]
*  But my estate, I've got to have a big wall in Malibu [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  or Atherton, et cetera. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=67.28s)]
*  And then schools, we have to have a diverse school. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=68.96s)]
*  But my kids are going to be at a private academy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=71.44s)]
*  And I love diversity, but only as an employer [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=73.8s)]
*  that hires cheap labor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=76.24s)]
*  So this is new. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=77.6s)]
*  It really is. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=79.16s)]
*  It's nihilism. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=79.84s)]
*  And it really begs the question, why are they doing this? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=80.72s)]
*  It's a psychological projection so [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=85.12s)]
*  that they know they're guilty that they live [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=87.68s)]
*  apartheid-segregated existences. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=89.64s)]
*  And they don't want to change it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=92.36s)]
*  But they think by performance art, virtue signaling, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=93.68s)]
*  and the abstract, I'm for diversity. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=96.28s)]
*  I'm for open borders. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=98.56s)]
*  Then that squares the circle of their own privilege. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=99.48s)]
*  And I think everybody's onto them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  There's only one, I think, optimistic chance. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=103.76s)]
*  And the Hispanic vote, and especially [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=106.2s)]
*  the Mexican-American vote, who is the community most impacted [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=109.56s)]
*  by flooded social services and schools that can't handle [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=113.24s)]
*  this influx and increases in crime, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  if they vote 50-50 for Republican or conservative [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=120.32s)]
*  candidates in the fall, believe me, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  you will hear the 1992, 1996 Democratic convention rhetoric [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, the Clintons, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=132.88s)]
*  on how we have to have legal-only immigration. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=135.64s)]
*  Because they will not want to import people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=138.64s)]
*  who, within a generation, are innately conservative. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=140.92s)]
*  And just to finish, you mentioned all of these hypotheticals [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=145.0s)]
*  that were really interesting. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  I could add one modest one. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=149.16s)]
*  As we speak, Tucker, our major universities are in recess. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  There's about four million dorms nationwide, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=155.56s)]
*  right now, that are empty. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=158.64s)]
*  And we hear all this virtual signaling [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  from Stanford, Yale, Princeton. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  These are the ideal places. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=163.92s)]
*  They have open housing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=165.88s)]
*  You can bring in illegal immigrants. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=167.11999999999998s)]
*  You can fly them in. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=169.04s)]
*  They have medical schools that could [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=169.96s)]
*  offer medical assistance. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=171.84s)]
*  They have law schools that could offer legal assistance. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  They have interns that could help with emerging English [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=176.56s)]
*  programs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=179.28s)]
*  This would be the solution to the problem. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=180.08s)]
*  The universities could step up and say, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  we want to reify our rhetoric with concrete action. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=183.56s)]
*  We've got the facilities. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=186.72s)]
*  Bring them in. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  I think it would be a wonderful, noble, and moral experience [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=188.44s)]
*  if our college president stepped up. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  And let him stay. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  Let them repopulate the universities, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=195.4s)]
*  turn over Cornell to MS-13, and make them students [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=197.56s)]
*  in the fall. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=200.28s)]
*  Their endowments can pay for it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=201.44s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=203.56s)]
*  And I love that idea. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=204.56s)]
*  Victor Davis Hanson, thank you so much for suggesting that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=205.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkqwThzvhE&t=208.68s)]
