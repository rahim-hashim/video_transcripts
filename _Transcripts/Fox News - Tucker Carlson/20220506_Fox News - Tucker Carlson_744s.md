# Tucker: This is the road to chaos and collapse
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc)
*  Welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Friday. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=1.5s)]
*  It's pretty hard to argue with people [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=2.9s)]
*  who are passive aggressive. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=4.86s)]
*  You may have tried it before. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  Why are you so angry? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=7.22s)]
*  They scream. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=8.6s)]
*  Stop being violent, they snarl as they punch you in the face. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Passive aggressive people are intent on dominating you, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=14.0s)]
*  but they're too dishonest to admit it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=16.92s)]
*  Now it's not an honorable style of attack, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  but it's very effective, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  mostly because it's so bewildering. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=23.0s)]
*  The Democratic Party practices this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=24.92s)]
*  Democrats will never meet you on an open field of battle. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=27.08s)]
*  Instead, they will sneak up behind you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=30.419999999999998s)]
*  and knock you unconscious with a bag of sanctimony. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  This is the party of weak men and angry women, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=36.0s)]
*  so passive aggression is their only mode of communication. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=38.36s)]
*  If you've ever seen one of Jen Psaki's press conferences, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=42.04s)]
*  you know exactly what we're talking about. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=44.2s)]
*  We watched one of them yesterday, in fact. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=46.0s)]
*  It was her last. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Peter Ducey asked Psaki what the administration thinks [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  of the fact that liberal groups have posted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=51.7s)]
*  the home addresses of conservative Supreme Court justices [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=53.64s)]
*  on the internet. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=56.96s)]
*  Now why are they doing this? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=57.88s)]
*  Well, it's obvious why they're doing it, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=59.04s)]
*  and no one denies why they're doing it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=60.0s)]
*  They're doing it in order to frighten those justices [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=61.72s)]
*  into changing their votes on Roe v. Wade. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=64.84s)]
*  Now that's illegal. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=67.36s)]
*  It's very clearly a federal crime. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=68.34s)]
*  It's also, by the way, the road to chaos and collapse. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  You can't allow angry mobs to make your country's laws. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=73.04s)]
*  That's why we banned lynching. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=77.32s)]
*  But Jen Psaki did not have a problem with this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=79.52s)]
*  People are understandably upset with Sam Alito's views, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=81.64s)]
*  she said, so you shouldn't be surprised. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=84.4s)]
*  They want to express that concern in person [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=86.64s)]
*  by screaming at Sam Alito and his family. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=89.2s)]
*  Quote, I don't have an official U.S. government position [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=91.32s)]
*  on where people should protest. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=94.56s)]
*  Really, Jen Psaki, are those the rules now? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=96.84s)]
*  How would you feel if angry protesters showed up outside, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=99.8s)]
*  say, Michelle Obama's house? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=102.24s)]
*  Of course, they'd be thrown into thumbscrews within minutes [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=104.6s)]
*  and charged with racism, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=106.9s)]
*  and you would applaud as they languished in jail. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=107.92s)]
*  But conservative Supreme Court justices, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=110.76s)]
*  no, that's a different story [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=112.52s)]
*  because conservative Supreme Court justices deserve it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=113.64s)]
*  That's Jen Psaki's position. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=117.24s)]
*  But it is not, in fact, since we've, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  speaking of this topic, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=121.92s)]
*  the official position of the U.S. government. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=123.02s)]
*  No, according to 18 U.S. Code 1507, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=124.86s)]
*  the official position of the U.S. government is, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=128.36s)]
*  you're not allowed to intimidate judges, period. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=130.58s)]
*  Quote, whoever with the intent of interfering with, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=134.24s)]
*  obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=137.52s)]
*  or with the intent of influencing any judge, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=140.16s)]
*  juror, witness, or court officer [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=142.72s)]
*  in the discharge of his duty, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=144.18s)]
*  pickets or parades in or near a building housing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=145.7s)]
*  a court of the United States, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=148.24s)]
*  or in or near a building or residence, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=149.56s)]
*  occupied or used by such judge, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  juror, witness, or court officer, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=154.28s)]
*  or with such intent uses any sound truck or similar device [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=155.94s)]
*  or resorts to any other demonstration [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=158.84s)]
*  in or near any such building or residence, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=160.84s)]
*  shall be fined or imprisoned. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=163.18s)]
*  So it's very clearly a crime. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=166.16s)]
*  Jen Psaki either didn't know this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=168.48s)]
*  or far more likely didn't care [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=170.04s)]
*  because as far as the Biden administration is concerned, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  Justice Alito is responsible [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  for the threats against his family. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  If you don't want to be targeted by a mob, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=178.76s)]
*  then don't write opinions the mob doesn't like, dumbo. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=180.28s)]
*  You did this to yourself. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=183.64s)]
*  It's your fault we're hurting you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=185.04s)]
*  That's always the position of passive aggressive people [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  and it's the position of the passive aggressive party. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=190.56s)]
*  So we recognized it immediately [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=192.56s)]
*  because we watch this stuff for a living. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  And then we saw this and it made us think, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=196.1s)]
*  this ran unseen on this morning. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=198.45999999999998s)]
*  Now for days we have assumed [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  based on quite a bit of evidence [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=201.28s)]
*  that the main threat to Supreme Court justices right now [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=202.76s)]
*  and to our justice system itself [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=205.84s)]
*  comes from groups of activist liberals [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=207.8s)]
*  who are enraged by the idea [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=209.64s)]
*  that Roe v. Wade might be repealed. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=211.7s)]
*  These are the people who are spray painting churches [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=214.52s)]
*  and putting Sam Alito's home address on the internet. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=216.24s)]
*  They're the mob and they're angry [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=218.76s)]
*  and we know why they're angry. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=220.56s)]
*  So the whole thing made sense to us. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=221.58s)]
*  But according to CNN, that's not what's happening. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=223.48s)]
*  In fact, it's the opposite of what's happening. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=225.98s)]
*  The real threat CNN informed us this morning [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=228.48s)]
*  comes not from people who are angry [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  about Sam Alito's opinion, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=233.89999999999998s)]
*  but from people who are happy about it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  So the ones who are celebrating what Sam Alito wrote [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=238.56s)]
*  are the ones who are the real danger [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=241.76s)]
*  to the Supreme Court watch. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  This morning law enforcement officials [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=245.88s)]
*  are preparing for potential violence [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=247.28s)]
*  in the Capitol and nationwide [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=250.0s)]
*  after the leak of that Supreme Court draft opinion [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  that would strike down Roe v. Wade after 50 years. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  Capitol police are warning the far right [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=259.44s)]
*  is calling for violence against a religious group [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=261.08s)]
*  planning to rally for abortion rights. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=264.0s)]
*  Whitney Wilde is live outside the Supreme Court. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=266.68s)]
*  Listen, seeing fences go up there, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  it's sort of like post-January 6. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=271.88s)]
*  What are you seeing and what specific intelligence [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=273.72s)]
*  is warning police officials? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=276.96s)]
*  Well at this point law enforcement sources, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=280.76s)]
*  several of them tell us that they are closely monitoring [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=282.24s)]
*  social media chatter that suggests [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=284.44s)]
*  that there's going to be violence [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=287.28s)]
*  against abortion clinic providers, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=288.11999999999995s)]
*  abortion clinic staff, members of the judiciary, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=289.32s)]
*  that would include the justices here [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=292.08s)]
*  as well as members of the federal government [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=294.08s)]
*  and what we know after January 6th [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  and what law enforcement knows across the country [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=298.44s)]
*  is that social media chatter [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=300.28s)]
*  can manifest into actual violence. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=301.76s)]
*  Sometimes people really do say what they're going to do. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=304.32s)]
*  You got that? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  Law enforcement sources tell CNN [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=309.29999999999995s)]
*  the real threat here is the far right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=311.0s)]
*  The far right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=313.23999999999995s)]
*  Fences are going up outside the Supreme Court [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=314.76s)]
*  as the far right poses a threat. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=316.6s)]
*  The far right is the one you have to watch out for. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  They're the ones whose electronic communications [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  you've got to quote, monitor closely. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=322.82000000000005s)]
*  And that makes sense. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=325.44s)]
*  Now that Roe v. Wade may be going away, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  these people are going to want to bomb [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  as many abortion clinics as they can [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  and hurt as many Supreme Court justices as possible. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=331.6s)]
*  After all, the Supreme Court may get rid of a law [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  that they have hated for 50 years. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=337.48s)]
*  So you can see why they'd be moved to violence [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  against the Supreme Court. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=341.72s)]
*  Now our first response to this was to laugh. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  It seemed too absurd to be real. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=345.42s)]
*  How dumb do they think we are? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=346.66s)]
*  And then we remembered what the president [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=348.54s)]
*  of the United States and his attorney general [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=350.38s)]
*  have been telling us for more than a year. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=351.92s)]
*  They've been telling us that no matter what happens, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=354.6s)]
*  no matter what it may look like, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  the people who did it didn't vote for us. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=358.92s)]
*  Yeah, the people who didn't vote for us [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  are the dangerous ones. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=365.38s)]
*  It's always their fault. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=366.42s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  I have not seen a more dangerous threat to democracy [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=369.1s)]
*  than the invasion of the Capitol. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=372.98s)]
*  The greatest terrorism-related threat [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=375.54s)]
*  that we face in the homeland [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=378.42s)]
*  is the threat of domestic violent extremism. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=380.18s)]
*  According to the intelligence community, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=383.18s)]
*  terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  to the homeland today. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=390.3s)]
*  Not ISIS, not Al-Qaeda, white supremacists. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=391.74s)]
*  Not Al-Qaeda, white supremacy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=398.58000000000004s)]
*  So when we reviewed those tapes, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=402.5s)]
*  it started to make sense. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=403.9s)]
*  Like the Mongols and the Visigoths before them, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=405.54s)]
*  these dreaded white supremacists [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=407.84s)]
*  have declared war on civilization, these Trump voters, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=409.32s)]
*  and the evidence for that is all around us. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=411.82s)]
*  We've just ignored it because on some level, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=413.54s)]
*  we don't wanna know. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=415.06s)]
*  But in retrospect, it was always right in front of us. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=417.3s)]
*  You recall when Trump voters [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=419.26s)]
*  looted that Macy's in New York City. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=420.54s)]
*  They couldn't help themselves. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=422.66s)]
*  That's who they are. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=423.62s)]
*  Then they torched a police precinct in Minneapolis. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=424.46s)]
*  The very symbol of the law, they set it on fire. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=426.82s)]
*  And then they burned a federal building in Portland, Oregon. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=428.98s)]
*  In case you've forgotten what all of these right-wing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=432.82s)]
*  attacks looked like from white supremacists, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=434.70000000000005s)]
*  here's what they did. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=437.1s)]
*  ["The White House is a Murderous City"] [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=439.1s)]
*  We gotta be a screamer! [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=450.54s)]
*  We gotta be a screamer! [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=452.06s)]
*  You're beyond! [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=453.66s)]
*  You wanna get this? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=459.82s)]
*  So you can see why they're putting up barriers [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=469.22s)]
*  in front of the Supreme Court. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=471.94s)]
*  Those people are so happy with Sam Alito's opinion, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=472.94s)]
*  they might start burning and looting again. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=476.52000000000004s)]
*  And of course, that would be consistent [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=478.44s)]
*  with the years-long reign of right-wing terror [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=480.58000000000004s)]
*  we've been living through. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=482.98s)]
*  Because their thirst for anarchy and chaos [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=484.42s)]
*  is never sated. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=486.62s)]
*  At one point, these Trump voters seceded [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=488.3s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=490.54s)]
*  They set up their own nation of lawlessness, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=492.1s)]
*  drugs and squalor, and violence within the very city [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=494.3s)]
*  limits of Seattle. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=496.54s)]
*  Just like the Confederates of 1861, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=498.04s)]
*  but with more weed and spray paint. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=500.02s)]
*  Right in the middle of Seattle. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=501.66s)]
*  Talk about brazen, but that's who they are. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=503.5s)]
*  That could happen in your town. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=505.2s)]
*  No wonder America's abortionist community [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=507.34000000000003s)]
*  is cowering in fear tonight. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=509.24s)]
*  And it gets worse. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=510.7s)]
*  These MAGA people have so little respect for law and order, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=511.92s)]
*  they think nothing of rushing into buildings. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=514.98s)]
*  Department stores, Walgreens, liquor stores, foot locker, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=517.5s)]
*  and just taking what they want. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=520.9s)]
*  They steal armfuls of merchandise off the shelves [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=522.86s)]
*  and walk out the door like it's theirs. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=525.46s)]
*  And then, purely to amuse themselves, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=527.26s)]
*  they push strangers in front of trains [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=529.54s)]
*  and open fire on subway cars. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=531.1s)]
*  They drive trucks through Christmas parades [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=532.82s)]
*  and beat elderly Asian women on the street. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=534.54s)]
*  You can't control these people [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=537.38s)]
*  because they're beyond the reach of logic. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=538.38s)]
*  They are so primitive and superstitious, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=540.22s)]
*  they have come to believe they can defeat nature itself [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=542.3000000000001s)]
*  with magic amulets, like cosmetics and women's clothing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=544.74s)]
*  They think they're shapeshifters. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=547.66s)]
*  You can change their physical form at will. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=549.02s)]
*  Just become something different. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=552.46s)]
*  You're seeing one on your screen right now. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=555.1s)]
*  People like this don't believe in history or science. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=557.02s)]
*  They're barely literate. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=559.16s)]
*  So they communicate instead [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=560.26s)]
*  in grunts and unintelligible sounds. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=561.46s)]
*  Here's the leader, the chief of their tribe, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=563.74s)]
*  speaking in a language only they can understand. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=566.14s)]
*  So the best way to get something done, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=569.34s)]
*  if it holds near and dear to you [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=571.62s)]
*  that you like to be able to... [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=574.26s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=578.62s)]
*  What did he just say? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=581.46s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=582.98s)]
*  You'd have to be a right supremacist maga person [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=583.8199999999999s)]
*  to understand. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=585.74s)]
*  It's an esoteric language. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=586.58s)]
*  These primitives adorn their bodies [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=588.1s)]
*  with fantastic decorations. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=589.58s)]
*  They dress in costume. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=590.86s)]
*  Some even push pieces of metal through their faces [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=592.18s)]
*  in order to look fierce. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=594.9s)]
*  Look at them in their war paint. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=596.38s)]
*  Hi, my name's Alice and I'm a preschool teacher. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=598.34s)]
*  Recently we started wearing pronoun pins [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=600.62s)]
*  and the kids get to pick a new pronoun pin every... [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=602.86s)]
*  We have some that pick like she, her every single day [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  and we have some that change it up. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=608.6999999999999s)]
*  So I'm a non-binary preschool teacher [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=610.18s)]
*  and my kids know I'm non-binary. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=612.5799999999999s)]
*  They know I'm not a girl or a boy. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=614.78s)]
*  I use they, them pronouns in the classroom. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=616.52s)]
*  We work on it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=618.66s)]
*  Not all the kids get it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=619.5s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=620.3399999999999s)]
*  And I go by mixed gray in the classroom, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=621.3s)]
*  not miss or mister. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=623.4599999999999s)]
*  Man, y'all thought me teaching the children [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=624.8199999999999s)]
*  about me being Polly was crazy. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=627.54s)]
*  But not only that, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=630.6999999999999s)]
*  but they also know that I'm gender fluid. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=632.3s)]
*  I'm gonna give you my explanation [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=634.78s)]
*  about what it means to be transgender as well. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=636.54s)]
*  So when babies are born, the doctor looks at them [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=639.26s)]
*  and they make a guess about whether the baby [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=641.78s)]
*  is a boy or a girl. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=644.26s)]
*  Kids as young as three and four [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=645.6999999999999s)]
*  are actually aware of their gender identity, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=647.18s)]
*  even if they don't have the language for it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=648.9s)]
*  To say that pre-K through third grade [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=650.38s)]
*  are not ready for such topics [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=652.5s)]
*  is actually internalized homophobia and transphobia. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=654.28s)]
*  Margaret Mead wrote about people like this, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=657.66s)]
*  anti-social elements that are a feature of any society. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=659.78s)]
*  But in our case, the MAGA people number in the millions. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=662.5s)]
*  You saw just a few on your screen. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=666.22s)]
*  And because there are so many, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=667.68s)]
*  they threaten the very foundations of our civil society. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=669.4s)]
*  It's like Alejandro Mayorkas [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=671.8199999999999s)]
*  and the attorney general have warned us. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=673.3399999999999s)]
*  They are so powerful that courts and legislators [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=675.52s)]
*  bow before their rage. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=678.18s)]
*  Prosecutors can't even restrain them, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=679.66s)]
*  but instead do their bidding. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=681.38s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=682.42s)]
*  Because they're afraid not to. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=683.6s)]
*  Do you remember what the MAGA people did to Minneapolis [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=685.78s)]
*  when a jury dared to convict [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=688.62s)]
*  their spiritual leader, Derek Chauvin? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=690.0200000000001s)]
*  The MAGA people stormed the jail, freed Chauvin, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=691.9000000000001s)]
*  then carried him on their shoulders [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=694.26s)]
*  back to their guerrilla camps in the mountains, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=695.7s)]
*  where they danced triumphantly before bonfires [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=697.58s)]
*  made of back issues of the Atlantic magazine, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=699.6600000000001s)]
*  howling into the night sky. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=701.5400000000001s)]
*  And then, as an indelible lesson to the rest of us, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=703.1800000000001s)]
*  they returned to the city of Minneapolis and sacked it, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=705.46s)]
*  because that's what they do [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=708.5400000000001s)]
*  when they don't agree with the jury decision. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=710.34s)]
*  They riot. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=712.74s)]
*  That's what the MAGA people are like, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=713.82s)]
*  and that's where they're the greatest threat we face. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=715.12s)]
*  Do you remember that moment? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=716.9s)]
*  We saved the tape. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=717.74s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, here are the MAGA people. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=718.6999999999999s)]
*  Everybody out here join in. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=721.34s)]
*  We love being together as a family. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=723.1s)]
*  We play morbid at stomach turning. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=728.9399999999999s)]
*  Ask Jen Psaki what it looked like. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=731.54s)]
*  She's never recovered from it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFR32oNfrDc&t=732.74s)]
