# Tucker Carlson: Investors didn't notice this red flag in FTX scandal
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys)
*  Oh, we're in the real Hollywood in the free state of Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=0.0s)]
*  Here for the Patriot Awards, a highlight of the year. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=11.88s)]
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=14.48s)]
*  The collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX is, even if you're not interested in cryptocurrency, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=16.8s)]
*  a history changing event. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=24.2s)]
*  It may turn out to be the biggest single day loss of assets in the history of money. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=26.0s)]
*  Billions of dollars evaporated in just moments and it's still not clear what happened to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=32.56s)]
*  a lot of that money. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  It just disappeared. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=36.86s)]
*  And as it did, it sparked a growing financial crisis across entire sectors of the economy, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=38.34s)]
*  a disaster that quite possibly could get very worse very soon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=42.44s)]
*  But the story of the FTX implosion is bigger even than the global recession it may cause. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=47.66s)]
*  It is the story of the complete and utter corruption of the people who run our country. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=54.06s)]
*  The very people who should have been covering and regulating and reigning in FTX and its [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  30 year old founder, Sam Bankman Fried, were instead profiting from the scam. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=65.62s)]
*  Not just a few of them, nearly all of them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=71.06s)]
*  From the news media paid off by Sam Bankman Fried to the leadership of the Democratic [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  Party, also paid off by Sam Bankman Fried, to the chairman of the Securities and Exchange [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=79.36s)]
*  Commission, the SEC commissioner himself, Gary Gensler. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=84.17999999999999s)]
*  They all knew that FTX was not a real company and that Sam Bankman Fried was a fraud. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=88.32s)]
*  And if they didn't know that, they certainly should have known that because it was very [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  obvious to anyone who bothered to pay attention. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=99.02s)]
*  One of the few who did pay attention was a short seller called Mark Cahodes who took [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  one look at Sam Bankman Fried, SBF for short, and recognized here is a con artist, obviously. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=107.46s)]
*  Watch this tape which aired on Hedge Eye TV, a small investment advice channel, back in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=116.1s)]
*  October. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=120.5s)]
*  When anyone tries to pin SBF down on where he made his money, you can't get a cogent [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=122.0s)]
*  answer. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=129.0s)]
*  We need to take into account that SBF is bailing out known ponzies and frauds in the crypto [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=130.0s)]
*  space. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=140.34s)]
*  Everyone who's gone bankrupt or is a proven fraud. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=142.0s)]
*  But nothing here fits. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=145.82s)]
*  Everything reads like this thing is a complete scam. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=149.24s)]
*  And I think this thing is dirty and rotten to the core. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=153.08s)]
*  So if that guy on a small audience investment channel could tell that Sam Bankman Fried [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=160.94s)]
*  was a fraud, where was Gary Gensler of the SEC? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=168.76s)]
*  By the way, the tell in the sentence you just heard is that Sam Bankman Fried couldn't [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=174.38s)]
*  explain where he got his money. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=178.88s)]
*  Here you are a 30-year-old billionaire. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=181.38s)]
*  How'd you do that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=185.18s)]
*  If you can't tell us, then maybe that's a red flag and you would think most investors [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=187.1s)]
*  would have recognized it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=191.4s)]
*  But for the most part, they didn't. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=193.24s)]
*  Nor do they seem to notice the obvious incompetence of Sam Bankman Fried's business partner slash [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=195.64s)]
*  girlfriend, Caroline Ellison. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=201.0s)]
*  Ellison was totally and obviously unqualified for the job she claimed to have. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=203.44s)]
*  She had no track record of success at anything. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=208.66s)]
*  She reportedly wrote online about her drug use. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=211.98s)]
*  And then on a podcast back in May, months before the collapse, Caroline Ellison just [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=215.08s)]
*  came out and admitted that she had no idea what she was doing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=220.36s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that you have been able to pull this thing off without your mathematics degree [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  or it has been the pillar of your trading activity? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=230.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely could pull it off without my math degree. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=235.12s)]
*  Use very little math. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=239.72000000000003s)]
*  When you start out as like an intern and you do something and accidentally lose maybe [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=240.98s)]
*  a thousand dollars for your desk, you're like, oh God, everyone's going to hate me now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=245.98s)]
*  This is terrible. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=250.32s)]
*  And over time, you have to sort of get comfortable with larger and larger swings of money. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=252.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of a good example of a trade where I've lost a ton of money. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=262.7s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=271.34s)]
*  I probably don't want to go into specifics too much with that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=272.34s)]
*  Oh, I've lost a ton of money. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=277.26s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=280.02s)]
*  It's not mine. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=281.02s)]
*  And no, there's no math here at the cryptocurrency exchange. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=282.02s)]
*  Let's send her billions of dollars. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=287.06s)]
*  Lost a lot of money. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=289.94s)]
*  I've lost a lot of money that investors, including institutional investors, including individuals [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=291.18s)]
*  who are hoping to retire with that money, all gone because we don't do math. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=297.3s)]
*  It's so outdated. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=302.5s)]
*  But here's the amazing thing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=303.5s)]
*  None of this seemed to phase the biggest institutional investors. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=305.98s)]
*  Sequoia, their entire job is to what? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=310.18s)]
*  Assess risk. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=313.02s)]
*  But it wasn't really about risk and reward. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=314.02s)]
*  It was about something else. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=317.06s)]
*  Earlier this year, Michael Grimes, a former spokesman for Bill Clinton, who seemed to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=318.26000000000005s)]
*  be making an awful lot of money somehow in the financial world, approached Elon Musk, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=321.3s)]
*  the world's richest man, with an investment offer on behalf of SBS. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=325.38s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried wants you to invest. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=329.14000000000004s)]
*  Elon Musk didn't get to be the richest man on the planet by investing in things like [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=331.42s)]
*  that, so he apparently smelled BS and turned Grimes down. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=335.1s)]
*  But in their exchange, which has since become public, Grimes multiple times told Musk that, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=339.62s)]
*  By the way, Sam Bankman Fried is a huge donor to the Democratic Party. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=344.9s)]
*  Quote, major Democratic donor, Grimes wrote to Musk, second to Bloomberg in donations [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=348.7s)]
*  to Biden campaign. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  What does that have to do with the investment? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=355.5s)]
*  It should be irrelevant, but that was the substance of the pitch. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=358.0s)]
*  What is this exactly? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=361.73999999999995s)]
*  It doesn't quite sound like a business. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=362.73999999999995s)]
*  It sounds like a hybrid of some kind and not in a reassuring way. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=365.4s)]
*  Now some of this was happening in secret, but a lot of it was happening right out in [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=370.26s)]
*  public, right in front of the news media. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=373.38s)]
*  And of course, a lot of them knew Sam Bankman Fried because he was sending a lot of the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=375.94s)]
*  money. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=380.18s)]
*  And when he wasn't, he was desperate for the publicity they could provide. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=381.18s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried was on the cover of more magazines than Madonna. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=384.06s)]
*  So they probably should have been asking questions about his business, but none of them did. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=388.2s)]
*  They promoted him. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=392.48s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=393.98s)]
*  They call him the JPMorgan of crypto, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=394.98s)]
*  Yeah, the Michael Jordan of crypto, if you will. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=400.06s)]
*  So why should you care about a floppy haired, vegan, fidget spinning crypto billionaire [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=403.82s)]
*  who occasionally sleeps on a beanbag chair? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=408.14s)]
*  During the so-called crypto winter, the 30 year old CEO has been referred to as crypto's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=411.1s)]
*  white knight. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=415.46s)]
*  JPMorgan of this generation, Sam Bankman Fried's FTS. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=416.46s)]
*  Is he the J.P. Gould of our era or is he the JPMorgan of our era? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=422.8s)]
*  I think it's yet to be determined. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=426.74s)]
*  Is he Vanderbilt? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=429.78s)]
*  He could be. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=430.78s)]
*  Is he Harriman? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=431.78s)]
*  Possibly. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=432.78s)]
*  Is he the credit mogulier scandal? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=433.78s)]
*  Is he Carnegie? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=436.78s)]
*  If he gives a lot of libraries, he is. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=439.78s)]
*  He's the JPMorgan of finance, of crypto. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=442.78s)]
*  He's the Michael Jordan of crypto. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=447.78s)]
*  But wait a second. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=449.78s)]
*  Michael Jordan's not in crypto. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=450.78s)]
*  He played basketball. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=452.38s)]
*  Well, Sam Bankman Fried's not really in crypto either. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=453.38s)]
*  How are we all getting rich? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=456.38s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=458.62s)]
*  Don't ask questions. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=459.62s)]
*  He's the JPMorgan. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=460.62s)]
*  He'll be a trillionaire. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=461.62s)]
*  So, why were all these people pushing a scam that any normal person, even a person with [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=463.62s)]
*  no background in finance and a sort of elementary understanding of profit-loss equations could [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=468.82s)]
*  have seen was probably going to collapse in the end? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=475.34s)]
*  Now, we're not sure. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=477.62s)]
*  Stupidity clearly plays a role. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=479.02s)]
*  So does the herd instinct. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=481.02s)]
*  So, all we can ask really is who was benefiting from all of this? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=482.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, we know that the Democratic Party benefited, as we told you. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=485.98s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried donated $40 million to Democrats this cycle. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=488.98s)]
*  That's more than any other donor apart from Soros. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=491.98s)]
*  Then he pledged another billion dollars for the next election, a billion dollars in one [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=494.98s)]
*  election, because that's democracy. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=498.98s)]
*  He wasn't doing this in private. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=501.98s)]
*  He was bragging about it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=503.98s)]
*  And then he was going on in public about how politicians, Democratic politicians, were [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=504.98s)]
*  begging him for money. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=508.98s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=509.98s)]
*  So, how do you find political fundraisers? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=511.98s)]
*  They come to you directly? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=513.98s)]
*  Is it easy to get to you and say, we need this money for this candidate? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=515.02s)]
*  And what type of candidates do you tend to support? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=518.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=520.02s)]
*  Well, if you, if I pulled out my phone here and just looked at my last 10 text messages, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=521.02s)]
*  you know, about half of them are going to be people asking for, you know, politicians [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=524.02s)]
*  asking for contributions. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=528.02s)]
*  So, why were you telling us this in public? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=532.02s)]
*  And by the way, if you're shaking like a naked man in a snowstorm in the middle of an interview, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=536.02s)]
*  maybe there's something wrong with you. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=542.02s)]
*  Send that boy another billion dollars. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=544.06s)]
*  So, how substantial are we overstating this? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=547.06s)]
*  We're making it partisan points that things collapsed. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=549.06s)]
*  It was clearly a Ponzi. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=551.06s)]
*  Are we trying to attack the Democratic Party now? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=552.06s)]
*  No, it's actually justified. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=555.06s)]
*  This guy was a major donor, major donor. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=557.06s)]
*  According to the head of Citadel, defeating Donald Trump was literally on the balance [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=560.06s)]
*  sheet of FTX. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=565.06s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=566.06s)]
*  FTX crosses into a zone that all of us are worried about. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=567.0999999999999s)]
*  You know, on the balance sheet of FTX is a line called Trump lose. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  And Sam was the second biggest donor to Democratic candidates. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=579.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to leave it to everybody else to draw their own conclusions about what you're [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=586.0999999999999s)]
*  saying here. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=590.0999999999999s)]
*  The other reporter says, we're out of time. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=591.14s)]
*  We can't go too deeply into that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=593.14s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=594.14s)]
*  Let's go more deeply into it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=595.14s)]
*  It's pretty interesting. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=596.14s)]
*  So, of course, politicians loved the guy because he was just a cash spigot and that's what [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=597.14s)]
*  they want most. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=601.14s)]
*  But where were the regulators? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=602.14s)]
*  Because there is a government that's supposed to be independent of officeholders, a regulatory [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=604.14s)]
*  state that keeps Ponzi's from happening. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=609.14s)]
*  Where were they? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=611.14s)]
*  Well, Sam Bankman Fried was himself invited to one of the most important meetings in the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=612.14s)]
*  world. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=617.18s)]
*  And then he posed for a picture with Maxine Waters, who's the head financial regulator [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=618.18s)]
*  in the Congress. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=622.18s)]
*  And then the Washington Post, which is the hometown newspaper of government, did no reporting [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=623.18s)]
*  on his actual business. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=628.18s)]
*  They just wrote a puff piece about how cool is it that the guy with funky hair can't sit [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=629.18s)]
*  still and sleeps on a bean bag is getting super rich. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=634.18s)]
*  How do you pull this off? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=639.18s)]
*  I mean, I'm not going to lie. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=640.18s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=641.18s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=642.18s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=643.18s)]
*  They're really rich! [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=644.2199999999999s)]
*  How do you pull this scam? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=647.2199999999999s)]
*  How do they do that? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=648.2199999999999s)]
*  Well, they did it with religion. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=649.2199999999999s)]
*  That's the quickest way to blind people. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=651.2199999999999s)]
*  If they think you share a common faith, maybe they'll ignore it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=653.2199999999999s)]
*  And that religion is effective altruism. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=656.2199999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of effective altruists. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=658.26s)]
*  Maybe you haven't heard of that. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=661.18s)]
*  It is a kind of religious movement. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=662.2199999999999s)]
*  It's very popular in the tech world and the finance world throughout Silicon Valley and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=664.2199999999999s)]
*  parts of New York. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=669.24s)]
*  The idea is that you make money not because you're greedy, not because you have a bottomless [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=670.22s)]
*  pit inside you of need that can never be filled, but because you want to help other people [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=676.0400000000001s)]
*  and you want to help them in the most efficient way. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=681.24s)]
*  You want to benefit the greatest numbers of people in the most efficient way. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=683.6800000000001s)]
*  So that means effective altruists get to underpay their housekeepers, they get to stiff the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=687.84s)]
*  waiter on the tip, and of course they need those to say they do, but that's okay because [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=692.12s)]
*  they're deeply concerned about abstract tragedies like global warming. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=696.3s)]
*  So if nothing else, effective altruism gives you a moral cover as you rip off investors [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=700.26s)]
*  in order to live tax-free in splendor in some beachfront paradise as Sam Bankman Fried did [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=705.0999999999999s)]
*  and to this day continues to do. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=710.3399999999999s)]
*  He's still in Albany in the Bahamas. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=712.2199999999999s)]
*  So it goes without saying that Sam Bankman Fried talked a lot about effective altruism [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=714.6999999999999s)]
*  and in return FTX enjoyed a very high ESG score, higher than Exxon, which gets your [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=718.26s)]
*  ambulance to the hospital and your plane in the air to see your kids and heats your home. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=725.2800000000001s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried was considered a moral leader even as he was ripping off millions of people. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  But no one benefited long term from FTX's collapse or will benefit more than government [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=735.76s)]
*  regulators. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=740.24s)]
*  They are pointing to FTX and demanding more control over cryptocurrency and ultimately [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=741.48s)]
*  the end of the cash economy. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=746.6s)]
*  Why do we think they're going to do that? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=749.0400000000001s)]
*  Because they're already working on it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=750.6400000000001s)]
*  The SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce said this week the demise of XTS could be a quote catalyst [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=752.32s)]
*  for more regulation. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=758.32s)]
*  So why should you worry about that? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=760.32s)]
*  Well, because as we saw in Canada last year, crypto is a huge problem for governments. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=761.84s)]
*  Governments can't control, ideally, cryptocurrency. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=768.36s)]
*  You can't freeze someone's personal cold wallet with crypto in it if you don't like what they [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=770.8000000000001s)]
*  say. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=776.24s)]
*  So what does this have to do with the collapse of FTX? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=777.24s)]
*  Well, it turns out that Sam Bankman Fried's girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, has a lot of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=780.4000000000001s)]
*  connections to regulators. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  In fact, the biggest regulator of all in this country. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=785.84s)]
*  Her father Glenn is an MIT professor who worked at that university alongside, drum roll please, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=788.36s)]
*  Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, which is in charge of cryptocurrency regulation. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=793.96s)]
*  FTX's general counsel used to work with Gensler on the Commodities Future Trading Commission. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=798.72s)]
*  Now Gensler is about to get a lot more power. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=803.24s)]
*  So this thing swells to unsustainable size and inevitably implodes. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=806.28s)]
*  It collapses and that collapse is used for a pretext to do what they've been planning [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=813.36s)]
*  to do all along. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  So it probably shouldn't shock you that right after FTX's collapse, every major bank in [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=819.4s)]
*  this country announced a new partnership with the New York Fed to establish a new digital [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=822.9599999999999s)]
*  currency. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=826.6s)]
*  Oh, digital currency. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=827.6s)]
*  The one they can regulate and control. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=828.6s)]
*  Kitty Group, Wells Fargo, MasterCard, HSBC, all working on a 12-week digital dollar pilot. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=831.12s)]
*  The Fed describes this project as a regulated liability network. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=837.5600000000001s)]
*  So what does this mean long term? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=841.52s)]
*  Well, if they have control of your money because it's digital, you can't stash it under your [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=843.68s)]
*  bed. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=848.4s)]
*  If they don't like what you say, they can turn it off and you're impoverished. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=849.4s)]
*  In other words, this whole thing is a bigger scam even that it seems and it was made possible [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=852.16s)]
*  by political sloganeering. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=859.2s)]
*  And Sam Bankman Fried, if nothing else, is not stupid and he knows that well. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=860.66s)]
*  As he put it in a message to a reporter the other day from his hideout in the Bahamas, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=864.4599999999999s)]
*  the woke posturing is the most effective possible business boy. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=868.18s)]
*  And we're quoting, I feel bad for those who get f'd by it, he wrote, by this dumb game [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=871.3399999999999s)]
*  we woke Westerners play where we all say the right shibboleths and everyone likes us. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaxEK-lDVys&t=876.02s)]
