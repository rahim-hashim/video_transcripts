# East Palestine residents praise Donald Trump's visit
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg)
*  John Rourke with Blue Line Moving joins us right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=0.0s)]
*  John, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=3.24s)]
*  What did you see there? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=5.2s)]
*  I'm embarrassed to say we have not been there, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  but what was your impression [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=7.96s)]
*  of what's happening in East Palestine? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=8.94s)]
*  My impression, Tucker, thanks for having me on, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=11.64s)]
*  is that the folks there are a whole lot more motivated [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=13.64s)]
*  than they were at this time yesterday, and that's a fact. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=17.3s)]
*  The fact that President Biden has refused to come [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=21.36s)]
*  to this small town when he's supposed to be Scranton Jo, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=24.84s)]
*  a small town hero of the working man, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=28.0s)]
*  and he can't even show his face in a town [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=30.44s)]
*  of American citizens that need his leadership, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=32.96s)]
*  that need the government's help terribly, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=35.96s)]
*  and he proved what everybody, I think, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  already knew in this country, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=41.24s)]
*  is that he's not the leader for this country, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=42.56s)]
*  and that Donald J. Trump is the leader [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  that we all know he is, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  and he is the leader of this country, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=48.7s)]
*  and he proved that today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=50.16s)]
*  That was leadership that I saw today. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  I saw people standing on the streets, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=53.92s)]
*  screaming for this man, chanting, USA, USA. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=55.64s)]
*  I mean, it just gives me goosebumps, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=59.56s)]
*  and to have President Trump personally thank me, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it almost brought me to tears, man, to be honest. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=65.88s)]
*  I'm just a humble guy, I'm a working man, a family man, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=69.44s)]
*  and to be able to have someone like him thank me personally [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=72.52s)]
*  was a big deal for me and my family. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=77.0s)]
*  I bet it was. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=79.8s)]
*  So really, just kind of big picture for one second, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=80.98s)]
*  since you were there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=84.12s)]
*  2015, Trump emerges out of nowhere, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  then he becomes the nominee, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=88.08s)]
*  and the media starts saying, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=89.32s)]
*  wait, there are a lot of forgotten people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=90.16s)]
*  in forgotten towns, towns that built this country, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  people who were born here and have been completely ignored. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  Maybe we should pay some attention to these people [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=96.28s)]
*  who were dying younger than the rest of us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=99.36s)]
*  I don't think that ever happened. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  Did the people of East Palestine, who you spoke to, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=104.32s)]
*  feel like anyone was paying attention to them in power? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=110.94s)]
*  I mean, these people need help, okay? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=111.96s)]
*  We're putting illegal aliens in hotels [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  and five-star accommodations in New York City, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  and the people of East Palestine [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=120.0s)]
*  can't even get a real hotel to stay in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=121.4s)]
*  for a significant amount of time, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=123.4s)]
*  or some real money that they can actually go maybe [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  and get their own VRBO or something like that, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=128.28s)]
*  somewhere where they can actually take a month [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=130.44s)]
*  and get away from the town, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=133.12s)]
*  and get away from breathing in that nasty air, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=134.56s)]
*  and having to see hundreds of workers, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=137.04s)]
*  every river, every tributary has hoses in it, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=139.58s)]
*  aerators in it, and they're spraying water [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=142.52s)]
*  into these rivers, and who knows [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=145.64s)]
*  where the water's coming from. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=146.48s)]
*  People don't have any idea what the hell is going on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  in their town right now in East Palestine. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=151.88s)]
*  They have no idea, and that's because of people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  like Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=156.6s)]
*  They literally have no idea what they're doing, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=158.88s)]
*  and that's why they're not there, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=161.76s)]
*  because someone will call them out, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  and that's what they're afraid of. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=165.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=167.44s)]
*  Those guys are very lucky that rural America [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=168.56s)]
*  is peaceful and law-abiding. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=170.48s)]
*  They really are, unlike a lot of cities [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=172.0s)]
*  that wouldn't put up with this for one second. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=174.2s)]
*  John Rourke, appreciate it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fl9VLV5mg&t=175.83999999999997s)]
