# Apple is willing to engage in global censorship: David Sacks
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0)
*  But in the meantime, we are very happy to be joined by David Sacks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=0.0s)]
*  He's one of the founders of PayPal. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=3.2s)]
*  He spent the last 25 years as a major figure in the tech world and has been watching very [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=4.96s)]
*  carefully what's happening with Elon Musk after the acquisition of Twitter. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=8.84s)]
*  David Sacks, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=13.36s)]
*  So if Apple did this, it would, it seems like it would effectively destroy Twitter as the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=15.64s)]
*  force that it currently is. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=24.04s)]
*  That would be an abuse of monopoly power. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=25.72s)]
*  I think everyone would agree. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=27.0s)]
*  What can be done to stop that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, yeah, I agree with you, Tucker, that what Apple is doing in China is not that different [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=29.72s)]
*  from what Apple is doing in the U.S. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=36.04s)]
*  They are willing to engage in censorship on a global basis on behalf of their true paymasters. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=37.6s)]
*  And by paymasters, I don't mean consumers. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=43.36s)]
*  Apple has them completely locked up. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  What I mean is the party in power, whether that's in Beijing or Washington. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=46.8s)]
*  This is the quid pro quo that MAGA Democrats have made. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=51.2s)]
*  Of course, by MAGA Democrats, I'm referring to Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=54.96s)]
*  They have the most lucrative monopolies in history and want to continue minting money [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=59.64s)]
*  undisturbed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=62.8s)]
*  And in exchange for that, they will donate lavishly to the Democratic Party. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=63.8s)]
*  And they're willing to kneecap their political opponents with censorship if that's what the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=67.28s)]
*  party in power requires. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=71.56s)]
*  You know, the traditional libertarian position on this, which I ascribe to for many years, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=74.64s)]
*  I'll just say it, was that, you know, the First Amendment protects Americans from having [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=78.28s)]
*  their speech hampered by the government. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=82.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=84.92s)]
*  But all speech takes place online at this point. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=85.92s)]
*  We know that there are direct connections between the tech companies and the government [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  currently in power. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=90.4s)]
*  They're censoring people the direction of the U.S. government. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=91.6s)]
*  So really, if you censor Twitter, you're eliminating my right to speak freely as an American, which [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=94.52s)]
*  is a constitutional problem. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=100.12s)]
*  So why can't someone take action against this? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=101.76s)]
*  Tucker, I think you're right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=104.68s)]
*  I mean, what's basically happened here is that the government has found a kind of loophole [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=107.04s)]
*  in the First Amendment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  The First Amendment is stated it only applies to government, to Congress. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=111.58s)]
*  But if the government can basically get big tech to do its censorship for it, it can claim [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=115.46s)]
*  that this was done by private actors. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=121.3s)]
*  The problem is that the town square has been privatized. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=123.22s)]
*  When content got digitized, it got centralized in the hands of a few big tech companies. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=127.05999999999999s)]
*  And the problem here, though, is that these big tech companies aren't just acting on their [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=132.42s)]
*  own. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=135.94s)]
*  They're acting, you know, at the behest of the government in Washington. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=136.94s)]
*  And, you know, whether it's the Biden administration or various senators on the judiciary committee, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  they have suggested to these companies that their monopolies might be broken up if they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=147.14s)]
*  don't take down more content. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  And so big tech has gotten the message. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=152.32s)]
*  They want their monopolies to continue undisturbed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=154.33999999999997s)]
*  They want to keep minting money. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=156.7s)]
*  And so they are responding by practicing the censorship. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=158.2s)]
*  I just got to finally ask you a personal question. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  So you've been in this business, at the top of this business, you know, all your life [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=164.26s)]
*  effectively. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=167.98s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen everything in the tech world. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=168.98s)]
*  Are you shocked to learn that Apple was preventing nonviolent protesters in China from communicating [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=170.5s)]
*  with each other? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=176.48s)]
*  It is pretty shocking because the way that it was done, Tucker, was they had an update. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=179.54s)]
*  It was like 16.1.1 or something like that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=184.34s)]
*  And they didn't say normally what they do is when they do an update, they put in the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=187.1s)]
*  release notes what they're changing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=192.02s)]
*  And they said in the release notes they were changing, you know, doing bug fixes and so [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=194.14s)]
*  on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=197.18s)]
*  They were limiting the use of this airdrop feature. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=199.02s)]
*  Normally Apple is very proud of their releases and they're eager to tell consumers what it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=201.66s)]
*  is that they're doing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=206.46s)]
*  But in this case, for some reason, they didn't mention it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=207.96s)]
*  And you have to wonder why. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  It's so dark. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=212.34s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=213.34s)]
*  And I know that you come on this show and speak your mind at some cost yourself, given [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=214.34s)]
*  the world that you live in. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=218.94s)]
*  So I'm appreciative that you're willing to. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=219.94s)]
*  David Sachs, thank you very much. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=221.66s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=223.46s)]
*  To Catch Our Nightly Opens, stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=228.18s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_yOBnHyP0&t=233.46s)]
