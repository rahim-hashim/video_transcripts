# How has Miami reached a multi-decade low in homicides?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8)
*  Spent a lot of time telling you how the cities are falling apart and most of them seem to be but not all of them are. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's a pretty amazing success story. We're not exactly sure why it's happening but we're going to try and find out right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=5.84s)]
*  The city of Miami is on track for the lowest crime rate since the 1930s. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=11.44s)]
*  Since Al Capone moved there. Why? What are they doing that no one else is doing? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=18.72s)]
*  Francis Suarez is the mayor of Miami. He joins us now. Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=23.04s)]
*  I wish we'd done this story earlier. I wasn't even aware of it till today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=28.48s)]
*  What exactly are you doing in Miami that America's other cities are not doing? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=31.92s)]
*  Well, I'm going to blow your mind away. We actually increased funding for police. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=38.56s)]
*  So we have the most police officers we've ever had in our history. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=42.0s)]
*  We've also lowered taxes to the lowest level in recorded history, which has prompted tremendous growth. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=46.0s)]
*  We grew 12 percent. I think it's the second most in recorded history as well. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=52.0s)]
*  We have a 1.4 percent unemployment. We're the happiest city in America and the healthiest city in America. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=56.32s)]
*  So it turns out if people are healthy, they're happy, they're working, they're not paying a lot of taxes, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=62.08s)]
*  and they see an increased police presence, they don't have a tendency to commit murder. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=67.28s)]
*  And that's what's been the Miami miracle story, which is a huge contrast to the Washington nightmare story [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=73.12s)]
*  that you've articulated tonight and over the last few weeks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=80.48s)]
*  So there's this great video floating around the internet, I assume it's real, of the riots [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=84.08s)]
*  in the early summer of 2020. And people came to Miami and decided they were going to riot. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=88.48s)]
*  And all these Miami cops came out of a patrol car and say, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=93.68s)]
*  it's our city, we're not doing that here. We're just not doing that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=97.12s)]
*  Did you ever have meaningful riots in Miami? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=100.48s)]
*  We really didn't, because like you said, we drew the line in the sand. And we said, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=104.64s)]
*  you're not going to hurt people, you're not going to destroy property. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=108.08s)]
*  That's something we're just not going to tolerate in our city. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=110.88s)]
*  And so I think the first night we had some issues, but right away, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  I think it was pretty clear that we weren't going to tolerate it, we weren't going to accept it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=119.2s)]
*  And so whoever came in from out of town obviously realized that Miami wasn't a place that was going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  to accept that kind of behavior and left and went somewhere else to create havoc over there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  What's so funny is that for a long time, beginning in probably around 1980, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=134.0s)]
*  for at least a decade after, Miami was famous, fairly or not, for crime. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=138.64s)]
*  It was a whole TV show about it, Miami Vice. Is it kind of weird to be now famous for being safe? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=142.64s)]
*  I grew up in Miami. I was born and raised there. I was born in 1977. In the 80s, we had [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=150.88s)]
*  300 plus homicides. Right now, and I knock on wood here in the studio, we are at 28 year to date. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=155.92s)]
*  So from 300 plus to 28, and we're hoping the trend continues for the rest of the year. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=162.88s)]
*  Literally, we had to look back in our archives to see when was the last time we were ever that low. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  And so like I said, it's really a trusted and true formula for success. We keep taxes low, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=173.68s)]
*  we keep people safe, and we lean into innovation to create high paying jobs. It's sort of the Miami [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=180.8s)]
*  story and it's something that should be scaled across America. It's pretty incredible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  Murders are the one thing that are pretty easy to measure. So there's kind of no lying about how [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=190.96s)]
*  many murders you have. That's why it's just an amazing story. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=194.56s)]
*  Absolutely. Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for joining us. Francis Suarez of Miami. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=197.44s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0RPu13yV8&t=201.92000000000002s)]
