# Candace Owens addresses 'Botox Gate': Everyone is starting to look the same
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM)
*  We just thought this was interesting and worth addressing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=0.0s)]
*  So Candace Owens raised a pretty relevant question [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=3.1s)]
*  the other day on social media and got a huge response. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=7.44s)]
*  She wrote this, serious question for me. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=9.8s)]
*  Do you think that the Botox filler fake lips [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=11.44s)]
*  look attractive? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=13.98s)]
*  Now that's a real question [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=16.14s)]
*  because all of a sudden everybody in power has fake faces. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=18.22s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi looks like Michael Jackson, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=21.12s)]
*  not being mean, but it's true. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=22.68s)]
*  The governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=24.36s)]
*  clearly keeping Botox stock afloat single-handedly [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=26.72s)]
*  and then men are in on it too. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=30.32s)]
*  What part of Joe Biden is still real? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  None. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=34.66s)]
*  Jeff Bezos completely transformed by this stuff. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=35.78s)]
*  So we thought we would ask Candace Owens, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=39.0s)]
*  like what's going on here? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=40.96s)]
*  Is this a sign of something deeper, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=43.06s)]
*  a deeper fakeness infecting our leadership class? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=45.06s)]
*  Candace Owens is of course the host [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=48.46s)]
*  of the Candace Owens Show. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=49.84s)]
*  We're happy to have her now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=51.34s)]
*  Okay, so Candace, what, I mean, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=52.68s)]
*  you address the most sensitive topics in American life, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=54.6s)]
*  race, religion, like you're not afraid of anything, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=58.5s)]
*  but this got a huge response, why? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=60.66s)]
*  Oh man, Botox gate. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=65.58s)]
*  I was very surprised. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  I landed myself in a puddle of uh-oh [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=68.2s)]
*  and I'm laughing out loud now [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=70.02s)]
*  because I can never look at that photo of Nancy, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=71.22s)]
*  Nancy's eyebrows and not chuckle to myself. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=73.42s)]
*  But yeah, I've been very curious [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=76.36s)]
*  and I cover this on my podcast all the time, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=77.88s)]
*  talking about our psychological immune system, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=79.68s)]
*  meaning that we're constantly looking at [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=82.25999999999999s)]
*  all these digital toxins, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=83.6s)]
*  we scroll through our phones on social media, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  and then we suddenly start emulating the behavior [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=86.94s)]
*  that we see, you know, case in point, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  wear a mask, save lives. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=91.14s)]
*  Now people are suddenly masking their children [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=92.44s)]
*  and won't go outside. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=94.42s)]
*  Where an element of that is that you go on social media [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  and everybody's starting to look the same. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  It's like Avatar, it's very bizarre. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=100.08s)]
*  And I'm not against people that want to get Botox [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  and nip and tuck, I don't personally do it, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=104.3s)]
*  but I was curious if men found this new face [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=106.12s)]
*  that everyone has decided upon to be attractive, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=109.3s)]
*  and boy, was I met with so much heat from women. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=111.84s)]
*  I have a close friend of mine who gets Botox. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=115.12s)]
*  She said, Candace, you're launching a war on us white women. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=116.96s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=120.12s)]
*  This is what we have to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=121.16s)]
*  I realize that some topics, Tucker, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=122.86s)]
*  are in fact too sensitive, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=125.06s)]
*  and I would like to apologize [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=126.64s)]
*  to all of my fans and listeners. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=128.04s)]
*  And I will leave your Botox and your filler alone, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=130.0s)]
*  but we should investigate what is happening [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=132.74s)]
*  to Nancy's eyebrows. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=134.7s)]
*  Well, I agree with that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=136.28s)]
*  But everyone is starting to look the same [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=137.2s)]
*  and that's a really insightful observation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=139.28s)]
*  which never occurred to me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=142.48s)]
*  But men, I mean, I don't want to be judgy, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=143.32s)]
*  everyone does his own thing or whatever, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=145.0s)]
*  but it's a little bit, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=147.0s)]
*  there's something a little bit awful about that, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=148.55999999999997s)]
*  is there not? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=151.55999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what's awful about it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  The first thing is that men age like fine wine. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=154.48s)]
*  Men actually get better as they age, it's just a fact. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  A man at 20 is not gonna look as good as a man at 45. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  So it's really bizarre that they're trying to hold on [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  to their youth when women prefer older guy, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=163.72s)]
*  when they start to get gray hair and things of that nature, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=165.92s)]
*  and yet they too are being impacted [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  by this psychological immune system on Instagram [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=170.04s)]
*  and everybody's starting to look the same. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=172.4s)]
*  It's very hard to tell the difference between a trans man [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=174.76s)]
*  and a woman that's been getting a lot of work. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=177.76s)]
*  And this is just where we're at today [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  and I wanted to open the conversation and say, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=181.68s)]
*  hey, it's possible to just like your face [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=184.2s)]
*  and to age gracefully. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=186.92s)]
*  And I learned that people are not ready yet [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  to have that conversation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=191.12s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=192.84s)]
*  I never got any plastic surgery until I turned 65. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=193.72s)]
*  And then I was like, I have no choice. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=198.76s)]
*  Kanzo, it's great to see you tonight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=200.12s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3IBabPmvM&t=201.07999999999998s)]
