# Chicago Democrat tells Tucker Chicago O'Hare is overrun by the homeless
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g)
*  You may remember when illegal aliens took over the El Paso airport. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=0.0s)]
*  That seemed like a bad sign, but it could get worse. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=4.38s)]
*  It always can. Now the homeless, the so-called homeless, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=6.3s)]
*  have moved into Chicago International Airport, O'Hare. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=8.98s)]
*  Vigorous living in the terminals, sleeping by the baggage claims [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=13.18s)]
*  in one of the biggest and most famous airports in the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=16.84s)]
*  As one custodian at O'Hare put it, it's out of control. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=20.26s)]
*  None of us feel safe. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=23.3s)]
*  And you can say that for the city itself. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=24.88s)]
*  Raymond Lopez is an alderman in Chicago. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=26.8s)]
*  He has been a very rare voice in that city calling for sanity. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=29.02s)]
*  He's joining us tonight from O'Hare airport. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=32.44s)]
*  Alderman Lopez, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  What do you see there? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=37.78s)]
*  Tucker, no. Good evening, Tucker. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=39.82s)]
*  As we walk through the airport, the fourth largest airport in the United States, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=42.2s)]
*  we've seen this beautiful gateway to Chicago been overrun by the homeless, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=46.04s)]
*  where every night two to three hundred homeless individuals come off [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=50.34s)]
*  public transportation and set up encampments here and baggage claim [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=53.8s)]
*  and throughout all five terminals. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=57.52s)]
*  All the while, the mayor's voice is blasting from overhead, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  welcoming any one of the sixty five thousand daily visitors here [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=62.82s)]
*  in this indoor outhouse that we call O'Hare Airport. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=66.94s)]
*  How could the mayor of Chicago allow one of its most famous landmarks [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  and a transportation hub for the whole country to be desecrated [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=76.94s)]
*  by people urinating in it? I don't understand. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=80.44s)]
*  You know, they're not just urinating in the hallways, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=84.22s)]
*  they're taking baths in the toilets. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=86.56s)]
*  They're making a mockery of what Chicago is here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=88.36s)]
*  And we understand that homelessness is a problem we must address. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=91.78s)]
*  But making O'Hare Airport a homeless shelter for hundreds of people on a daily basis, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=94.94s)]
*  when we're trying to welcome people here, when we're trying to encourage tourism, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=100.44s)]
*  bring back the business clients, help bring back families to our city [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=103.72s)]
*  and to only have them greeted by hundreds of homeless who have mental health issues, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=107.18s)]
*  may be armed, maybe not even be clothed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=111.4s)]
*  That's not something that institutes a lot of confidence in our mayor, in our city. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  And clearly, she doesn't care because she's 17 miles away from it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  Surrounded by city finance bodyguards, unlike you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  There's an election coming up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=128.82s)]
*  She could win. How could that happen? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=130.78s)]
*  Right now, Tucker, we are 12 days away from the city's election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=135.36s)]
*  And as you know, we've been pushing hard to ensure that she does not have a path forward. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=138.72s)]
*  But it's amazing, amazing in a city like Chicago that we have so many individuals [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  who are hiding behind white guilt and privilege as an excuse to stick with the failed mayor [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  rather than hold her accountable for what she's done and what she continues to do to this beautiful city. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  They're willing to stick by her just to assuage their personal guilt of privilege [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  or whatever, wokeness, whatever they want to call it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=162.56s)]
*  And many of us continue to fight back. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=164.92s)]
*  I know you had Dr. Wilson on your show as well, who's standing up against her. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=167.02s)]
*  We have to fight back for this city because we can't allow what's happening here to become the mainstay [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=170.94s)]
*  for every neighborhood and for every iconic part of Chicago, which is overrun by the homeless, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=176.02s)]
*  overrun by gangs, overrun by criminality and what should be a welcoming city to all the good, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=181.42s)]
*  law-abiding people who want to make this home. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=186.5s)]
*  Well, that is about the most incisive description of modern politics I've heard in a long time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=189.14s)]
*  This is from Alderman Raymond Lopez of the city of Chicago. Thank you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=194.44s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S9-ybgS0g&t=198.48s)]
