# Tucker: This is why CNN's Stelter fired his nanny
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs)
*  So as we told you last night and you may have noticed CNN pulled its top-rated anchor Chris Cuomo off the air for the crime [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=0.0s)]
*  Of helping his brother, but you can't just pull someone off TV. I've let people know ahead of time [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=6.58s)]
*  Otherwise, you're gonna have about a dozen people tuning in and wondering wait, where's the steroid guy? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=11.24s)]
*  So over at CNN the dwarf King dispatched his eunuch with the news [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=15.8s)]
*  That Chris Cuomo was being pulled off [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=21.48s)]
*  indefinitely [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=23.96s)]
*  Suspended what's so interesting and tells you so very much about CNN is we learned today that the eunuch himself would like Chris [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Cuomo's job. Ooh the betrayal mr. Barrier [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  So interesting so it raises the question. What kind of person is [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=35.92s)]
*  CNN's media critic we've come across audio that answers that question [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=40.56s)]
*  So here is and we're gonna use his name for the first time Brian Stelter [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=46.56s)]
*  Explaining to a group of people that he has fired his nanny who of course remains nameless [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=51.0s)]
*  Because she refused to get the injection listen to this [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=56.0s)]
*  You know that me and my wife both work full-time. We both make enough money to have a nanny during the day in New York and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=59.84s)]
*  and our nanny refuses to get vaccinated and so we are parting ways with her and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=66.64s)]
*  It was very very sad that we thought we thought after six months of seeing the vaccines are all good [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=71.56s)]
*  And everybody's fine that she would come around [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=77.84s)]
*  So the headline here is that CNN's media critic dismissed blithely [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=81.0s)]
*  Dismissed his little non-white servant because she didn't obey and that is what very very sad [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=86.2s)]
*  Well, how sad how sad was he exactly? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=91.68s)]
*  Did he pay her health insurance until she finds a new job? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=94.68s)]
*  What is she doing to eat and pay her rent now that she's been? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=98.36s)]
*  Dismissed by CNN's very sad media critic. We really care what happens to our servants [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=102.12s)]
*  Do we when they disobey so we asked CNN today, of course, we got no answer at all, which is itself an answer [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=107.36s)]
*  Which is we don't know we don't care [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=113.36s)]
*  Tells you a lot [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPqnQxeNzs&t=116.68s)]
