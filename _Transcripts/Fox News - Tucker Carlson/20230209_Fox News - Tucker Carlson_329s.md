# Tucker: We were attacked for asking questions about this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q)
*  So, before the war in Ukraine even began, both Toria Nuland at the State Department, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  the number two at the State Department, and Joe Biden threatened to blow up the Nord Stream [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=5.0s)]
*  pipeline. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=8.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=9.88s)]
*  I want to be clear with you today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=10.88s)]
*  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=14.16s)]
*  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=22.1s)]
*  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=30.1s)]
*  We will bring an end to it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=36.1s)]
*  But how will you do that exactly, since the project and control of the project is within [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=40.1s)]
*  Germany's control? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=48.1s)]
*  We will, I promise you, we will be able to do it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=50.1s)]
*  So, then the pipelines actually blew up, at least the pipelines that bring natural gas [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=54.1s)]
*  from Eastern Europe to Western Europe to keep the European economy going. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=59.1s)]
*  And they exploded, causing the single largest human-caused environmental disaster in all [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=62.1s)]
*  of history, and again, setting Europe on the road to actual poverty. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=68.1s)]
*  So, it was an unpopular event, and Joe Biden denied any responsibility. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=73.1s)]
*  In fact, he blamed Russia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=78.1s)]
*  Joe Biden and his whole administration told us that somehow Russia, for reasons they never [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=79.8s)]
*  made clear, just because they're evil, had sabotaged their own energy pipeline. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=84.8s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=89.8s)]
*  It was a deliberate act of sabotage, and now the Russians are pumping out disinformation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=91.8s)]
*  and lies. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=98.8s)]
*  So, that was in September, and it was obvious from the very first day, well, that's not [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=99.8s)]
*  true. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=103.8s)]
*  It's not that Vladimir Putin is too good a person to blow up Nord Stream, but like, why [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=104.8s)]
*  does he do that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=108.8s)]
*  It only hurts him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=109.8s)]
*  And by the way, it really hurts Western Europe. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=110.8s)]
*  But a lot of media outlets repeated that lie dutifully. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=113.8s)]
*  That's what they do, and attacked us as Putin's stooges for having questions about it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=115.8s)]
*  Well, we know a lot more now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=120.8s)]
*  There have been a number of official investigations of what happened, and not one has found any [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=122.8s)]
*  evidence of Russian involvement. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=126.8s)]
*  And now we have the actual answer to what happened. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=128.8s)]
*  Oh, the Biden administration did it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=130.8s)]
*  For real. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=131.8s)]
*  Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, who's been around for more than 50 years, just wrote [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=133.8s)]
*  a piece on Substack that includes this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=136.8s)]
*  Quote, last June, the Navy divers, U.S. Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=138.8s)]
*  publicized midsummer NATO exercise known as Ball Tops 22, planted remotely triggered [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=143.8s)]
*  explosives that three months later destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=149.8s)]
*  according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=153.8s)]
*  Now, this piece continues. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=157.8s)]
*  It's probably the most comprehensive news story you will read this year. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=158.8s)]
*  Seymour Hersh on Substack, you should read it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=162.8s)]
*  And it recounts in detail meetings with the national security adviser at the White House, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=165.8s)]
*  where this was planned, exactly what explosives were used, how they were triggered by what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=170.8s)]
*  aircraft on what day. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=174.8s)]
*  So many details in here that it is not possible that it's not true. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=176.8s)]
*  It is true. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=180.8s)]
*  And in fact, no one in the high level of the U.S. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=182.8s)]
*  government is denying it with any specificity and said the White House is just dismissing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=184.8s)]
*  this utterly false. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=187.8s)]
*  And no reporters are following up on this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=188.8s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=190.8s)]
*  Aaron Mat√© is following up on it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=191.8s)]
*  He's with the Gray Zone. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=193.8s)]
*  Aaron, I don't remember the last time I saw a story this well reported. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=194.8s)]
*  It wasn't in the New York Times, Hersh's former employer. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=199.8s)]
*  They wouldn't have run it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=202.8s)]
*  But the fact that nobody at the White House briefing today even asked about this story [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=203.8s)]
*  makes me think we are becoming North Korea. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=207.8s)]
*  Tucker, this is a case where you have the motive. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=212.8s)]
*  The U.S. has long been trying to stop the Nord Stream 2 because as Sy Hersh's story points out, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=214.8s)]
*  the U.S. has recognized that if Nord Stream 2 goes online, that will make it a lot more [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=221.8s)]
*  difficult for the U.S. to wage a proxy war against Russia because Germany will not want [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=226.8s)]
*  to be on board with cutting off its source of cheap energy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=230.8s)]
*  So the U.S. found an answer to that problem. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=234.8s)]
*  They blew it up. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=237.8s)]
*  And it's interesting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=238.8s)]
*  Hersh reports that the planning for this operation began in late 2021. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=239.8s)]
*  And that's when Russian forces were massing on the border of Ukraine and there was a threat [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=243.8s)]
*  of the invasion. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=247.8s)]
*  But something else happened. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=248.8s)]
*  Russia in that same month of December 2021, when planning was underway at the White House [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=249.8s)]
*  to blow up Nord Stream 2, Russia also submitted draft treaties to the U.S. and NATO, laying [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=254.8s)]
*  out detailed proposals for the U.S. and NATO to resolve their issues, to roll back NATO [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=259.8s)]
*  military infrastructure in states surrounding Russia. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=264.8s)]
*  Now, we know what happened to that because the U.S. rejected it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=267.8s)]
*  It wouldn't even discuss the core issue of Ukraine not joining NATO. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=269.8s)]
*  Instead, the U.S. chose to basically let the Russian invasion happen. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=274.8s)]
*  And then when that happened, proceeded to engage in this operation to blow up Nord Stream 2. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=277.8s)]
*  And they made no secret about their embrace of this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=282.8s)]
*  The day after the Nord Stream 2 was sabotaged, Antony Blinken declared that this was a tremendous [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=285.8s)]
*  strategic opportunity. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=291.8s)]
*  And most recently, you've covered this, Victoria Nuland testified in Congress that she is grateful, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=293.8s)]
*  along with the White House, that the Nord Stream 2 is now a hulk of metal at the bottom of the sea. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=298.8s)]
*  I mean, NATO is a coalition of European powers led by the United States. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=304.8s)]
*  The United States just wrecked their economies. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=308.8s)]
*  I don't see how NATO stays together after this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=311.8s)]
*  I don't, but I mean, what do I know? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=313.8s)]
*  Aramate, I hope you'll come back. Thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqcwRTuf1Q&t=315.8s)]
