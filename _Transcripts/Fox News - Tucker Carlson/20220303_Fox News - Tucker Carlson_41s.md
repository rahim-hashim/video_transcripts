# Tucker: What was Nancy Pelosi thinking? #shorts
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA)
*  What was this about, do you think? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=0.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  I'm booked to answer what that's about. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=5.68s)]
*  That is the creepiest thing that you can possibly imagine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=8.88s)]
*  Burn pits. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=14.08s)]
*  You know she's doing the same thing Schumer's doing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=15.92s)]
*  Oh, this is a good time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=20.8s)]
*  Is it the time? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=21.84s)]
*  I can't remember if this says applause in the script. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=22.48s)]
*  I think it's the time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=24.72s)]
*  I'm going to jump up. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=25.64s)]
*  And then maybe right when she jumps up to, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=26.8s)]
*  she hears burn pits. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=29.88s)]
*  And what do I do at this point? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=30.84s)]
*  I clinch my fist and rub them together [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=32.96s)]
*  in a creepy mannequin-esque way. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=35.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=37.32s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  And I think I'm being charitable. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9k5epcgDKA&t=39.12s)]
