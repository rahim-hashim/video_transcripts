# Texas Mayor blasts Biden’s inaction at the border a ‘clown show’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano)
*  Thousands of migrants remain in Del Rio, Texas at this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=0.0s)]
*  Many of the Haitians have now left the encampment you're seeing on your screen. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=3.6s)]
*  The White House conceded today that it has no idea where they are, where they went. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=7.44s)]
*  Let's just pause and note that this is not a disaster. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=13.52s)]
*  It's not a crisis. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=18.0s)]
*  This is criminal behavior. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=19.92s)]
*  This is the executive branch of government intentionally subverting federal law, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=22.72s)]
*  encouraging the breaking of American law, abetting crimes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=27.68s)]
*  This is criminal behavior. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  The White House is doing nothing about it because they caused it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=35.2s)]
*  They did just announce the border patrol is now prohibited from using horses at the border [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=37.6s)]
*  because the real crime is against the people trying to break into our country, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  not against the country itself. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=45.84s)]
*  Notice all of our time has been spent concerned about the people trying to break our laws [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=47.2s)]
*  and none of the time in the national media or even in our national political circles, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=51.36s)]
*  national political conversations in either party has been devoted to the Americans who [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=56.88s)]
*  are suffering because of this, which is all 340 million of us, but it's particularly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=61.92s)]
*  the Americans who live in South Texas, towns like Uvalde. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=66.48s)]
*  Don McLaughlin is the mayor of Uvalde, Texas. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=70.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight for an update on how things are going. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=75.36s)]
*  How are things going? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=77.12s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=79.44s)]
*  It's pretty much a clown show. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=81.92s)]
*  I mean, the border is wide open. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=83.52s)]
*  All the checkpoints are closed from West Texas all the way to below Del Rio. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=87.28s)]
*  The foot traffic has increased tenfold. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=91.84s)]
*  The human smuggling has increased tenfold. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=94.56s)]
*  There's no border patrol agents available. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=97.6s)]
*  They're all down at Del Rio processing Haitians. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=99.6s)]
*  It's just getting crazier and crazier and crazier. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=106.08s)]
*  And these peaceful immigrants, illegal immigrants, they keep talking about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=109.28s)]
*  are getting more and more aggressive with landowners. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=114.64s)]
*  They're doing more destruction of property. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=117.92s)]
*  They're tearing things up, trashing ranch houses, trashing vehicles. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=119.76s)]
*  And you can complain all you want, but this administration turns a blind eye to it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  This is such a failed administration and a failed president. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=131.44s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=134.56s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=136.0s)]
*  Well, it's criminal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=136.96s)]
*  They're abetting crimes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=137.68s)]
*  Will you or anybody else in your community or in that region expect to get reimbursed [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=140.08s)]
*  by the federal government for the damage caused by these new Democratic voters [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=144.88s)]
*  that they're letting in? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=148.32s)]
*  Well, I sent, you mentioned, I sent today pictures on a piece of property that we have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=150.56s)]
*  where they trashed the property, cut the fences in two times, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=156.48s)]
*  have pictures of them walking across the property and that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=160.64s)]
*  And I sent that out to all my federally elected officials today since immigration [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=163.28s)]
*  the government's baby. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=169.44s)]
*  Who do I send the bill to for making these repairs? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=171.6s)]
*  I haven't got a response yet. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=174.48s)]
*  Yeah, I suspect you won't. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=176.48s)]
*  Nor is any other rancher down there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=177.92s)]
*  The rest of the country really, I mean, I think we're all going to be affected by this, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  but you're affected by it first and most profoundly. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=183.76s)]
*  And I don't just our hearts go out to you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=186.0s)]
*  Mayor Don McLaughlin of Uvalde, Texas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=187.84s)]
*  Thanks for coming on tonight. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=189.44s)]
*  Yes, sir. Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34j2kHPano&t=191.44s)]
