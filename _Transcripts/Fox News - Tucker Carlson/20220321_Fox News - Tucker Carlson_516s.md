# Kid Rock tells Tucker what it's like to golf with Donald Trump
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw)
*  So a lot of entertainers are very quiet about their political views. Bob Richie, Kid Rock is not. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=0.0s)]
*  But what's interesting, according to him, his views are not uncommon in the entertainment industry. They're just suppressed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=7.44s)]
*  We asked him, by the way, since he's a frequent golf partner of former President Trump, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=14.44s)]
*  how'd you first meet him and what do you think of him? And above all, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=18.64s)]
*  what do you think of Tony Fauci? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=21.92s)]
*  Here's more of our extended interview with Kid Rock. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Where'd you meet Trump? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=30.0s)]
*  Meet Trump? Oh, at the White House. Sarah Palin. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=36.0s)]
*  Oh, at the White House. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=39.88s)]
*  Sarah Palin asked him to, I was friendly with her, and early, right when he got elected, he invited her to dinner and said, bring some interesting people. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=41.0s)]
*  So she said she called me and Ted, Ted Nugent, and was like, hell yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=49.2s)]
*  Ended up there. We ended up becoming buddies and spent a lot of time in the golf course now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  And really weird to get phone calls from and stuff is just kind of mind blowing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=59.04s)]
*  What's he like to play golf with? Awesome. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=63.28s)]
*  So much fun. Really? Why? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=66.52s)]
*  He just knows how to have fun. Doesn't take it too seriously. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=69.68s)]
*  Yeah. You know, he's engaging. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=73.08s)]
*  It's just you're just cutting it up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=75.92s)]
*  Just open with politics. Matt was there with him one day when he ended the caliphate. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=77.72s)]
*  He wanted to put out a tweet and it was like, I don't like to speak out of school. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=82.44s)]
*  I hope I'm not. But that's something like he's like, tell him like, yeah, the tweet was and I'm paraphrasing, but it's like, you know, if you ever joined the caliphate, you know, and try to do this, you're going to be dead. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=86.68s)]
*  He goes, what do you think? I go, awesome. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=96.68s)]
*  Yeah. Tweet that out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=100.12s)]
*  I can't add anything better than that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=102.24s)]
*  But then it comes out and it's very it's reworded and more political and like, you know, a little politically correct. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=103.56s)]
*  And I'm like, just be a pro. You know, we're looking at maps. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=109.08s)]
*  I'm like, you know, I'm like, am I supposed to be like in on? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=112.32s)]
*  I make dirty records sometimes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=116.64s)]
*  I do it here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=119.72s)]
*  You didn't think you'd have a hand. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=120.72s)]
*  What do you think we should do about North Korea? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=121.92s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=123.6s)]
*  I don't think I'm qualified to answer this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=127.2s)]
*  How does he see you? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=132.48s)]
*  You're still playing golf with him down in Florida. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=133.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=135.36s)]
*  How's he seen? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=136.36s)]
*  What's that? How's he seen? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=137.36s)]
*  He seems great. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=139.44s)]
*  He seems great. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=140.68s)]
*  You know, after the election, it was, you know, a little, you know, a little different there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=141.68s)]
*  But he's still the same guy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=145.12s)]
*  He sits down. He just cuts it up. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=147.72s)]
*  Just starts cutting it up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=149.72s)]
*  It's just how sharp he is is incredible. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=150.72s)]
*  And you can see now if you watch a Joe Biden interview and you watch a Trump interview, you're just like, there's there's no comparison. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=153.0s)]
*  And Trump, yeah, he speaks off the cuff. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  I understand what it's like. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  Sometimes you get it wrong. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, this, that and the other. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  But I would way rather hear somebody come from here and get it wrong once in a while than see this contrived pretty much every politician until he came out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  At some level, everything was scripted. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=172.92s)]
*  I mean, I stood next to him in the White House and right next to him with the prepared notes and watch him read like one sentence, then just let's go. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=173.92s)]
*  You're like, this is awesome. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=180.92s)]
*  Kid Rock. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=181.92s)]
*  Kid. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=182.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=183.92s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=184.92s)]
*  Do you like this legislation or do you hate it? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=185.92s)]
*  I like it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=186.92s)]
*  You've been fighting for a long time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=187.92s)]
*  That's why I liked him from the beginning. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=188.92s)]
*  You know, I said, you know, he was my guy before he even got the nomination. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=189.92s)]
*  And Rolling Stone. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=190.92s)]
*  And since that day, he's been fighting for a long time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=191.92s)]
*  And he's been fighting for a long time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=192.92s)]
*  And he's been fighting for a long time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=193.92s)]
*  And he's been fighting for a long time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=194.92s)]
*  And he's been fighting for a long time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=195.92s)]
*  And he's been fighting for a long time. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=196.92s)]
*  I mean, if you had a manager who is in control of your career, he would say, you know, maybe let's not weigh in on this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=203.92s)]
*  I mean, if you had a manager who is in control of your career, he would say, you know, maybe let's not weigh in on this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=204.92s)]
*  Oh, I've had managers that, you know, well, manager punch, you know, I love dearly. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=205.92s)]
*  Oh, I've had managers that, you know, well, manager punch, you know, I love dearly. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=206.92s)]
*  He told me flat out when he started to manage it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=207.92s)]
*  He goes, just so you know, he goes, everything you've done to this point in your career to get where you're at, I would have told you no. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=208.92s)]
*  He told me flat out when he started to manage it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=209.92s)]
*  He goes, just so you know, he goes, everything you've done to this point in your career to get where you're at, I would have told you no. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=210.92s)]
*  I've just gone by my heart and the seat of my pants, tried to be a good person, you know, be educated if I'm going to speak on some things. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=232.92s)]
*  I've just gone by my heart and the seat of my pants, tried to be a good person, you know, be educated if I'm going to speak on some things. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=233.92s)]
*  I've just gone by my heart and the seat of my pants, tried to be a good person, you know, be educated if I'm going to speak on some things. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=234.92s)]
*  I've just gone by my heart and the seat of my pants, tried to be a good person, you know, be educated if I'm going to speak on some things. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=235.92s)]
*  I've just gone by my heart and the seat of my pants, tried to be a good person, you know, be educated if I'm going to speak on some things. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=236.92s)]
*  Sometimes not so much, but whatever, just kind of call it legacy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=238.92s)]
*  We had dinner last night and you rolled up in a Rolls Royce, the Let's Go, Brandon edition? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=243.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=249.92s)]
*  With a Waffle House plate. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=250.92s)]
*  With a Waffle House plate. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=252.92s)]
*  So for our viewers who might want the Rolls Royce, Let's Go, Brandon edition, like where can you get one? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=254.92s)]
*  You go on this thing called Google and you type in, you know, car badges, Let's Go, Brandon. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  And there's companies that come up on my truck. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=265.92s)]
*  I got one that says White Boy Edition. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=267.92s)]
*  There's all these crazy things, but it looks official. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=269.92s)]
*  So, you know, I would never drive a foreign car and be driven. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=271.92s)]
*  I used to like say to myself, like I'm so proud, you know, for how hard I work and, you know, what I charge people for shows is what I think is fair because I can hold my head high because I feel I've never made an honest dollar off a working man's back. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=274.92s)]
*  And so I get Rolls Royce. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=287.92s)]
*  I'm in Nashville, so I'm not in Detroit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=289.92s)]
*  So it's the same, but it came for sale, this thing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=291.92s)]
*  And I had this Waffle House license plate holder forever. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=294.92s)]
*  And I'm like, I need a car to put that thing on. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=297.92s)]
*  I need to get that Rolls Royce. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=301.92s)]
*  And then the Let's Go, Brandon badge came out. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=303.92s)]
*  I'm like, oh, there is a heaven. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=305.92s)]
*  I'm like, this is just too good. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=307.92s)]
*  This is too much fun. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=310.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=311.92s)]
*  Without naming their names, are there, and you would know, are there other people in your business who agree with you privately? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=312.92s)]
*  Yeah. And it was funny during the last election when Trump's thing is that some people on his inside say it to me. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=318.92s)]
*  They were naming off Hollywood people. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=325.92s)]
*  And they kept going like, you know, they have her in the closet. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=327.92s)]
*  I'm like, those people are all gay. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=330.92s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=332.92s)]
*  And they're like, no, no, no, they're closet Trump fans. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=333.92s)]
*  I'm like, oh, man. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=336.92s)]
*  I was like, that was kind of mind blowing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=340.92s)]
*  You know, like, I'm not going to talk out of school on these people. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=342.92s)]
*  They obviously don't want to be out in the open for whatever reasons they have. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=344.92s)]
*  But yeah, there's a ton of them. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=349.92s)]
*  They have no idea. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=351.92s)]
*  Me and Trump talk about that a lot. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=352.92s)]
*  We're like, you know, they have no idea how many of us there are. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=354.92s)]
*  You know, the vocal ones, sure, you know, they already see them, but they have no idea how many of us there are out there that not are either Trump fans or just, you know, more conservative. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=357.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=366.92s)]
*  And conservative to me, I don't know to you has changed. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=367.92s)]
*  When I was young, conservative was like, you know, sweaters and collared shirt. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=369.92s)]
*  Oh, I haven't updated my look since the 80s. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=373.92s)]
*  OK, I'm not I'm not quick. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=378.92s)]
*  But you know, it was like if I said the F word when I was young, I was running out of the house, you know, because I was about to get paddled. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=380.92s)]
*  Yeah. Or something like this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=385.92s)]
*  And, you know, nowadays it's like conservatives are a little hipper, you know, it's, you know, a little more out in the open. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=386.92s)]
*  Well, they're the people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=391.92s)]
*  And I'm sure that'll be the headline from our, you know, from the left wing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=392.92s)]
*  I can already see their headlines on this interview. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=395.92s)]
*  It's like Tucker and Kid Rock's love story together. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=397.92s)]
*  I'm not embarrassed. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=400.92s)]
*  I'm a fan. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=402.92s)]
*  No, I mean, look, I respect anyone who thinks for himself, even if that person reaches different conclusions from me. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=403.92s)]
*  What I don't respect is people who just sign up for the program because someone in power told him to think it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=409.92s)]
*  I don't respect that. Why would you? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=414.92s)]
*  We can we can agree on certain levels to think each other, each one another is a dumbass. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=415.92s)]
*  Right. That's totally fine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=420.92s)]

*  Fauci. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=426.92s)]
*  You speak for many when you say that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=428.92s)]
*  Did you believe him at the beginning, Fauci? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=430.92s)]
*  I believed all the bullshits beginning. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=433.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we were kind of shooting this documentary and I'm like so embarrassed. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=435.92s)]
*  I'm like in here like everyone spraying off UPS packages and like spraying on the doorknobs. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=438.92s)]
*  And like a couple months of that like what? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=442.92s)]
*  It's like so this pretty much like is knocking out overweight on healthy people. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=446.92s)]
*  I'm like, I'm good. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=451.92s)]
*  And so most of my friends after people start getting it, you're like, you know, some people had a little worse notice, but it was nothing, you know, you know, and I don't want to, you know, you know, throw any shine on people that had a bad time or passed away with it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=453.92s)]
*  It's horrible when anyone's lost. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=466.92s)]
*  But to me, I was like, this is some bullshits and all this mass, you know, one day it's just the disinformation that's in the world now. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=470.92s)]

*  No what to believe. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=479.92s)]
*  So there's a man who talks and lives like you might talk or live if you were totally insulated from big companies and could afford it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=483.92s)]
*  So it was a fascinating experience spending a couple of days with Kid Rock on his property in Tennessee. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=491.92s)]
*  All free documentary making for the Tucker Cross original series coming out this summer. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_dQ5lfyXLw&t=498.92s)]
