# MLB legend Keith Hernandez reveals how he played through hangovers and more
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg)
*  So we sat down with one of the greatest figures in American sports, Keith Hernandez, formerly of the Cardinals and the Mets, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=0.0s)]
*  had an amazing career as a first baseman, won two World Series titles, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=8.24s)]
*  but [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=12.72s)]
*  he was really the kind of athlete that you don't see today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=14.0s)]
*  Here's a man who smoked cigarettes in the dugout, played some of his games hung over, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=17.6s)]
*  and we asked him, because we couldn't resist, how did you do that? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=21.2s)]
*  How did you play at that high a level while living the life you were? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Here's part of the conversation from Tucker Carlson today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=27.52s)]
*  Read these stories about baseball players tearing it up at night and then playing the next day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=32.32s)]
*  How do people play at a high level with a hangover? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=36.64s)]
*  You can't do it, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  make a habit of it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=42.8s)]
*  Yeah, but you can't. It'll catch up to you. Chicago was the place. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=44.24s)]
*  Wrigley Field. One of the great things about Wrigley Field [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=48.3s)]
*  was that it's the same ballpark that when Ruth made the point, the home run. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=52.08s)]
*  You're in that clubhouse. It was this tiny clubhouse, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=58.24s)]
*  tiny, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=61.84s)]
*  and you had to walk up the stairs and over the people. You could see the people and they'd throw beers at you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  It was just fun. It was great fun. I loved Wrigley. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=68.32s)]
*  But when you sat in your locker, you go, gosh darn, Babe Ruth, Luke Garrick sat here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=70.88s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Stan Musial, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=76.0s)]
*  in all the greats and here I am in the same locker as them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=78.64s)]
*  But [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=83.84s)]
*  getting back to your point, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=84.72s)]
*  Russian division, you can go to a bar in Russian division at 11 o'clock and it's empty. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=86.72s)]
*  You go at one o'clock, it's packed and it would go to four. Now if you stayed out to four, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=91.76s)]
*  don't go to bed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=98.0s)]
*  Don't try to sleep. Just stay up. I did it three times in my career. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=99.92s)]
*  Just because I had to do it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=104.4s)]
*  and I got out the first base and I said, Lord, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=107.36s)]
*  please no ground balls today. No, no tuck plays. I promise I'll never do it again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  How'd you play? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=119.04s)]
*  I don't remember. I did good when I was tired or if I had, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=120.48s)]
*  I focused more if, say, I had a headache or for whatever reason, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  I focused more. You can't let your team down. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=131.76s)]
*  It's a team game. I can't, I can't in my right mind go out in the field [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=134.16s)]
*  because I'm tired or I've had too many hung over and I'm holding the runner on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=139.52s)]
*  and I got to come off the bag with the pitch and if I slough it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=145.44s)]
*  and don't do that extra step and the ball gets by me in the outfield and it's first and third, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=152.0s)]
*  I let that, my team down that pitcher, I couldn't do it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=155.76s)]
*  So I bore down more when I was sick or if I had a few too many beers. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=158.64s)]
*  And you never missed a game from being hung over? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=168.88s)]
*  Oh, God, no. Heck no. No way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=172.32s)]
*  That's pretty impressive. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=177.04s)]
*  No, it's not. No. You can't let your teammates down. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=178.88s)]
*  But we could sleep till noon. I slept till noon. My schedule, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=183.76s)]
*  even if I'd just say it's a night game and say I, the normal would have been hotel bar [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  till one o'clock, 1.30, I'd go to my room, go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up till 12 noon. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  That was my schedule, night games. I would call room service, coffee, Danish, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  and I'd turn on ABC and watch all my children. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=205.12s)]
*  You watched all my children on the road? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=210.16s)]
*  Yes. Religiously. My whole career. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=212.0s)]
*  No way. Yes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=216.08s)]
*  You're watching soap operas in your hotel room? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=217.84s)]
*  Just that one. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=220.4s)]
*  Watching soap operas on the road, you learn something every time. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=225.28s)]
*  Baseball legend Keith Hernandez now on Fox Nation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b27vgAbrYKg&t=228.4s)]
