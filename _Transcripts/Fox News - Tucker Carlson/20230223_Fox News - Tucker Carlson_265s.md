# Tucker Carlson: You should be outraged by this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ)
*  Whatever you think of Donald Trump, when he's unleashed in a crowd of people, he's pretty [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  unbelievable. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  If you haven't seen the tape of him ordering at McDonald's in East Palestine, treat yourself. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  He wows everyone in the room. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=10.4s)]
*  Again, you don't have to love Trump to know he's really good at this, and it's real. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I mean, he feels it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=16.04s)]
*  That's why he's so good at it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=17.04s)]
*  So he's a huge threat. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=18.22s)]
*  But in a normal country in a democracy, you would let voters decide whether they want [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=19.8s)]
*  him to run the country again. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=22.88s)]
*  But no, partisan prosecutors at all levels, state and federal, are trying to prevent him [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=24.38s)]
*  from running for president again. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=29.24s)]
*  Everyone knows this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=30.88s)]
*  No one ever says it, but it's true. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=31.88s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=32.88s)]
*  In Fulton County, Georgia, for example, prosecutors have a grand jury going, and they've put [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  a self-described witch on it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=39.04s)]
*  This is the grand jury investigating Trump for election interference, in other words, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=41.4s)]
*  for complaining about what was clearly an unfair election. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=44.8s)]
*  Now, this person is called Emily Kors. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=47.44s)]
*  She is the for-person of the jury, and she posts online about different spells she can [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=49.78s)]
*  cast. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=55.92s)]
*  CNN just interviewed her. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=56.92s)]
*  How'd it go? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=58.16s)]
*  What do you assess? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=60.12s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=61.12s)]
*  It's not a short list. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=62.12s)]
*  Not a short list. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=63.12s)]
*  More, I mean, when it comes to 75 witnesses, like, it's not, I assume, of course, it's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=64.11999999999999s)]
*  not 75 people. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=70.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=71.16s)]
*  Would you characterize it as 20-ish people? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=72.16s)]
*  I can't say I counted. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  More than a dozen, though, I think I'd heard you say in another interview. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=82.72s)]
*  I'd be interested to know. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=83.72s)]
*  I'm sure we'll hear more from him after it all comes out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=85.28s)]
*  I will be happy as long as something happens. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=89.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=93.28s)]
*  Just a jury of your peers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=96.28s)]
*  Guaranteed by the Constitution. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Charlie Hurt is the opinion editor of The Washington Times. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=100.12s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=102.68s)]
*  I mean, I didn't even know this was allowed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=103.68s)]
*  I didn't know the for-person, whatever that is, is allowed to do scene interviews while [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=106.36s)]
*  the grand jury's still on panel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=110.28s)]
*  Or doesn't this... [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=111.68s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=112.68s)]
*  I'll stop. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=113.68s)]
*  And she was picked by the other jurors to be the for-person. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=115.64s)]
*  So I'd hate to see the rest of the juries. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=120.72000000000001s)]
*  This woman, she's a lunatic, obviously, as you point out. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=124.4s)]
*  But she's... [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=128.36s)]
*  This is kind of what you get with America on TikTok. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=129.78s)]
*  This is, to her, this is all a big social media thing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that she's... [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=137.28s)]
*  Not to mention, of course, these things. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  Grand juries are supposed to be done in secret. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=141.4s)]
*  She's obviously blown through all of that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=143.52s)]
*  But it does sort of raise all kinds of questions. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=146.0s)]
*  Well, gee, what else is going on in secret if this is the sort of thing that you wind [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  up with? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  But if nothing else, she's a poster child for why we should only allow people who have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  jobs and pay taxes sit on juries. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=159.8s)]
*  And she's also a poster child for avoiding online dating. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=163.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, that is absolutely true. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=166.44000000000003s)]
*  And I'm not going to take the bait on that, Charlie. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  Let me just affirm my agreement with it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=171.24s)]
*  But really quick, big picture what's going on here is Democrats are using the legal system [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=173.68s)]
*  to stop a presidential candidate from running for president. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=179.24s)]
*  Now, you don't have to love Trump. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  If you believe in our system and wanted to continue, you should be outraged, hair on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  fire, angry about this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=190.28s)]
*  But no one's saying anything, so far as I can tell. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=191.52s)]
*  Well, that's the real serious side of all of this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=194.24s)]
*  She's ridiculous and it's easy to make fun of her. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=197.08s)]
*  But if you think about this, think if this was an actual serious case and think if you [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=199.56s)]
*  had actual serious adult prosecutors prosecuting a serious case and you were the person that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=205.56s)]
*  was facing your life in jail. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=211.72s)]
*  And you looked up into the jury box and you saw this lunatic sitting in the jury box. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=214.96s)]
*  These people make a mockery of everything we stand for. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=220.44s)]
*  And I would argue in a lot of ways, even more important than voting in this country is the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=222.94s)]
*  concept of a jury of your peers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=228.64s)]
*  You can't be railroaded by a bunch of people who don't, who aren't like you, who don't [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=230.96s)]
*  come from your society. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=235.56s)]
*  And the idea that you would have a grand jury with people like this on it makes a mockery [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=238.24s)]
*  of all of that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=243.34s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that could be you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  That is absolutely right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=248.06s)]
*  And I hope people think about that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=249.06s)]
*  Even people who don't like Trump think about that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=250.1s)]
*  We're breaking too much. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=252.12s)]
*  Charlie Hurd, thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=253.12s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_TLIDjmLMQ&t=254.12s)]
