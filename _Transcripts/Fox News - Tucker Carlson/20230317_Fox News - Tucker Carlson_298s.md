# Tanzanian fashion designer speaks out after Sam Brinton allegedly stole her luggage
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U)
*  It's only March. We're going to go ahead and just declare this the best story of the year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=0.0s)]
*  So we told you about a Tanzanian fashion designer who was watching Fox News coverage of Sam Brinton. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=3.6s)]
*  That would be Joe Biden's non-binary cross-dressing nuclear waste expert who stole luggage off [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  carousels as part of his fetish. So this designer, Asiya Alkag, noticed that Sam Brinton was wearing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=16.0s)]
*  one of her dresses. And we thought, how great would it be to track down this Tanzanian designer to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=22.16s)]
*  tell her story? And we have. She joins us now with her husband, Kamsin. Asiya, thank you so much. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=27.92s)]
*  Kamsin, thank you. Asiya, will you tell us what happened? How did you notice that it was your dress? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=33.6s)]
*  Hi, Bismillah. Thanks for inviting me to your show. My name is Asiya Idarus Kamsin, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=41.84s)]
*  Tanzanian fashion designer based in Houston, Texas. On February 2018, I flew back from Tanzania [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=49.92s)]
*  with my collection of Lady Red Fashion Show 2018, which is my annual platform. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  I was invited in Washington, D.C. to Kenyan community event who really support my work to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  showcase my designs. I flew from Houston to Washington, D.C. on March 9th, 2018 when I arrived [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=72.96s)]
*  in D.C.A. One of my bags was missing. I opened the claim to Delta office in D.C.A. and I made a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  police report in D.C.A. airport, but my bag was not found. On December 2022, we saw on the Fox News [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  about Sam Brinton's luggage issue and saw my custom-made designs worn by Sam Brinton, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=100.32s)]
*  which was in the missing bag back in 2018. Oh my God, I was shocked. For more than 40 years, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  I worked hard. On my work, it's very paining. Then I made another police report in Houston. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  They told me to wait for investigation. On January, somebody called me and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=124.72s)]
*  introduced himself and he told me he's working on my issue, but still today I had nothing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=131.68s)]
*  I was asking myself how this person got my custom-made designs because it's one of a kind [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=138.4s)]
*  and wear them without fear and display in public. I don't accuse him as a thief, but there is [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=145.76s)]
*  question to be answered here. What I can say for now with all pains, time, suffer, let down my people, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=152.72s)]
*  didn't attend the show, what I need is justice now and I believe there is justice. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=161.84s)]
*  Well, I believe that too. Has he reached out to you, the man who clearly stole your luggage, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=169.28s)]
*  Sam Brinton? Has he called you or returned these dresses? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=174.16s)]
*  No. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=176.8s)]
*  May I ask a question of your husband? Here you have this entitled little creep who's a federal [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  official stealing your wife's clothing. What's your reaction to that and what would you say [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=186.96s)]
*  to Sam Brinton if you could? Well, the only thing I can say is paining and I was going through [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=192.08s)]
*  hardship to try to calm her down because this is her passion. She had been doing this for 40 years [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=202.32s)]
*  and all of a sudden somebody running around with your design and piece of art, it's painful. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=211.12s)]
*  She asked me, like I said, whatever you've been trying, if there is justice, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=219.28s)]
*  let them hate about you. If somebody can step up and try to help because without help, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=226.88s)]
*  and these things, people think it turns more into political, which it's not. You can't say green is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=235.6s)]
*  black or black is yellow. Black is black. The truth wants to be said. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=242.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=250.32s)]
*  Yes. So we thank you to come to your show and maybe somebody outside can hear her claim. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=250.88000000000002s)]
*  And I hope this man gets a little Tanzanian justice, honestly, because he's not getting [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=265.44s)]
*  in this country. So I appreciate so much both of you coming on and I'm sorry for what you've [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=269.76s)]
*  been through and I hope that restitution is paid to you both. Thank you very much. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=279.12s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=280.88s)]
*  But we're calling for somebody there too, if you can help out. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=282.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0ZuJf7q_U&t=286.4s)]
