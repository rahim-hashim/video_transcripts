# African reporter fires back at White House press secretary
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4)
*  So if you've ever watched a White House press briefing, you know for a fact that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=0.0s)]
*  Karine Jean-Pierre doesn't like you at all. But don't feel bad because she [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=2.92s)]
*  despises someone else more. She really dislikes a specific reporter from Africa. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=7.68s)]
*  His name is Simon Atiba. He works with Today News. He's had a lot of hostile [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=12.16s)]
*  encounters with Karine Jean-Pierre for some reason. Yesterday she freaked out on [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  him and stormed out of the press conference ending it early. We kept track [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=20.52s)]
*  of this weird psychodrama going on. Here are some clips from it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  I hear the question. I hear your question but we're not doing this the way you want it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=30.0s)]
*  This is a disrespect. It is. I'm done. Simon, I'm done. I'm done with you right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=36.8s)]
*  What's the difference between President Trump not doing anything while the capital [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  was being attacked and President Biden not doing anything while protesters, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  while the Supreme Court justices were under attack. To say that there is no [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  difference, that is just unbelievably wrong. I'm moving on. I'm moving on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=59.0s)]
*  I'm trying to answer your question. Go ahead, sir. I just tried and you wouldn't let me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=68.36s)]
*  I just tried and you would not let me, sir. So your colleague is going to ask a question. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=74.6s)]
*  Go ahead. No, I just I literally just tried to answer your question. You shut me down. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=80.56s)]
*  So now your colleague is going to. Let me ask a question first before you answer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=86.36s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. I'll see you tomorrow. Question out of respect for America. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=89.8s)]
*  It's a good thing she's unarmed or Simon and Thibaut would be in deep trouble. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  He's this correspondent for Today News Africa and obviously kind of a hero. He joins us today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=99.8s)]
*  Simon, thank you so much for coming on. You can feel it watching that tape. She is mad at you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=104.84s)]
*  Why do you think that is? Yes, first of all, thank you, Tucker, for having me on your show. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=111.56s)]
*  There's a reason why your show is the most watched show in news in the U.S. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=118.2s)]
*  because you bring people like me. It's been a disaster, a total [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=123.48s)]
*  catastrophe, a real nightmare covering the Biden White House. Right now, I'm the voice of Africa [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=129.72s)]
*  in the U.S., but I can confirm that the level of discrimination against me and against African [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=136.04s)]
*  journalists in the White House is outstanding. It's disgraceful. You know, it's been three months [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=143.0s)]
*  that we don't have questions at the White House, even as President Biden is about to receive 50 [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=150.84s)]
*  African heads of state in D.C. for the U.S.-African summit. She didn't even give us even a single [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=157.16s)]
*  question. I've been trying for the past three months, and you know, it's shocking because she's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=163.88s)]
*  black. She's an immigrant. I'm black. I'm also an immigrant, and she's discriminating against me [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=169.0s)]
*  more than the white people who were, the white lady who was there before, and it's shocking. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=174.6s)]
*  She should be ashamed of herself for doing that, and it's heartbreaking. She's obviously a bigot. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  You can see it in her face. She really, really dislikes you. Do you suppose it's because [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=188.04s)]
*  you don't have the same views that someone who looks like you should have, in her opinion? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=192.92s)]
*  Yes, so it, I believe that it has to do maybe with two or three things. The first thing, I sound [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=199.16s)]
*  different. I wasn't born here. I was born in Cameroon. I speak French. I speak different [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=205.16s)]
*  languages. I don't have the American accent. I tried. I failed, and I've decided to stick with [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=209.88s)]
*  my accent. So I'm an immigrant, and she doesn't like that, and I ask tough questions. For instance, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=215.16s)]
*  I will ask her, how is it understandable that President Biden is inviting 50 African heads of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=221.32s)]
*  state to the U.S. who will spend almost $50 million each, and he doesn't have five minutes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=228.84s)]
*  to spend with each of them? He wouldn't have any one-on-one with any of those African presidents [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=236.12s)]
*  who are coming here in countries where money is already a big problem. Why not have this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=240.92s)]
*  this meeting on Zoom, for instance? You know, and so I ask questions about COVID. How do you explain [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=246.2s)]
*  that one million people, if we have to go by the official figures, one million Americans were killed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  by COVID, and we don't know where COVID came? You lied to us. You told us the COVID came from bad to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=259.08s)]
*  human, and then now we understand that it probably came from the lab, and that's the most consequential [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=266.52s)]
*  question, and she wouldn't even allow Diana from, you know, Daily Color to ask that question, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=273.16s)]
*  and when I intervene and say that, no, you need to allow her to ask the question, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  you know I'm being blacklisted and it's unfortunate, it's disgraceful. Well, you are always welcome on [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=282.36s)]
*  this show, and I suspect we will see you again. Simon and Tiba, thank you so much. We're on your [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  side. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmusVtw2Px4&t=291.8s)]
