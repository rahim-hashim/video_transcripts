# Tucker: What is the point of having a government?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0)
*  And keep in mind, it's not just the police, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=0.0s)]
*  it's the military. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=2.48s)]
*  Hundreds of Navy SEALs, the estimate is, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=3.52s)]
*  could soon lose their job. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=5.92s)]
*  Thousands throughout the other services, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=7.04s)]
*  Marine Corps, Air Force, Army, Navy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=8.64s)]
*  Can we afford that? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=11.76s)]
*  At the state level, this is particularly painful. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=13.0s)]
*  Entire counties in the state of Maine, for example, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  will lose paramedic services tonight [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=17.38s)]
*  because of a vaccine mandate. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=20.0s)]
*  It takes effect at midnight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=21.16s)]
*  What does this mean for people who live in the state of Maine? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=23.04s)]
*  Lisa Keim is the state senator from the state, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  and we're happy to have her on tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=27.68s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=28.76s)]
*  Give us a sense of what this will mean [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  for people in the state of Maine. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=32.84s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=36.28s)]
*  Yes, tonight, as you said, at midnight, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=37.24s)]
*  EMS workers will no longer be answering calls. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=41.0s)]
*  And we don't know on the state level [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  how many have been let go, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=47.72s)]
*  but there will be 911 calls [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=50.44s)]
*  that go unanswered in the state of Maine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=52.82000000000001s)]
*  And the difference here in Maine [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  that's good to understand [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=56.88s)]
*  is that we have already done away [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=59.32s)]
*  with all philosophical and religious exemptions, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=61.32s)]
*  and it is very difficult to get a medical exemption at all. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=64.28s)]
*  So these EMS workers, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=68.08s)]
*  they are faced with the choice of feeding their family [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=70.08s)]
*  or taking the vaccine. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=73.64s)]
*  And I have talked to many people throughout the state. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  There are definitely dire consequences coming, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=78.76s)]
*  and we are not sure yet [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=81.2s)]
*  what the impact overall is going to be. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=82.76s)]
*  If your 911 call goes unanswered, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=85.96s)]
*  what's the point of having a government, honestly? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  Like, what's the point? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=91.55999999999999s)]
*  And why isn't there a revolt against this? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  There are absolutely, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  there's going to be a lot of people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=99.24s)]
*  that are gonna be hurt by this, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=101.08s)]
*  but at this moment, no one knows. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=103.52s)]
*  This really has not been well reported. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  The people that are living in communities [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=110.36s)]
*  where the entire EMS service, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=113.12s)]
*  or possibly 50% or a large percentage [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=115.4s)]
*  are no longer to be working, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=119.68s)]
*  those communities don't yet know. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  This is something that we are going to find out [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=122.72s)]
*  as it unfolds over the next week. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=125.36s)]
*  So people who suffer heart failure or have a stroke [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=128.16s)]
*  and call for an ambulance and it doesn't come, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=132.32s)]
*  some of those people will die as a result of this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=134.84s)]
*  That's the most dire consequence of all, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=140.12s)]
*  and that is one of the major concerns that we have. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=142.4s)]
*  I spoke with an EMS, the director of Maine EMS today, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=146.0s)]
*  and they have some preliminary numbers, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=149.96s)]
*  but they won't know until Sunday night [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  how many workers are actually gonna be getting done. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=155.0s)]
*  So at this point, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=158.24s)]
*  it's very strongly like mismanagement [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  to assume that the vaccine mandate is going to work. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  For these people who are actually the most careful [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  of anyone in our society, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=170.08s)]
*  they understand the transmission [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=171.76s)]
*  and they're careful of their patients. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=174.4s)]
*  And now we're kicking them out and saying, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=176.32s)]
*  your services are no longer needed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=179.24s)]
*  The Maine people don't know. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=181.24s)]
*  Right, so politicians know more than healthcare workers [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=182.8s)]
*  about medicine and everyone acts like that's normal, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=185.52s)]
*  but it's not normal and it's also untrue. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=187.92s)]
*  I appreciate, Senator Kym, you're coming on tonight. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=190.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSV-JeSGA0&t=191.84s)]
