# Ghislaine Maxwell might not rat for this reason: Brad Edwards
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc)
*  All right, Jeff Jeffrey Epstein's lover, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=0.0s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell, was found guilty for her role [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=1.84s)]
*  in the child sex trafficking ring. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=5.0s)]
*  But will anyone else be charged? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=6.94s)]
*  Brad Edwards is a civil rights attorney [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=8.94s)]
*  who represents more than 50 of Epstein's victims. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=10.6s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=13.88s)]
*  Are any of your clients going to name names [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=14.72s)]
*  of whether there was anyone else involved in this operation [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=18.32s)]
*  other than Maxwell and Epstein? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=21.52s)]
*  Are my clients going to name other people? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I mean, I think that that is going to happen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=28.74s)]
*  It would be preferable if those people, especially now, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=30.88s)]
*  would come forward and give us a call and talk to us [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=34.28s)]
*  because as we have seen by this verdict, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=37.56s)]
*  it's never too late to be held accountable [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=41.12s)]
*  and that's going to happen. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=43.36s)]
*  And it's never too late to come forward [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=44.66s)]
*  and share your story if you're a victim. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=46.16s)]
*  No, that's true. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=49.14s)]
*  And I guess for your clients, the 50 of them or more, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  with this verdict, did they feel like there was [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=53.9s)]
*  some kind of justice that was served? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=55.44s)]
*  Obviously, this was really late justice. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=57.1s)]
*  This case should have been prosecuted [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=59.9s)]
*  and investigated a long time ago, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  but did this ruling and verdict [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=63.04s)]
*  give them some kind of peace of mind? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=66.24s)]
*  This verdict did a lot for them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=69.78s)]
*  I mean, look, the government, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=71.48s)]
*  the way that they were treated the first time around [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  with the Jeffrey Epstein case in Florida [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=74.86s)]
*  caused them to lose a lot of confidence [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  in the system and the government. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=80.02s)]
*  And this went a long way toward resurrecting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=81.96s)]
*  that lost trust in all of them [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=84.64s)]
*  and like one of my clients said last night, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=87.8s)]
*  we finally feel like we matter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=89.2s)]
*  I think that's a really, really important comment [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=91.5s)]
*  and statement and it's pretty consistent [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  throughout the 20 or more clients [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=97.64s)]
*  that I've had a chance to speak to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  since the verdict came out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=100.64s)]
*  Brad, there's some speculation that Miss Maxwell [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=102.58s)]
*  in some effort to try to reduce her sentence [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=105.24s)]
*  might actually expose people who are involved as well [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=107.32s)]
*  and as we've reported, some of those people [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=110.06s)]
*  may be very famous and wealthy, maybe royals. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=112.66s)]
*  Do you think that she's gonna actually expose [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  who was all involved in this sex ring? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=118.33999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that Maxwell had a chance [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  for the last 10 years to tell all who she knew. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=123.66s)]
*  In fact, there was a time where she could have [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=126.96s)]
*  just simply ratted out her boyfriend, Jeffrey Epstein [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=128.32s)]
*  and probably done pretty good for herself and she didn't. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=130.4s)]
*  Doesn't seem to me that she's the kind of person [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=133.5s)]
*  who's gonna turn rat now, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=135.16s)]
*  especially on some of her good friends. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  That's not how she got where she is. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=139.4s)]
*  And honestly, she's the top of the pyramid. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=141.78s)]
*  Anybody that she rats out as someone [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  lower on the rungs than she is, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=146.9s)]
*  I can't imagine that's really gonna work down [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=148.74s)]
*  her sentence too significantly, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  even if she were to do that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  So Brad, I was a prosecutor for 10 years [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  and I tried a lot of cases like this, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=157.72s)]
*  these child sexual assault cases [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  and they absolutely destroy little girls. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=161.38s)]
*  It's not a short-term crime, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=163.96s)]
*  it's a crime that lasts with them [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=165.62s)]
*  for their whole lifetime. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=167.26000000000002s)]
*  And I'm grateful that you would represent [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=168.66s)]
*  over 50 other young women out there [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=171.78s)]
*  who had this happen to them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  How are they doing? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=175.04s)]
*  Are they putting their lives together right now? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=176.54s)]
*  Can you give us a quick update on how they're doing? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=178.28s)]
*  As you know, I haven't been a former prosecutor, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=182.32s)]
*  it's not a one size fits all. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=184.16s)]
*  Some of them are doing very well considering, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  but as you mentioned, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=189.56s)]
*  it is essentially a life sentence for most of them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  It's not pain and suffering that just goes away [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=193.66s)]
*  even with a verdict like this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=196.2s)]
*  And so I think I was asked previously [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  about the sentence that Gillian Maxwell is likely to receive, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=200.36s)]
*  which in essence will probably be a life sentence for her. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=204.24s)]
*  But considering that she was directly or indirectly [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=207.36s)]
*  the cause of a life sentence of pain and suffering [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=210.36s)]
*  for dozens if not hundreds of young women, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=213.52s)]
*  it's as close to justice as you could imagine. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=217.12s)]
*  But some of my clients are doing fairly well and some aren't. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  Listen Brad, thanks for doing the work [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=224.0s)]
*  and again, you destroy little girls' lives [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=225.2s)]
*  when you sexually assault them, no doubt. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=227.32s)]
*  Thanks for joining me tonight and thanks for your work. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAO6l-U7hUc&t=229.2s)]
