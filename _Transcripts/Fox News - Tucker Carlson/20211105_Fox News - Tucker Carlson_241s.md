# How schools are infecting kids with critical race theory
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk)
*  Tony Kinnett is the science coordinator at the Indianapolis Public Schools District in Indiana, and he's also the founder of Chalkboard Review. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=0.0s)]
*  You may have seen his video making the rounds on the internet today in the video. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=7.0s)]
*  Kinnett responds to claims from Democrats that critical race theory isn't taught in schools. Watch. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=11.0s)]
*  We do have critical race theory in how we teach. We tell our teachers to treat students differently based on color. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=17.0s)]
*  We tell our students that every problem is a result of white men and that everything Western civilization built is racist. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=23.0s)]
*  Capitalism is a tool of white supremacy. Those are straight out of Kimberley Crenshaw's main points verbatim in critical race theory. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=29.0s)]
*  The writings that formed the movement. This is in math, history, science, English, the arts, and it's not slowing down. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=36.0s)]
*  Tony Kinnett joins us now. So you're saying the Dodges. Yeah, they don't have CRT 101 after math class. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=43.0s)]
*  But what they do have is the entire CRT infused in every single course and every single classroom throughout the curriculum. Is that right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=52.0s)]
*  Absolutely. There's this very clever trick that a lot of administrators were pulled in education. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=62.0s)]
*  There are two things that consist of learning. We have curriculum, which is what the students are learning. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=67.0s)]
*  And then we have pedagogy, which is how it's taught. So we can officially tell parents we're not teaching critical race theory. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=72.0s)]
*  It's not in the Indiana academic standards, but all of a sudden the classroom door shuts and the teacher starts teaching through a lens of this race essentialism that pits students against each other based on their color. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=79.0s)]
*  So give some advice to parents out there. Perhaps they don't know if CRT is in the school that their kids are going to. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=90.0s)]
*  How would they go about discovering it? And if it is infected in the school district there where they live, what's their next step? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=98.0s)]
*  Well, the first thing you should really be doing is talking to your kids teachers. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=106.0s)]
*  So many of my parents had great conversations with me weekly on what was going on, not just inside my classroom, but inside the school. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=110.0s)]
*  There is this very interesting myth by the left that all of the teachers are on the left and the right believes it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=117.0s)]
*  A lot of teachers really just want to go in and teach and they are happy to have discussions with parents. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=123.0s)]
*  However, if you find that a teacher is being uncooperative, they're teaching things that really shouldn't be taught in a classroom, they're treating your kid different based on a color. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=128.0s)]
*  You have a responsibility to go to the principal, then to the superintendent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=136.0s)]
*  And if that doesn't work, you really should look into electing a much better school board that's going to serve your community based on merit, not on color. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=140.0s)]
*  What kind of damage to the child's brain does something like CRT do? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=147.0s)]
*  Oh, it's horrific. You get into high school courses where a teacher will open things up for discussion. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=151.0s)]
*  And we see this in English classes a lot. They'll talk about a piece of poetry. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=157.0s)]
*  They'll talk about something that a writer has brought to bear. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=161.0s)]
*  And then the teacher will portray it through a societal lens like critical race theory and then provide this Orwellian two minutes of hate. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=163.0s)]
*  And the students will be expected to talk about things in the essay or in cases in like Manhattan. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=170.0s)]
*  Students will be expected to say things from home that were brought up in a very racist way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=176.0s)]
*  And all of the students are expected to participate in this, to chip in a little bit of progressive ideology. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=182.0s)]
*  And it gets really sketchy really quickly for a kid that doesn't buy into the rest of the stuff. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=188.0s)]
*  And they don't do this in math, do they? They can't bring CRT into math, can they? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=193.0s)]
*  Oh, they sure can. They sure can. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=198.0s)]
*  Ethnomathematics is a huge thing that's coming to Indianapolis Public Schools. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=201.0s)]
*  We just had a very large meeting about it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=205.0s)]
*  And there's actually a program that's being developed with Indiana University that would analyze how a teacher teaches, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=207.0s)]
*  analyze the scores of the students, and then determine how racist a teacher is in teaching that math course. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=213.0s)]
*  Ethnomathematics. I haven't heard that one before. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=219.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Tony. That was eye-opening. We appreciate it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=223.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=227.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4uZGyh1uTk&t=237.0s)]
