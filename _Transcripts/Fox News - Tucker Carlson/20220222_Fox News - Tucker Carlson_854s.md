# Tucker: How will this conflict affect you?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, since the day that Donald Trump became president, Democrats in Washington have told [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=4.72s)]
*  you you have a patriotic duty to hate Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=8.94s)]
*  It's not a suggestion, it's a mandate. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=12.08s)]
*  Anything less than hatred for Putin is treason. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=14.56s)]
*  Many Americans have obeyed this directive. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=17.92s)]
*  They now dutifully hate Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=19.52s)]
*  Maybe you're one of them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=21.44s)]
*  Hating Putin has become the central purpose of America's foreign policy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=23.0s)]
*  It's the main thing that we talk about. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=25.88s)]
*  Entire cable channels are now devoted to it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=27.8s)]
*  Very soon, that hatred of Vladimir Putin could bring the United States into a conflict in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=30.32s)]
*  Eastern Europe. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=35.28s)]
*  Before that happens, it might be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=36.8s)]
*  what is this really about? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=40.68s)]
*  Why do I hate Putin so much? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Has Putin ever called me a racist? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=49.46s)]
*  Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=52.84s)]
*  two years? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=56.86s)]
*  Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=57.86s)]
*  Is he making fentanyl? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=61.42s)]
*  Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=62.98s)]
*  Does he eat dogs? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=64.9s)]
*  These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is no. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=66.78s)]
*  Vladimir Putin didn't do any of that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=69.78s)]
*  So why does permanent Washington hate him so much? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=72.3s)]
*  If you've been watching the news, you know that Putin is having a border dispute with [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=75.38s)]
*  a nation called Ukraine. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=78.3s)]
*  Now, the main thing to know about Ukraine for our purposes is that its leaders once [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=79.3s)]
*  sent millions of dollars to Joe Biden's family. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=83.22s)]
*  Not surprisingly, Ukraine is now one of Biden's favorite countries. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=85.84s)]
*  Biden has pledged to defend Ukraine's borders even as he opens our borders to the world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=93.84s)]
*  Invading America is called equity. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=94.84s)]
*  Invading Ukraine is a war crime. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=97.12s)]
*  So with every day, we move closer to some kind of conflict with Russia, conflict that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=99.44s)]
*  could easily spin out of control given that the people running this have no fine motor [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=103.0s)]
*  skills. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  The administration assures us this has nothing at all to do with repaying Joe Biden's personal [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  debts to Ukrainian oligarchs. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=112.64s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=114.14s)]
*  It's completely and totally unrelated. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=115.14s)]
*  The point here is to defend democracy, not that Ukraine is a democracy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  It is not a democracy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's president has arrested his main political opponent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=122.1s)]
*  He has shut down newspapers and television stations that have dared to criticize him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=125.0s)]
*  So in American terms, you would call Ukraine a tyranny. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=129.3s)]
*  But Joe Biden likes Ukraine, so Putin bad war good. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=133.46s)]
*  How will this conflict affect you? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=137.46s)]
*  It will affect you quite a bit, actually. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=139.06s)]
*  Energy prices in the United States are about to go way up. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=141.34s)]
*  And that means that everything you buy will become much more expensive, from the food [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=144.34s)]
*  you eat to the car you drive to tickets you need to take your family on vacation this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=148.14s)]
*  summer, assuming you can still afford vacation by then. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=151.94s)]
*  You're about to become measurably poor. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=155.18s)]
*  That's not a guess. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=156.98s)]
*  Joe Biden has admitted this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=158.22s)]
*  On the other hand, you're going to win an important moral victory against dastardly [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=160.1s)]
*  old Vladimir Putin, who is much, much worse than Justin Trudeau, just so you know. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=164.02s)]
*  So you can feel good about that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=168.54s)]
*  Because... because... [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=170.38s)]
*  Let's see, come to think of it, why would you feel good about that? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=173.38s)]
*  It seems like a pretty terrible deal for you and for the United States. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=176.54s)]
*  Hunter Biden gets a million dollars a year from Ukraine, but you can no longer afford [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=180.74s)]
*  to go out to dinner. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=184.34s)]
*  That's not a bargain. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=186.54s)]
*  So what are we missing here? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  What we're missing is the big picture. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=189.7s)]
*  And that's why Joe Biden has dispatched Kamala Harris to explain that picture to us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=191.18s)]
*  Kamala Harris's old job was to open America's border. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=195.7s)]
*  She did that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=198.54s)]
*  Her new job is to keep Ukraine's borders closed. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=199.54s)]
*  Kamala Harris was in Europe the other day to explain the whole thing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=202.82s)]
*  She began with a history lesson, letting the European peoples know about their recent past, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=205.74s)]
*  which she assumes they've forgotten since so few of them speak English. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=210.06s)]
*  She opened with a traditional salutation, listen guys, because that's the way real historians [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=213.96s)]
*  and statespeople talk. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=218.66s)]
*  Watch Kamala educate. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=220.58s)]
*  I mean, listen guys, we're talking about the potential for war in Europe. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=223.22s)]
*  I mean, let's really take a moment to understand the significance of what we're talking about. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=229.9s)]
*  It's been over 70 years. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  And through those 70 years, as I mentioned yesterday, there has been peace and security. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=237.58s)]
*  We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  Listen guys, you may be Europeans who live in Europe, but you don't fully understand [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=248.46s)]
*  the ramifications of war in Europe. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  That's your problem. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=255.5s)]
*  The thing about Europe, you've had peace and security for more than 70 years. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=256.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris just told the Europeans that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=260.66s)]
*  And that, by the way, is true if you don't count the breakup of Yugoslavia, which caused [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=262.94s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of deaths in the 1990s, or the Soviet occupation of half of the land [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=266.14s)]
*  mass which managed the enslavement of hundreds of millions. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=271.46s)]
*  But apart from that, Mrs. Lincoln, it's all been peace and security in Europe. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=275.26s)]
*  Until now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=279.38s)]
*  The Soviets were fine. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=280.38s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is bad. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=281.38s)]
*  What do we do about that? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=283.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris explained that too. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=284.98s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=286.54s)]
*  And the allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=287.54s)]
*  these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because remember also, we still [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=293.82s)]
*  sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=299.38s)]
*  And within the context then of the fact that that window is still open, although it is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=305.1s)]
*  absolutely narrowing, but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=310.02s)]
*  deterrence effect we believe has merit. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=316.62s)]
*  Got that? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=320.38s)]
*  Take a breath and let it sink in. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=321.38s)]
*  Here it is again. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  Quote, we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=323.97999999999996s)]
*  one, especially because remember also, we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=328.34s)]
*  path out of this moment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=332.62s)]
*  And within the context then of the fact that the window is still opening, still open, although [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=333.78s)]
*  it is absolutely narrowing, but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=337.9s)]
*  the deterrence effect we believe has merit. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=341.7s)]
*  Well, of course it has merit. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  The only question is, what the hell are you talking about? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=346.94s)]
*  And the answer is Kamala Harris has no real idea what she's talking about. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  She can't even point to the direction of what she's talking about. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=352.38s)]
*  Her mouth opens and pre-digested chunks of language come tumbling out in no particular [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=355.38s)]
*  order. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=359.34s)]
*  It's soothing to listen to until you try to understand what it means. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=360.58s)]
*  As Kamala Harris told us just last month, quote, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=364.98s)]
*  To which we'd respond, that's right, Ms. Vice President Person, today is the first day of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  the rest of your life. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=376.82s)]
*  Learn it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  Love it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  Live it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  And while you're at it, eat, pray, love. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  You can just imagine Vladimir Putin's reaction to all of this when an aide drops a translated [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=384.22s)]
*  transcript of Kamala Harris' remarks on his desk. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=388.38s)]
*  Clearly, Kamala Harris must be setting some sort of trap for the Russians here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=395.98s)]
*  Her words don't make sense. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  But she can't possibly be dim and childish. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=402.34000000000003s)]
*  America is a superpower. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  It would never put a senile man and an imbecile in charge of the country. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=407.46000000000004s)]
*  On the other hand, maybe so. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=412.5s)]
*  And by the way, it's not just our country. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=414.74s)]
*  A few weeks ago, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with his British counterpart, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=416.5s)]
*  Liz Truss. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=421.42s)]
*  Lavrov asked Truss if her country recognized Russian sovereignty over Rostov and Voronets, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=422.94s)]
*  both of which are actually parts of Russia. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=429.3s)]
*  So it was a trick question. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=432.66s)]
*  But Liz Truss, who used to work in sales, had no idea. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=434.18s)]
*  So she replied that Great Britain would never recognize these regions as Russian despite [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=438.54s)]
*  the fact they already are Russian. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=443.5s)]
*  So Liz Truss has no idea what she's talking about either. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=446.62s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=449.74s)]
*  She wasn't embarrassed about that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=450.74s)]
*  None of them are embarrassed about that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=452.3s)]
*  John Bolton knows a lot. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=454.22s)]
*  On the other hand, he spent decades weakening America with terrible foreign policy ideas [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=455.66s)]
*  and getting a lot of decent people killed for no good reason at all. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=459.5s)]
*  So you'd think at this point, if justice were real, John Bolton would be living in isolation [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=462.02000000000004s)]
*  and shame somewhere, spending his days in atonement. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=465.86s)]
*  That's what you would do. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=468.78000000000003s)]
*  But that's not what he's doing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=471.06s)]
*  Here's John Bolton on MSNBC demanding yet another war, this one with the nuclear-armed [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=472.06s)]
*  power watch. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=476.02s)]
*  Do you think that U.S. forces should actually go in to defend Ukraine? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=478.62s)]
*  Well, I think it's probably too late for that now. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=482.5s)]
*  But I would say this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=484.86s)]
*  The red line between being a treaty ally of the United States and not being one is significant. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=485.86s)]
*  But the issue, as in all issues like this, is would a Russian invasion and takeover of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=490.62s)]
*  Ukraine adversely affect American national security and that of its NATO allies? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=496.62s)]
*  The answer to that's absolutely yes. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=501.78000000000003s)]
*  We did not act appropriately early. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=503.66s)]
*  I think we should have had more American forces in Ukraine, not to fight the Russians, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=506.26s)]
*  but to train with the Ukrainians and to show those Russian generals looking across the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=511.98s)]
*  border and seeing American flags. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=516.3s)]
*  I wonder what that means. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=518.54s)]
*  Biden took that off the table, saying there would be no American forces involved, and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=520.02s)]
*  he got nothing for it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=523.9399999999999s)]
*  So the only problem with Joe Biden's Ukraine policy, says John Bolton, is that it's too [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=526.6s)]
*  weak. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=530.9399999999999s)]
*  Your kids aren't fighting there right now, hunkered down in February, shooting at Putin. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=531.9399999999999s)]
*  Let's try a winter war in Russia. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=535.96s)]
*  No one's done it before, but we have high hopes. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=537.48s)]
*  Alexander Vindman is in fact demanding it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=540.6s)]
*  Unlike the British Foreign Secretary, Alexander Vindman knows quite a bit about Ukraine. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=542.72s)]
*  In fact, he was born there. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  Alexander Vindman believes you have a moral obligation to defend his homeland, and if [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=548.6s)]
*  you don't, you're a murderer. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=552.0400000000001s)]
*  Watch him once again on MSNBC. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=554.2s)]
*  I think these folks, these right-wing pundits and the GOP that supports them, really frankly [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  have blood on their hands because they're encouraging and enticing this kind of opportunism [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=564.54s)]
*  from Putin. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=570.1s)]
*  And it's not just kind of plain rhetoric, like you could say something without consequences, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=571.1s)]
*  like too often happens in the United States. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=577.58s)]
*  This has real consequences, and people are going to die because of this. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=579.98s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to die. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=584.14s)]
*  So your job is to take up arms in defense of Alexander Vindman's home country, or else [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=586.56s)]
*  you're evil. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=591.98s)]
*  You have blood on your hands. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=592.98s)]
*  That's effectively our policy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=593.98s)]
*  Okay, Alexander Vindman, you got us. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=594.98s)]
*  It's a compelling argument. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=597.66s)]
*  We're in. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=598.82s)]
*  What's this going to cost us to defend the country we were born in? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=600.5s)]
*  Well, in fact, Joe Biden addressed that question today. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=603.02s)]
*  Defending freedom will have cost for us here at home, Biden said. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=606.1s)]
*  We need to be honest about it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=608.7s)]
*  Really. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=610.54s)]
*  Biden went on to outline what he called the pain of our sanctions. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=611.54s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=614.94s)]
*  We're implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=615.94s)]
*  V.E.B. and their military bank. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=622.54s)]
*  We're implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russian sovereign debt. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=625.38s)]
*  That means we've cut off Russia's government from Western financing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=629.78s)]
*  It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=633.86s)]
*  or European markets either. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=640.6999999999999s)]
*  Starting tomorrow and continuing in the days ahead, we'll also impose sanctions on Russian [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=643.38s)]
*  elites and their family members. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=648.26s)]
*  They share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=650.84s)]
*  Because of Russia's actions, we've worked with Germany to ensure Nord Stream 2 will [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=656.6s)]
*  not, as I promised, will not move forward. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=661.76s)]
*  So let's put aside the question of why you would ever want to shut down any energy pipeline [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=666.88s)]
*  anywhere ever. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=672.08s)]
*  Especially now, crude oil is nearing $100 a barrel. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  It's the highest price since 2014. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=677.64s)]
*  That's not a small thing because you need energy to live. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=680.48s)]
*  It's not negotiable. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=683.2s)]
*  So how does having less energy help the United States? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=684.36s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't even hint at an answer to that. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=688.44s)]
*  He didn't answer any questions. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=690.96s)]
*  He ran away the second he had finished reading the script. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=692.24s)]
*  Back in real life, every person knows nothing will tank our economy faster than cutting [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=695.8000000000001s)]
*  off the supply of fossil fuels. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=700.24s)]
*  Because despite what you may have heard from noted energy experts like Sandy Cortez, a [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=702.28s)]
*  country of 340 million people can't run on windmills and solar panels. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=706.84s)]
*  And even if we had enough of those, which we don't, we don't have the transmission [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=711.48s)]
*  lines to get that power to your house. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  And we won't for a long time. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=717.26s)]
*  So that's all a lie. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  But don't worry, says Kamala Harris. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=720.4200000000001s)]
*  The administration has ways of fixing the spike in energy prices. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=722.2s)]
*  They've got it under control because it turns out Kamala Harris is secretly in charge of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=725.84s)]
*  global energy markets. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=730.52s)]
*  No, just kidding. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=732.44s)]
*  Harris has no idea what a barrel of oil costs. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=734.1600000000001s)]
*  She doesn't know how natural gas is measured. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=736.52s)]
*  What she knows about is diversity, and that's pretty much it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=738.8s)]
*  Though she does sense that everything is about to get a lot more expensive for you. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=741.0s)]
*  And so to warn you, she mentioned it today. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=745.68s)]
*  The president has already said Americans will be facing some economic fallout or some hardships. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=749.36s)]
*  Can you explain to Americans what exactly will they face if this happens? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=753.96s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=757.76s)]
*  As the president talked about in his speech, we are aware that, again, when America stands [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=758.76s)]
*  for her principles and all of the things that we hold dear, it requires sometimes for us [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=764.24s)]
*  to put ourselves out there in a way that maybe we will incur some cost. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=771.76s)]
*  And in this situation, that may relate to energy costs, for example. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=776.8s)]
*  So what are the principles we're defending here? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=783.3s)]
*  We're defending a regime that has arrested their main rival and shut down opposition [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=786.24s)]
*  media. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=792.92s)]
*  And that's what's at stake here, apart from rewarding the Biden family's patron. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=794.5999999999999s)]
*  But at least she's honest enough to say what's happening in Eastern Europe, quote, may relate [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=797.88s)]
*  to energy costs. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=802.24s)]
*  That's a euphemism for good luck filling your truck this August. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=803.64s)]
*  Does that bother Kamala Harris? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=808.9599999999999s)]
*  Maybe it does in the short term. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=810.26s)]
*  Voters aren't going to like it in November. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=811.38s)]
*  Their party will be punished. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  But they're doing it anyway. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=814.7199999999999s)]
*  They're shutting down domestic energy pipelines here. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=815.8199999999999s)]
*  They're picking a fight with Europe's biggest gas supplier. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=818.4s)]
*  So maybe there's something bigger at work here. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yz0AXHWz5E&t=821.0s)]
