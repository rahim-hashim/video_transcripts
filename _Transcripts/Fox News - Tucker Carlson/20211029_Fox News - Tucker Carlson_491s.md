# Tucker: What a freak show
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, about 20 minutes into the 2016 presidential campaign, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=4.16s)]
*  it was pretty clear the American media were horribly addicted [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=8.32s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=11.96s)]
*  They hated Trump, obviously, but they also needed Trump [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=13.48s)]
*  in order to live. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=16.36s)]
*  And that's the face of addiction. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=17.48s)]
*  If you've ever seen a person grimace while gulping [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  a warm vodka before breakfast with shaky hands, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=21.56s)]
*  you know what it looks like. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  So there was really never any question [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=26.14s)]
*  about what was gonna happen for sure [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=27.6s)]
*  when news organizations were finally cut off [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=29.76s)]
*  from their vital daily supply of Donald Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  They were gonna collapse in a pile, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=34.92s)]
*  and that's exactly what they've done. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=36.6s)]
*  They've collapsed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=37.68s)]
*  On Tuesday, for example, not a single show on CNN [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  wants the most important cable news channel in the world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=41.96s)]
*  This is CNN. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=44.72s)]
*  Not a single show on the whole channel [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=46.74s)]
*  approached even 800,000 viewers. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=49.160000000000004s)]
*  That's really low. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=51.1s)]
*  Chris Cuomo would be better off doing free concerts [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=52.8s)]
*  in the park, which in fact he may soon be doing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=54.7s)]
*  So with Trump gone, the old formula no longer works. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=57.4s)]
*  That's easy to understand. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=62.24s)]
*  What's more confusing, harder to understand, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=63.84s)]
*  is how they've responded to this fact. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=66.34s)]
*  So let's say you'd made billions of dollars over the years [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  selling Rice Krispie treats to a hungry public. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=71.18s)]
*  Dentists may have complained about what you were doing, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=74.36s)]
*  but for you it was always a great business, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=76.52s)]
*  and you assumed it would go on forever [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=78.12s)]
*  because we always think everything good [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=79.46000000000001s)]
*  will go on forever, but it doesn't. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=81.2s)]
*  Over time, consumers started to figure out [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=83.2s)]
*  that a marshmallow coated with breakfast cereal, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=85.4s)]
*  not a very healthy food option. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=88.0s)]
*  It tastes great at first, eat enough, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  and it starts to make you feel sick. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  So they began to buy less of what you were selling. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  Following this, how would you react to that? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, if you were smart, you'd probably just rebrand. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  You'd change the color, you'd throw in some vitamin additives, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  you'd rename the product. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  You might call it crunchy kale treats [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=107.5s)]
*  or healthy life nutrition bars. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=109.44s)]
*  You'd have figured out that people [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=112.26s)]
*  don't want sugary garbage, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  they want something that's good for them, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=114.52s)]
*  so you would sell it to them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  That seems like a pretty rational choice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=118.0s)]
*  What you probably wouldn't do [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=120.36s)]
*  if you were selling Rice Krispie treats [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=122.08s)]
*  to a rapidly shrinking market is convince yourself [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=123.84s)]
*  that you were not in the snack food business, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  but instead on some kind of mission from God. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=128.54s)]
*  You would not claim that eating marshmallows [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=131.78s)]
*  is a vital moral imperative. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  You would not attack your own consumers [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=136.28s)]
*  for preferring something else. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  You would not denounce them as morons or racists [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  for eating less sugar. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=144.0s)]
*  You wouldn't try and ban the Atkins diet [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=145.64s)]
*  and make keto illegal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=147.8s)]
*  That'd be insane, you'd go bankrupt if you did that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=150.0s)]
*  And yet that's exactly what the legacy media [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=153.16s)]
*  have decided to do as they face extinction. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=155.24s)]
*  They've amped up the moral outrage, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=158.72s)]
*  they've turned the self-righteousness [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=160.72s)]
*  all the way up to 11, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=162.28s)]
*  and above all, they pretended that nothing has changed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=164.28s)]
*  and that Donald J. Trump still strides the horizons [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=167.54s)]
*  of great orange colossus [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=170.6s)]
*  who threatens the very existence of this fragile nation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=172.28s)]
*  We're not overstating it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  Here's a recent sample of cable news coverage [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=176.68s)]
*  in this country. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=179.08s)]
*  And keep in mind as you watch, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  every one of these clips was recorded this week. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=181.16s)]
*  Election officials are growing more fearful for their lives [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=185.88s)]
*  as Donald Trump continues his big lie. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=188.44s)]
*  President Trump continues to push lies about the election, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=190.84s)]
*  about election results across the country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  Where would we be today if the Trump White House [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  simply listened to the science? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=199.68s)]
*  Trump wants to overturn the next election, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=201.32s)]
*  he wants to overturn the last one, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=203.44s)]
*  he wants to limit voting and overturn elections [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=204.88s)]
*  at the state level. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=207.76s)]
*  Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy denounced the insurrection, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=208.68s)]
*  denounced Donald Trump. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=213.2s)]
*  As President Trump has found a surprising new platform [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=214.88s)]
*  to spread the big lie. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the thing with Trump is, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=219.44s)]
*  Trump is always bad for democracy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  It has metastasized much far beyond President Trump, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  right, from multiple sources. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=226.6s)]
*  I hear you there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=227.72s)]
*  However, the original cancer was President Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=228.76s)]
*  What a freak show. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=232.88s)]
*  No wonder nobody watches, who would watch that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=234.72s)]
*  But listen to what they're saying. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  Trump wants to overturn the next election, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  screams the pudgy midget. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=240.56s)]
*  They all do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=243.0s)]
*  But the fact is that Donald Trump [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  is no longer the President of the United States, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=245.6s)]
*  he's golfing right now in Florida, good for him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=247.04s)]
*  How about covering what's happening in America right now? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  Ton of change. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Maybe he could explain it to us or even tell us about it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=253.88s)]
*  Nope, they refuse. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=256.0s)]
*  And they refuse because they are caught in an earlier age. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=258.24s)]
*  They can't adjust to a new reality. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=261.08s)]
*  It's depressing when you think about it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=262.92s)]
*  That's gonna be all of us someday. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=264.08s)]
*  It's certainly very sad for them. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=265.76s)]
*  Just a few years ago, hosting a Sunday show on television [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  was considered a very big deal, especially in Washington. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, nobody cares. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=273.48s)]
*  It's irrelevant. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=275.36s)]
*  Imagine if you were the host of one of those shows. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  Chuck Todd doesn't need to imagine [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=279.52s)]
*  he is the host of one of those shows. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  He spent his entire life trying to get this gig [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=282.48s)]
*  only to discover once he got it that it's not worth having. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  No wonder he seems so bitter and fragile. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=288.2s)]
*  Here he is earlier this year. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=290.88s)]
*  This was started when the mainstream media [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=293.08s)]
*  stopped, dropped any pretense of being unbiased [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  and actually chose sides during this election. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=298.88s)]
*  This fire was started when you completely ignored, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=301.12s)]
*  for example, our investigation of Hunter Biden. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=303.8s)]
*  No evidence of wrongdoing there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=306.24s)]
*  And now we find out after the election, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=307.68s)]
*  no, there is a fair amount of evidence [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=309.48s)]
*  to the point that we have a real FBI investigation. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=310.68s)]
*  Senator, all right, I've had enough of hearing this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=312.76s)]
*  No, listen, I've had enough of this too. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=316.0s)]
*  It's the bias in the media. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=318.12s)]
*  You have spent the last two years. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  Where Republicans and conservatives [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=322.08s)]
*  do not trust the mainstream media. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  And that is what's destroyed the credibility [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=326.84s)]
*  of the media and our institutions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=329.44s)]
*  And really, the destruction of the institutions. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=331.44s)]
*  And result. So I can start this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=334.68s)]
*  Senator, I've had enough. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=338.08s)]
*  Chuck Todd literally can't even bear to listen [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  to someone criticize the American news media. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  Nobody has to now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  Settle down, Chuck. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  No one is interested in what you think anymore. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=347.84s)]
*  Your moral authority is long gone, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  along with your relevance. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=351.56s)]
*  You're shouting into the void. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=352.52s)]
*  They all are. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  Deep down, Chuck Todd knows that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=355.52s)]
*  They all know that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  But rather than accept the truth about themselves [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=358.23999999999995s)]
*  and their careers, rather than change their behavior [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  or acquire brand new skills, that'd be nice. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  Or gracefully retire to Cabo. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=366.0s)]
*  Again, this is coming for all of us. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=368.44s)]
*  They won't. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  They have one final hope for keeping their scam alive. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's censorship. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=374.64s)]
*  So the dying media companies have convinced themselves [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=376.84s)]
*  that somehow they can get the government [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=379.0s)]
*  and their friends at the tech monopolies [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=381.0s)]
*  to shut down their competitors. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  Maybe they can keep it going. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=384.4s)]
*  Maybe they'll be important and lucrative businesses again. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=385.84s)]
*  Maybe we can return to 2003, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=388.84s)]
*  a time when people delayed their golf games [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  to watch Meet the Press. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=392.64s)]
*  Wouldn't that be great? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=394.2s)]
*  That's their goal, deluded as it is. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  And it explains why all of a sudden, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  journalists of all people are leading the charge [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=400.32s)]
*  against the First Amendment [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=404.32s)]
*  that you thought made their jobs possible. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=405.56s)]
*  This tells you exactly why they hate Fox News [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=408.32s)]
*  so obsessively, and sub stack too. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  This is the key to their campaign [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=413.12s)]
*  against what they call misinformation. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=414.52s)]
*  Now, if you're a literal minded person, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=417.36s)]
*  and we certainly are, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=419.08s)]
*  you laugh every time you hear them say that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=420.0s)]
*  Misinformation? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  Aren't these the exact same people who told us [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=422.88s)]
*  that Putin got Trump elected? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=424.64s)]
*  The ones who swore that some high school kid [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=426.36s)]
*  from Kentucky was in the Klan? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=427.88s)]
*  Yeah, same people. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=430.08s)]
*  So of course they're not against misinformation, obviously. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=432.2s)]
*  The point is, they want to restore their monopoly on it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=435.84s)]
*  And that's what they're trying to do. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=440.24s)]
*  So we want to bring you an update. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=444.0s)]
*  Right at the top of the show tonight [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=445.08s)]
*  to the Virginia Governor's race. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=446.56s)]
*  That race took a bizarre and deeply revealing turn today. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  So several people carrying torches, neo-Nazis, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=453.48s)]
*  showed up in front of a campaign bus for Glenn Youngkin. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=457.24s)]
*  He's the Republican candidate in that race. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=460.16s)]
*  They chanted, we're all in for Glenn. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=462.24s)]
*  So the entire internet exploded, of course. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=466.04s)]
*  Every left-wing influencer on Twitter was telling you, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=468.44s)]
*  see, Glenn Youngkin's a Nazi. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=471.16s)]
*  But it turns out these weren't actually [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=474.20000000000005s)]
*  Glenn Youngkin supporters. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=475.72s)]
*  It's an amazing story, really. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMfOJPeV9A&t=477.24s)]
