# Tucker: More and more parents are choosing this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE)
*  So parents are voting at their school boards, pulling their children out of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=0.0s)]
*  public schools and they're doing it for a reason. They don't want their kids to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=4.0s)]
*  be indoctrinated by crazy people. Rachel Wilson is a homeschooling advocate who [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  lives in the rural Midwest. She understands what's happening and the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=10.52s)]
*  scale of it. She joins us tonight. Rachel, thanks so much for coming on. So how big [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=12.98s)]
*  has homeschooling become in the face of the collapse of public education? Thank [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=18.0s)]
*  you so much for having me on, Tucker. This pandemic, we are now two years into [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=24.6s)]
*  it and homeschooling has increased fourfold from the beginning of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=29.36s)]
*  pandemic to last fall according to a US Census survey. In addition to that, yeah [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=34.0s)]
*  the biggest that we've ever seen and in addition to that we're hearing data [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=41.6s)]
*  scientists tell us that a full 25% of all jobs in North America will be remote [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  by the end of this year. So I don't think this trend is going anywhere and I think [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  a lot more parents are going to be finding themselves at home a lot more [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=55.98s)]
*  often with their children, which I think is a wonderful silver lining to this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  situation. I don't think that anybody watching this show could say they're [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=64.7s)]
*  fully satisfied with how authority figures have handled this pandemic. We [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=69.1s)]
*  see oligarchs around the world trying to institute a great reset and kind of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  remake society in their image, but the good thing is that what man intends for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=78.42s)]
*  evil, God uses for good. So we have a golden opportunity here, which is that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=83.22s)]
*  the biggest demographic of people who have left the workforce and either [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=88.94s)]
*  stayed home or started working remotely are mothers of school-aged children. So [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=93.34s)]
*  we're in a special situation to take advantage of this and use it to our own [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=98.82s)]
*  benefit to kind of get away from sending our kids somewhere seven or eight hours [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=103.58s)]
*  a day to be indoctrinated by people who quite frankly are enemies to a more [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=109.26s)]
*  traditional conservative or Christian way of life. And instead of those people [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=114.38000000000001s)]
*  teaching our children our morals, our culture, our values, we can go back to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  having parents and mothers teaching our kids those values. I mean what you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  described is beautiful and they are avowed enemies of your family and of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=130.74s)]
*  your children. Very quickly, I think the main concern for a lot of people [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=134.38s)]
*  thinking about this is will my kids grow up to be weird? I mean are they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=137.82s)]
*  socialized at all with no classmates? Right, people have a lot of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=140.7s)]
*  concerns or worries when they think about homeschooling. Public education is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=146.6s)]
*  actually kind of new. It's only really been the standard for about a century [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=151.9s)]
*  and prior to that we had other ways of educating people. So the good news I tell [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=155.1s)]
*  people is that it's really not that hard. You do not have to be an expert, you [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=159.74s)]
*  don't have to be a teacher, and you don't have to worry about not being able [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=163.3s)]
*  to socialize your kids either. We have so many ways that we can do that now, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=167.62s)]
*  especially with the internet, all the bad that comes with it. There's a lot of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=174.18s)]
*  good too. So we can get children into church, we can get them into [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=178.38000000000002s)]
*  intramural sports, and a lot of public schools also let kids do sports and band [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=184.66000000000003s)]
*  and things like that through the school as well. Well they should, you pay for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=190.34s)]
*  them. Rachel thanks for joining us. Also a firearms instructor I should [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=193.38000000000002s)]
*  point out. Great to see you too. Yeah. Thanks so much. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwiOSCt5ClE&t=197.18s)]
