# Tucker: Karine Jean-Pierre knows the script cold
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=0.0s)]
*  So if you're the White House press secretary, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=2.64s)]
*  and thank God you're not, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  but if you were, you would have two tasks every day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=5.44s)]
*  You gotta learn the president's views [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=8.6s)]
*  on what's happening in the world so you can repeat them. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=10.36s)]
*  And then you've gotta try to remember the names [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=12.96s)]
*  of those weird looking people sitting in the folding chairs [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=14.88s)]
*  in the briefing room. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=17.36s)]
*  So it's not an easy job, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=18.96s)]
*  but it's not a very rewarding one either. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=20.32s)]
*  You're not making policy, you're not making decisions, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=22.32s)]
*  you're repeating the party line. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=24.84s)]
*  Under normal circumstances, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=27.0s)]
*  it takes a lot more creativity to say, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=28.28s)]
*  sell lipstick for L'Oreal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  than it does to be White House press secretary. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=31.68s)]
*  They're all worn out by the end. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Except under Joe Biden, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=35.68s)]
*  it's a totally different job under Joe Biden. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=36.68s)]
*  The rules have changed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=39.32s)]
*  If you're Joe Biden's press secretary, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=40.64s)]
*  you've gotta be able to think on the fly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  because your boss can't. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=44.44s)]
*  So every time Biden goes outside, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=46.6s)]
*  you're gonna be called upon to translate what he said [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=48.52s)]
*  or explain what he really meant, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=50.8s)]
*  assuming for the sake of argument [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  that he really meant anything at all. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=53.56s)]
*  I know you're frustrated, Biden said today, for example, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  I can taste it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=58.24s)]
*  What does frustration taste like? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=60.2s)]
*  An earthy, slightly unctuous blend of bacon notes, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  mango and raspberry with an undertone of saddle leather? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=65.52s)]
*  Maybe Joe Biden didn't say. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=68.52s)]
*  The White House press secretary would know that's her job. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=71.16s)]
*  Or to name another example, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=74.44s)]
*  which United States senators represent the state of Florida [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=75.84s)]
*  and which represent the state of Wisconsin, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  which is not near Florida? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=80.6s)]
*  Well, the press secretary would have to know that too [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=82.36s)]
*  in case Biden screws it up, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  as of course he just did today, et cetera. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=85.96s)]
*  So it's not an easy gig. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  And it's a particularly tough job [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=90.84s)]
*  when the topics are serious, like nuclear war. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=92.36s)]
*  A few weeks ago, Joe Biden pledged [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=95.36s)]
*  to overthrow the government of Russia, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=96.96s)]
*  which is fully capable of waging nuclear war, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=99.08s)]
*  possessing as it does, at least 6,000 nuclear warheads. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=101.24s)]
*  That's not a small thing, starting a global conflagration [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=104.32s)]
*  and ending human life on the planet. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=107.44s)]
*  So it fell to the press secretary to clean it up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=109.96s)]
*  We are not advocating for killing the leader [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=112.72s)]
*  of a foreign country or regime change, Jen Psaki explained, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  despite the fact that Joe Biden had just advocated [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=118.44s)]
*  for regime change in Russia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=121.92s)]
*  So it's a lot of power. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=124.8s)]
*  How did somebody like Jen Psaki, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=126.0s)]
*  someone so demonstrably talentless, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=128.24s)]
*  a humorless gender studies major from Greenwich, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=130.8s)]
*  how'd this person get this much authority in our government? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=133.24s)]
*  Good question. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=137.36s)]
*  Nowadays just comes with the job of press secretary. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=138.52s)]
*  Just hours ago, Psaki explained that federal law [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=141.32s)]
*  no longer applies to mobs of Biden voters. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=144.08s)]
*  They get to intimidate all the Supreme Court justices [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  they want as long as they're on the right side of abortion. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=148.96s)]
*  And we're quoting now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=152.52s)]
*  We certainly continue to encourage protests [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  outside judges' homes, she said, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=156.84s)]
*  and in so saying reversed hundreds of years of policy [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=158.68s)]
*  and tradition and took yet another blow [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=161.8s)]
*  against civilization and decency. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=165.12s)]
*  She could do that because she's the press secretary. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=167.12s)]
*  She's Jen Psaki, or was. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=170.24s)]
*  Next week, she's headed to MSNBC [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=172.24s)]
*  for a new Life is a Cable News contributor. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  Wish her luck, of course. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  Good luck, Jen Psaki. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=177.24s)]
*  But in the meantime, you've got to wonder [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=178.8s)]
*  who's gonna replace her. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  Who could replace her? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Is anyone qualified? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=182.96s)]
*  Is there another person in this country [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  as shallow, nasty, and partisan as Jen Psaki is? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=186.84s)]
*  Well, there is. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  Her name is Corrine Jean-Pierre. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  Listen to Jen Psaki. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=194.0s)]
*  Jen Psaki describe Corrine Jean-Pierre. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=195.68s)]
*  First, as you all know, she will be the first black woman, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=200.0s)]
*  the first out LGBTQ plus person to serve in this role. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=203.76s)]
*  The first black woman and out gay person [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=208.76s)]
*  to speak for the president. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=211.4s)]
*  Becoming the first black woman and LGBTQ person. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=212.8s)]
*  The first black woman, first openly gay person. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=217.32s)]
*  The first black woman, the first openly gay person. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=220.2s)]
*  The first black person, first openly gay person. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=224.12s)]
*  Becoming the first black person [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  and first openly LGBTQ person [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=228.64s)]
*  to serve as White House press secretary. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=231.28s)]
*  Well, you heard it from Jen Psaki. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=234.0s)]
*  She's going to be the first quote out LGBTQ plus person [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  to be White House press secretary, and thank God. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=240.04s)]
*  But before you light a candle [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  and begin tonight's celebrations, a quick question. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  What does LGBTQ plus mean? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=248.2s)]
*  Hey, Jen Psaki, let us know if you have a minute. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  Explain every letter in that acronym [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  and specifically what it signifies. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=256.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, wait, don't hold your breath. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=259.32000000000005s)]
*  She's not gonna do it because like everybody else [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=261.68s)]
*  who uses that phrase, Jen Psaki literally has no idea, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=263.92s)]
*  no clue at all what it means. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=266.68s)]
*  It's one of those terms you're not supposed to define. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=268.72s)]
*  One day you just start using an LGBTQ plus [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=271.24s)]
*  and anyone who asks what it means [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=274.24s)]
*  is immediately presumed to be in the out group. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  So it's not actually a word. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  Words are meant to signify meaning [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  and communicate it to other people. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=284.36s)]
*  Oh, it's not that at all. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a litmus test and you could fail. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, you don't know what LGBTQ plus means? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=290.04s)]
*  Keep an eye on that person, hates gays. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=292.88s)]
*  But whatever, don't ask questions. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=295.68s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre is our first out LGBTQ plus [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=297.76s)]
*  White House press secretary, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=301.48s)]

*  It's a good thing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=304.72s)]
*  Shut up and celebrate. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=305.88s)]
*  That's why she got the job. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  She's in the right group. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=308.36s)]
*  And to the Biden administration, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  which thinks exclusively in terms of groups [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  and never in terms of individuals, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  because individuals are messy and inconvenient, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=315.04s)]
*  the group is all that matters. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=317.56s)]
*  This is exactly how they pick Supreme Court justices [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  or vice presidents or members of the Federal Reserve Board. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=321.24s)]
*  And now the all important press secretary gig [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=324.16s)]
*  has gone to someone on the basis of group. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=326.92s)]
*  It's really simple. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=328.8s)]
*  Show us your picture and we'll tell you [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  if you're qualified for the job. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=331.68s)]
*  And in many ways, Corrine Jean-Pierre is perfect for the job. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  Not only is she a member of the out LGBTQ plus community, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  she is also critically the product [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=342.0s)]
*  of a private school and an Ivy League college [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=345.12s)]
*  and yet still oppressed somehow. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  She is furious at America, despite her ample privilege [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  and enraged by its racist systems of oppression. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=354.12s)]
*  And she's happy to tell you about it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=357.44s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=359.24s)]
*  When he got elected, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  I think people thought we were in a post-racial America [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=361.88s)]
*  and we were not. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  I think what we learned is that racism was very much real [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=366.48s)]
*  and still very much around. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=369.48s)]
*  And the obstruction that he saw, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  the horrible racist rhetoric [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=374.04s)]
*  of having a black family in the White House [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  was very clear that you felt the hate and you saw the hate. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=381.16s)]
*  I just think that America has a really big problem with race [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=384.88s)]
*  and it's very real. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=390.88s)]
*  Yeah, they keep electing Obama and promoting me [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=393.92s)]
*  despite the fact I have no qualifications for the job. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=397.24s)]
*  Lesson, it's a racist country. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=400.0s)]
*  Now there's a word for this, kind of a clever term, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=402.52s)]
*  it's called crybullying, right? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=404.35999999999996s)]
*  Stop hitting me, they say as they punch you in the face. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=407.4s)]
*  Why do they do it? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=409.76s)]
*  Well, they do it because it works. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  You whine about racism and you get into the best schools, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=412.2s)]
*  you get promoted and eventually run the federal government [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  and your presence atop the food chain [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=417.84s)]
*  is nothing if not evidence that the country is still racist. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=421.03999999999996s)]
*  It has to be, or you can't justify your job. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  Kind of an amazing scam. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=427.96s)]
*  People like Corrine Jean-Pierre have going. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=430.88s)]
*  She's perfected, she used to work for MSNBC, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  she knows the script cold. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  Here she is in 2020 yelling some more about racism. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=438.32s)]
*  Now, if you imagine that COVID came from a lab in Wuhan, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=441.52s)]
*  which by the way is true, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=446.64s)]
*  then according to Corrine Jean-Pierre, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  you're not a person trying to get to the truth, no. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=451.12s)]
*  Can you guess what you are? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  You're a racist. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=457.12s)]
*  The easy pivot is race, is ethnicity. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=458.76s)]
*  You say it's a foreign virus. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  I've noticed people tweeting Chinese coronavirus. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=462.44s)]
*  That's what Tucker Carlson said, right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=466.32s)]
*  When you look at Fox News, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=469.0s)]
*  Fox News was racist before coronavirus, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=470.08s)]
*  they are racist during the coronavirus, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=472.84s)]
*  Fox News will be racist after the coronavirus. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  So there is nothing new here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=477.36s)]
*  So criticizing the Chinese government, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  the most powerful organization in the world, is racist. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=483.84s)]
*  Of course, criticizing the powerful is always racist. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=488.08s)]
*  America itself is racist. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  Talking about COVID is racist. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=494.12s)]
*  What isn't racist? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=495.88s)]
*  Well, we checked Corrine Jean-Pierre's Twitter feed [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  to find out what isn't racist. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=500.32s)]
*  Couldn't find much, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  but we did find a very long list of things that are. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=503.56s)]
*  Here is a non-exhaustive sample that we compiled [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=506.91999999999996s)]
*  of racist people and things [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=510.2s)]
*  according to Joe Biden's news press secretary. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=512.1999999999999s)]
*  John Cornyn is racist. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=514.72s)]
*  Joe Arpaio is racist. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=517.12s)]
*  Border Walls, needless to say, are racist. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  Roseanne Barr, for some reason, is racist. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=523.5200000000001s)]
*  The name Pocahontas is racist, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=526.44s)]
*  despite the fact it was an actual American Indian's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  real name, whatever, it's racist. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  Mike Huckabee may seem nice, but he's racist. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  Federal government shutdowns don't seem like [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=537.48s)]
*  they have anything to do with race. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=539.36s)]
*  Oh, they're racist too. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=540.6800000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, racist, that's a no-brainer, you knew that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=542.6800000000001s)]
*  Jeff Sessions, also racist. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=545.24s)]
*  Brexit, again, not connected to race. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=547.52s)]
*  Doesn't mean it's not racist. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=552.16s)]
*  It is, according to Corrine Jean-Pierre. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=553.36s)]
*  Ed Gillespie, former Senate candidate in Virginia, racist. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=556.92s)]
*  Thank God he didn't win. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=561.04s)]
*  Ron DeSantis did win in Florida, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=562.16s)]
*  and that's bad news, because guess what he is? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=563.8s)]
*  Racist. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=565.32s)]
*  Steve Bannon, racist. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=566.44s)]
*  Sebastian Gorka, racist. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=568.88s)]
*  And you know who's most racist of all? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=571.6s)]
*  Republicans who criticized Ralph Northam [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=573.76s)]
*  for wearing blackface in a Klan outfit. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  You're racist, racist, if you notice racism, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=579.4s)]
*  as long as the racist is a Democrat. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=583.12s)]
*  So awesome. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=587.6s)]
*  Give that girl a big job. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=589.48s)]
*  Now you may be rolling your eyes, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=592.84s)]
*  because you've heard all of this a million times before. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=594.12s)]
*  Ice cream and Shakespeare are racist. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=596.12s)]
*  But think about it for a second. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=598.96s)]
*  This is the person the Biden administration [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=600.52s)]
*  hired to tell the rest of us what Joe Biden really means [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=604.32s)]
*  when he says, for example, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=607.32s)]
*  he's going to kill Vladimir Putin. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=608.4s)]
*  How long until this person calls Putin a racist? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  She probably already has. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=616.72s)]
*  How's that gonna turn out in the middle of a war? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  We might not have to wait long to find out. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=620.64s)]
*  Here's yet another incredibly racist thing, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=622.72s)]
*  according to America's new press secretary. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=625.36s)]
*  Of course, it is voter identification laws. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=627.0s)]
*  Now, you will find voter ID laws in every country [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=629.12s)]
*  on the planet, including in Africa, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  but that doesn't make them any less racist. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=634.36s)]
*  And in order to get these voter suppression laws, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=637.88s)]
*  besides gutting the Voting Rights Act, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=640.64s)]
*  you also gotta get your people in there [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=643.76s)]
*  to put these awful laws in place. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=645.8s)]
*  I'm so glad that the Georgia issue [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=648.16s)]
*  is being talked about almost every day now. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=650.4s)]
*  It's getting national attention, and it needs to, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  because what's happening is pure racism. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=655.36s)]
*  Oh, it's pure racism. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVld2u-PQI&t=659.1999999999999s)]
