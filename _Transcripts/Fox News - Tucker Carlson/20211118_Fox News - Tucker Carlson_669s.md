# Tucker: Actions like this threaten America's judicial system
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, the judge in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial has just sent the jurors home for the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=4.8s)]
*  night to think about the trial for yet another day. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=8.68s)]
*  So far deliberations in this case have lasted about 20 hours. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  In a normal proceeding, we'd have the jury's decision in about 20 minutes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=15.48s)]
*  The essential question in this case is really clear. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=19.48s)]
*  Did Kyle Rittenhouse have good reason to believe dangerous men were trying to murder him? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=21.88s)]
*  And the answer is also clear and unequivocal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=25.8s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=28.16s)]
*  These people were definitely trying to murder Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=29.64s)]
*  So Rittenhouse's response to that threat was the definition of self-defense. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=32.84s)]
*  Desperate split-second decisions made in the face of unwanted aggression in an attempt [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=36.92s)]
*  to save his own life. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=40.4s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=42.24s)]
*  Every person who testified at the trial on both sides confirmed that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=43.24s)]
*  No honest person doubts it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=46.24s)]
*  So Kyle Rittenhouse never should have been charged in the first place, and yet he was. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=48.82s)]
*  And the reason he was is very simple. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=52.08s)]
*  From the beginning, this case was driven by politics, and ever since, it's been tainted [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=54.28s)]
*  by government deception and incompetence. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=58.48s)]
*  For example, we're just learning now relevant new evidence in the case. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=65.8s)]
*  This is evidence the jury should have seen before it began deliberation, obviously, on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=66.8s)]
*  the basis supposedly of all known facts. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=70.56s)]
*  So it is to say this is not how our legal system is supposed to work. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=73.96s)]
*  Here's what we've learned. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=76.92s)]
*  One of the charges that Kyle Rittenhouse faces is a felony count for, quote, recklessly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  endangering the safety of a man who until today had never been identified. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=82.32s)]
*  Video footage from the night of August 25th shows this man kicking Kyle Rittenhouse in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=86.5s)]
*  the face and knocking him down. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=90.9s)]
*  Rittenhouse responds by firing his rifle twice, and both times he missed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=93.54s)]
*  Tonight, the jury is considering whether Rittenhouse acted recklessly when he fired those two shots. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=97.7s)]
*  And yet, and here's the point, the jury has no idea as it deliberates who this man is, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=103.7s)]
*  because the prosecution never identified him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=109.42s)]
*  Prosecutors claimed they didn't know his identity, and they had no way to find it out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=111.86s)]
*  So that means that Rittenhouse's defense attorneys never got to cross-examine this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=115.66s)]
*  man or introduce any evidence about his behavior that night. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  That's not a small thing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=123.22s)]
*  According to the Daily Mail, new reporting today, that man's name is Maurice Freeland. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=125.1s)]
*  Freeland has admitted that he attacked Rittenhouse moments before another man, a domestic abuser [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=130.82s)]
*  called Anthony Huber, started bashing Rittenhouse in the head with a skateboard. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=135.06s)]
*  So who is Maurice Freeland? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=138.5s)]
*  Well according to the Daily Mail, he's a career criminal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=140.5s)]
*  He has opened charges for domestic abuse, disorderly conduct, and criminal damage to property. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=142.76s)]
*  In one case, a woman reported to authorities that Freeland, quote, threw her to the ground [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=147.66s)]
*  and kicked her in her lower right rib cage. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=151.28s)]
*  So what we learn here, among other things, is that every single person Kyle Rittenhouse [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  shot or shot at on August 25th in Kenosha had a lengthy and violent criminal record. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=158.98s)]
*  Well, that seems relevant, but the jury doesn't know it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  Thanks to unethical behavior by the prosecution, Maurice Freeland never had to testify in court [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=168.68s)]
*  and yet apparently, Freeland told prosecutors that he wanted immunity before he would agree [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=173.52s)]
*  to appear on the stand. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=177.56s)]
*  The assistant district attorney in the case, Thomas Binger, refused to provide that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=179.26000000000002s)]
*  That means the state knew all along exactly who Maurice Freeland was, but they withheld [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  that information from Kyle Rittenhouse's lawyers. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=189.3s)]
*  And as a result of that, Kyle Rittenhouse was deprived of his constitutional right under [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=192.62s)]
*  the Confrontation Clause to challenge his accuser in open court. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=196.94s)]
*  That's not supposed to happen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=202.02s)]
*  It can't happen. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=203.02s)]
*  And that's not the only relative evidence that was withheld from Kyle Rittenhouse's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=204.28s)]
*  lawyers during this trial. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=207.74s)]
*  We're about to show you some drone footage. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=209.56s)]
*  It aired on this show the night of August 31st, 2020. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=211.26000000000002s)]
*  At the time, we were interviewing a lawyer called John Pierce, who was then representing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=214.66000000000003s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  Take a look at the pictures on the right-hand side of your screen. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=219.4s)]
*  That's really a tertiary charge anyway, because there are other... [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=223.62s)]
*  Let me ask you about the first shooting of Joseph Rosenbaum. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=226.46s)]
*  The second two, one man was shot in the arm, the other was shot in the midsection and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=230.1s)]
*  died, both of them clearly, and that's obvious on video attacked Rittenhouse. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=234.22s)]
*  But the first shooting, was Rittenhouse fired upon before he fired? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  Did he believe he was fired upon? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=243.82s)]
*  What were the circumstances of that shooting? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  So that drone footage that you just saw, it's right there, that aired on this show, has [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=248.1s)]
*  become part of the Rittenhouse case. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=251.66s)]
*  Prosecutors claim that footage shows Kyle Rittenhouse raising his rifle in a provocative [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=254.18s)]
*  manner at an accused arsonist called Joshua Zeminski. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Now the footage doesn't actually show that, if you look at it carefully, but that's what [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=260.96s)]
*  they're claiming anyway. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  The prosecution's theory of the case is that Joseph Rosenbaum, the child rapist, began [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=265.24s)]
*  chasing Kyle Rittenhouse after Rittenhouse pointed his rifle at Zeminski. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=270.08s)]
*  So apparently the pedophile was defending the honor of the accused rapist. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=274.84s)]
*  That's their claim. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=278.0s)]
*  Conveniently for the state, however, Joshua Zeminski, like Maurice Freeland, never testified [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=279.68s)]
*  in this case. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=284.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=285.08s)]
*  Because the prosecutors made sure he couldn't. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=286.08s)]
*  Prosecutors charged Zeminski with arson and then delayed his trial so he would not be [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  available to testify in the Rittenhouse trial. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=291.28s)]
*  By the way, and this is relevant too, authorities say Zeminski brought a gun to the riot and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  fired a shot before Kyle Rittenhouse ever pulled his own trigger. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  How is that for relevant? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  But jurors never got to hear Joshua Zeminski explain that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  So here's the problem. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=308.96s)]
*  The drone footage we aired on this show was never provided to Kyle Rittenhouse's defense [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=310.32s)]
*  team. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=314.44s)]
*  They had a blurrier, lower grade copy of the tape. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=315.44s)]
*  Look at the images you're seeing on your screen right now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  You're seeing the high quality image on the bottom and the low quality image on the top. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=320.52s)]
*  There's no comparison between the two. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=325.48s)]
*  The defense had no way to analyze the high quality footage during the trial and provide [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=327.68s)]
*  it to their video experts. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=331.3s)]
*  They couldn't verify that the footage is accurate or make any arguments about what it shows. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=332.76s)]
*  They just had to accept the prosecution's version. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=336.72s)]
*  Now the defense only realized this after one of the prosecutors admitted it out loud, apparently [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=338.88s)]
*  by accident. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=344.16s)]
*  He admitted that his version of the drone footage was quote much clearer than the footage [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=345.16s)]
*  the defense had. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=350.88000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  This is the same quality as our version. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  Our version is much clearer. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=357.04s)]
*  According to one of Rittenhouse's lawyers, the defense copy of the drone footage was [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  nearly three times less clear than what the prosecutors had. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  I confirmed that this file that he said was directly provided to the state crime lab was [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=371.44s)]
*  an 11 millibit file, megabyte file, not four. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=377.68s)]
*  So the information contained in the flash drive was over double the size, almost three [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=381.16s)]
*  times the size as to what was emailed to me. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=387.38s)]
*  Every other piece of evidence from the state crime lab in this situation has been provided [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=390.76s)]
*  to us via Dropbox. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=395.28s)]
*  Dropbox provides an exact forensic copy of what they have. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=397.12s)]
*  The file title name in this situation should have been exactly the same as the one provided [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=402.72s)]
*  to the state if it was the exact same copy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  The file name was nowhere near similar. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=412.68s)]
*  So how to account for this? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=416.88s)]
*  Well the prosecutors explained they just got this footage the last minute, a few days ago. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=418.68s)]
*  They said they immediately sent it to the defense and they had no idea the defense would [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=423.54s)]
*  get such a low quality copy of it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=427.12s)]
*  It was a technical glitch, they said. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=428.94s)]
*  But that doesn't really make sense actually and the judge seemed to understand that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=430.54s)]
*  He asked why the prosecution waited more than a year to get this footage. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=434.7s)]
*  The defendant's first attorney after he was charged with this case appeared on a interview, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=439.96s)]
*  appeared alongside the high definition version of this footage. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=447.7s)]
*  If you know Tucker Carlson's got it, you could have subpoenaed it, no? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=451.42s)]
*  We didn't know that until I think today. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=455.66s)]
*  No, we knew it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=459.5s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the explanation is, there's no excuse for this in a criminal trial. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=462.42s)]
*  The prosecution has a legal obligation to obtain evidence in a timely manner and then [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=466.62s)]
*  provide it to the defense the moment it's available. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=471.02000000000004s)]
*  That's the law. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=473.42s)]
*  In this case, the prosecution waited until after the trial began to give the defense [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=474.72s)]
*  a low quality version of the drone footage. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=478.78s)]
*  So you have to ask, is this deliberate prosecutorial misconduct? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=480.82s)]
*  And actually, as a legal matter, it doesn't matter. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=484.9s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse is constitutionally entitled to see all the evidence against him at the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=487.46s)]
*  trial and he didn't. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=491.61999999999995s)]
*  So by definition, Kyle Rittenhouse is not getting a fair trial, by the way, outside [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=493.76s)]
*  the courtroom as well as inside. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=497.82s)]
*  Yesterday as hundreds of National Guard troops idled nearby, a fight broke out between protesters [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=500.02s)]
*  with an earshot of jurors. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=503.79999999999995s)]
*  Today we learned that a freelancer for MSNBC followed the jurors bus to the courtroom. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=506.1s)]
*  He blew through a red light to keep up with the bus. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=511.06s)]
*  Now why would he quote, journalists follow jurors before they've reached their verdict? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=513.86s)]
*  Well, the judge seemed to understand exactly what was going on. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=518.98s)]
*  This morning he banned anyone associated with MSNBC from the courthouse. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=523.0400000000001s)]
*  The police, when they stopped him because he was following in the distance of about [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=527.1800000000001s)]
*  and went through a red light, pulled him over and inquired of him what was going on and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=534.62s)]
*  he gave that information and stated that he had been instructed by Ms. Bayan in New York [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=540.02s)]
*  to follow the jury bus. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=548.3s)]
*  I have instructed that no one from MSNBC News will be permitted in this building for the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=551.94s)]
*  duration of this trial. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=557.98s)]
*  Now you don't have to like Kyle Rittenhouse or what he did to see this as scary and wrong [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=560.9s)]
*  and a threat to all of us. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=566.4399999999999s)]
*  Doesn't matter who you voted for, doesn't matter what you thought of Donald Trump. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=567.66s)]
*  That's irrelevant. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=570.78s)]
*  Withholding evidence in a criminal trial, intimidating jurors, these things threaten [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=572.18s)]
*  not just Kyle Rittenhouse, they threaten America's system of impartial justice, which by the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=577.14s)]
*  way is the best thing we still have in this country. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=581.02s)]
*  So what's interesting is who has no problem at all with any of this. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=584.8199999999999s)]
*  And we can't help but notice that the very same people who love pointless foreign wars [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=589.28s)]
*  and devastating drone attacks on civilian populations think that Kyle Rittenhouse should rot in [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=593.76s)]
*  prison. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=598.88s)]
*  Now watch this guest on CNN, one of the silliest dumbest people in public life, explain that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=600.24s)]
*  actually Rittenhouse's attempts to save his own life at a Biden rally filled with violent [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=604.72s)]
*  criminals was, quote, political violence. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=609.0s)]
*  I mean, I think we're in a frightening situation, Don, because I think what we're seeing is [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=611.92s)]
*  growing political violence. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=615.24s)]
*  You have Kyle Rittenhouse on trial right now for taking the law into his own hands and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=616.68s)]
*  shooting several people. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=621.2399999999999s)]
*  Remember, you had mass shootings during the Trump presidency at a Walmart in El Paso, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=622.52s)]
*  at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=627.12s)]
*  You had the storming of the Capitol with people who had gallows with them on January 6th. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=629.12s)]
*  And Republicans are really playing with fire. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  So you've got to wonder if people who talk like that, and there are an awful lot of them [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=637.92s)]
*  all of a sudden, believe what they say on television. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=641.04s)]
*  Did they watch the trial? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=644.92s)]
*  Did they understand the facts? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=646.36s)]
*  Do they even care what really happened that night in Kenosha? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=648.0s)]
*  Now we like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, even Max Boot, but honestly we're [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=651.12s)]
*  starting to wonder. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TqyR6gXgYg&t=655.76s)]
