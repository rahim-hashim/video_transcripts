# Tucker Carlson: Police officer reveals how force was unprepared for Jan 6
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA)
*  Many in federal law enforcement knew perfectly well there was going to be a huge demonstration in Washington on the afternoon of January 6, 2021, and that it could become potentially violent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=0.0s)]
*  There is no debate about that fact. The FBI knew. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=12.0s)]
*  But it's also clear that many on the U.S. Capitol Police Force, the frontline officers who protect the Congress, did not know. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=15.5s)]
*  They had no idea what was coming. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=22.7s)]
*  And because they didn't know, they were completely unprepared for what happened that day. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=24.8s)]
*  That is a very strange failure of communication, and it has never been explained. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=30.2s)]
*  To understand more about the response to January 6 inside the Capitol, we sat down with a man called Terrick Johnson. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=35.0s)]
*  Johnson served as a Capitol Hill police officer for 22 years. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=42.5s)]
*  On the day of the protests, he says he was responsible for securing the certification of the presidential election. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=46.8s)]
*  If there is anyone at the very heart of the January 6 story, it's former Capitol Police Lieutenant Terrick Johnson. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=53.6s)]
*  And yet, for some reason, the January 6 committee never called him to testify. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  My voice was one of the first ones you hear on the audio transmission. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=66.1s)]
*  So I did expect to get an interview at some time, but no, it didn't happen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=69.4s)]
*  I guess the focus was on Donald Trump. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=74.6s)]
*  According to Johnson, no one answered his numerous pleas for help over Capitol Police radio frequencies. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=78.5s)]
*  Johnson says he, quote, didn't hear anything on the radio. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=85.1s)]
*  According to Johnson, Yogananda Pittman kept vital information about the protests from frontline officers like him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=89.0s)]
*  Pittman was the assistant chief of the department in charge of intelligence operations. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=96.4s)]
*  We should have been better prepared that day, and we could have been better prepared that day if the information was disseminated like it was supposed to be. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=100.5s)]
*  Once protesters moved inside the building, Johnson's first concern was the safety of senators. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=108.4s)]
*  His job was to protect them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  In rising panic, he called over the radio for direction and assistance. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=115.2s)]
*  Even now, two years later, he is baffled by the response he got. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=119.4s)]
*  I was requesting permission to evacuate the Senate side, the Senate chambers, because I had a clear line of sight to get them out the Senate door, and I didn't get permission. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  The dispatcher called a couple of times to see if I can get permission, no response. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=134.2s)]
*  With Yogananda Pittman and his other supervisors unresponsive, Johnson says he decided to begin the evacuation of senators himself. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=139.0s)]
*  The person that I thought was going to authorize the evacuation didn't do it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=147.6s)]
*  I wanted to get those members of Congress out as quickly as I could. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=152.4s)]
*  That's why I initiated, you know, those evacuations. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=156.4s)]
*  For me, being disciplined, it wasn't as important as not getting the members of Congress and their staff to safety. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=160.4s)]
*  Footage we reviewed seems to bolster Johnson's account. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=167.4s)]
*  The video shows Johnson conducting the evacuation of senators from the chamber. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=170.8s)]
*  Yet Tark Johnson was not rewarded for what he did. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=175.4s)]
*  He was punished. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=178.4s)]
*  A photo emerged of Johnson wearing a MAGA hat outside the Capitol. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  That picture cost him his career. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=183.8s)]
*  Sometimes I look at it and like, thank you God for blessing me with this hat. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=186.0s)]
*  And sometimes I'm like, wow, I wish this hat never came in my life. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=190.5s)]
*  A Biden voter, Johnson says he donned the hat in an effort to rescue fellow officers he believed were trapped in the building. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=195.0s)]
*  I figured if I had the hat on, it would be easier for me to navigate my way through the crowd. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=202.2s)]
*  It was basically self-preservation and de-escalation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=206.0s)]
*  And I needed to get up those steps. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=210.8s)]
*  I couldn't say what would have happened walking through that crowd without it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=213.3s)]
*  But for the crime of wearing a Trump hat, Johnson found himself suspended. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  Ultimately, he resigned from the force and lost his pension. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=221.9s)]
*  He now works part time as a furniture mover. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  Yogananda Pittman, meanwhile, thrived. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=227.9s)]
*  Two days after January 6th, Nancy Pelosi elevated Pittman to acting chief of the Capitol Police. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  Late last year, Pittman took a high paying job as the head of security at UC Berkeley, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  which is right outside Pelosi's congressional district. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=242.6s)]
*  Berkeley announced Pittman's hiring with unqualified praise for her, quote, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  steadfast commitment to social justice. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=249.7s)]
*  Pittman herself boasted about her heroic performance on January 6th. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=252.5s)]
*  Her department, she said, quote, saved democracy that day. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=257.1s)]
*  We reached out to Yogananda Pittman for comment, but she didn't get back to us. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMmF-_iIQcA&t=261.3s)]
