# Marine hero stops smash-and-grab robbery at a jewelry store
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA)
*  All right, a few days before Christmas in Torrance, California, robbers tried to pull [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=0.0s)]
*  off a smash and grab robbery at a jewelry store inside a nearby recruiting station. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=3.4s)]
*  A Marine and an applicant, along with several bystanders, they heard the commotion and very [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=8.24s)]
*  quickly the group of good Samaritans detained the perpetrators. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=12.76s)]
*  Get them, homie. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=16.36s)]
*  Get them, homie. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=18.36s)]
*  Get them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=20.36s)]
*  Get them all, homie. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=22.36s)]
*  Get them all. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=24.36s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=26.36s)]
*  Salute. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=28.72s)]
*  That's right, homie. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=30.72s)]
*  Put it down for America. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=32.72s)]
*  Almost all the jewelry has been recovered. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=34.72s)]
*  One of the people who helped detain the robbers was Marine Staff Sergeant Jose Fragoso, and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=36.72s)]
*  he joins us now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=42.44s)]
*  Jose, good to see you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=43.44s)]
*  And I got to tell you what, fantastic video. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=44.44s)]
*  You and one of the applicants to the Marines stepped into gear. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=47.0s)]
*  Tell us what happened. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  So, what additionally happened is that I heard a bunch of glass breaking, and when I did, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=54.16s)]
*  the first response was to go check out Dennis' jewelry. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=60.16s)]
*  I know there were just two doors down. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=63.64s)]
*  I had to make sure everything was all right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=65.84s)]
*  As I approached the jewelry store, I saw four individuals that were robbing the store. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=67.92s)]
*  They had a sledgehammer there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=74.12s)]
*  Once they were coming out, I was able to apprehend one of the suspects. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=76.64s)]
*  With applicant in mind, I was able to apprehend another one. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=81.76s)]
*  Between a couple of us and bystanders, we actually were able to detain two of the four [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=84.68s)]
*  for the police to come by and just take them away. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=89.44s)]
*  Jose, I imagine that the criminals here didn't intend to meet Marines as they were trying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  to do the smash and grab. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Did they seem surprised that there was a group of you that were going to step into gear and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  stop this burglary in the process? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=104.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=106.84s)]
*  I don't think they definitely expected to have individuals in uniform stop them that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=107.92s)]
*  weren't police officers. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=112.72s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=114.2s)]
*  You had an applicant in your office at the time, you said, who was applying to join the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=115.56s)]
*  Marines. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  Has he been admitted? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=122.12s)]
*  What's his status right now? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=123.12s)]
*  Currently, he's still in the process, sir. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=124.44s)]
*  He's enlisting right now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=126.72s)]
*  We are currently just waiting on a couple of different things to continue his process, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=128.0s)]
*  but he definitely will be enlisting. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=131.52s)]
*  You said that in regard to the jewelry store, all the jewelry got back. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=133.72s)]
*  I think, if I got the story right, two of the criminals were apprehended by you guys, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=137.12s)]
*  but did two get away and were they later apprehended? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=142.24s)]
*  How did that work? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=144.4s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=145.4s)]
*  Two ended up getting away. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=146.4s)]
*  I'm not really sure about the background of it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=148.0s)]
*  I know we were able to detain two. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=150.84s)]
*  I'm not sure the police officer were able to take the other two as well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=152.32s)]
*  Your superiors, do they support you springing into action? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=157.56s)]
*  Sometimes, I'm not sure where the military goes on issues like this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=160.08s)]
*  Obviously, you're a recruiter, but also you're an American and a good Samaritan. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  You saw this happen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=166.92s)]
*  Are your superiors happy with what you've done? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=168.48s)]
*  Have you been commended for your action? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=171.2s)]
*  Yes, they were, sir. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=172.88s)]
*  They were absolutely very happy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=174.24s)]
*  They thanked me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  They said it's the Marine thing to do, to make sure we uphold our own values. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=177.28s)]
*  I can say what, it's always great to have Marines around. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=182.72s)]
*  I love in the video, they were yelling, Semper Fi, to you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=185.12s)]
*  It's like, all right, I got some family and support around as I'm stepping in and protecting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=188.24s)]
*  this business. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=192.4s)]
*  Staff Sergeant Jose Fragoso, thanks for joining me and thanks for your great bravery and thanks [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHU2EbQ5sVA&t=193.48000000000002s)]
