# Tucker: This could very easily get worse
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, you wonder if looking backward many years [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=2.54s)]
*  from right now, historians will notice [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=5.3s)]
*  the remarkable coincidence in timing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=7.38s)]
*  Have you noticed? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=11.02s)]
*  At exactly the moment when the emergency powers [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=12.22s)]
*  they awarded to themselves to fight COVID [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  started to wane, our leaders began pushing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=17.18s)]
*  for conflict with Russia. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=20.3s)]
*  And then on the basis of that conflict, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  they assumed historic war powers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=24.54s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=27.380000000000003s)]
*  Without even pausing, the Biden administration [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=28.220000000000002s)]
*  declared total economic war on a sovereign country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=30.14s)]
*  No American had been killed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=32.78s)]
*  The United States had not been invaded or attacked. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  And yet with no meaningful public debate [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=37.46s)]
*  or congressional authorization, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=39.38s)]
*  the Biden administration destroyed that country's currency [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=41.18s)]
*  then removed it from the international banking system [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=43.66s)]
*  that impoverished its population. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=45.74s)]
*  Then the administration began seizing the property [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=47.7s)]
*  of people affiliated with that country [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  without a trial or due process of any kind, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=52.22s)]
*  without even bothering to explain [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=55.08s)]
*  exactly what crime they had committed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=56.58s)]
*  No American government had ever done anything [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=59.8s)]
*  like that before. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  If there was one thing the US government long stood for, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=62.92s)]
*  it was the rule of law. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=65.8s)]
*  The integrity of the system was always [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=68.08s)]
*  the most important thing, but not anymore. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=70.38s)]
*  That turned out to be an era and that era is gone. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  Because the target is Russia, very few Americans [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=77.12s)]
*  have noticed any of this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=79.56s)]
*  They support it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=80.9s)]
*  Virtually no one has paused to ask him or herself [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=82.08s)]
*  where this might be going. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=84.6s)]
*  How long until our leaders do something similar [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=86.14s)]
*  to their domestic enemies here in the United States? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=88.14s)]
*  How long before they accuse you of collusion or disloyalty [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=90.62s)]
*  or some other hard to define crime, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=93.54s)]
*  declare you an enemy of the state [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=95.38000000000001s)]
*  and then confiscate your bank account? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=96.58000000000001s)]
*  Something very much like that just happened in Canada. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  We don't imagine it could happen here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  Mostly we just don't think about it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=103.18s)]
*  What we think about is Ukraine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  And that's the other thing that's changed. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=107.62s)]
*  The tech monopolies now exert a level of control [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=109.18s)]
*  over American public opinion [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=111.86000000000001s)]
*  that has no precedent in all of history. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=113.5s)]
*  Eliminating section 230 or whatever piddling reform [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=116.02s)]
*  Congress is talking about at the moment. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=119.28s)]
*  It all seems like a joke at this point. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=121.1s)]
*  It's too late. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=122.92s)]
*  The medieval church had less command [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  over society's emotions than Facebook [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=125.94s)]
*  and Google and Twitter now do. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  For the past two years, you have watched these companies [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=130.92s)]
*  above all define who you as an American must hate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=133.12s)]
*  Depending upon their directive of the day, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  our citizens dutifully changed their social media avatars [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=139.0s)]
*  from BLM signs to mask up slogans [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=141.84s)]
*  to now Ukrainian flags. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=144.4s)]
*  Each is a crisis and each new crisis [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=146.56s)]
*  is carefully stage managed from Silicon Valley [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=148.24s)]
*  at the direction of the White House. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=150.68s)]
*  How does the human brain compete with this? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=152.9s)]
*  How does it understand it? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=154.8s)]
*  Well, it doesn't. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Clarity and perspective become impossible. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  In the hysteria, even the recent past just evaporates. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=160.4s)]
*  The morning that Russia invaded Ukraine, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  you may have been talking about a lot of different things, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=166.28s)]
*  COVID or crime or the southern border. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=171.68s)]
*  Much to the leaf of the White House, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=173.02s)]
*  all of those topics have been forgotten, maybe forever. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  No population has ever been more skillfully manipulated [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=177.82000000000002s)]
*  than our population is being manipulated right now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=181.18s)]
*  But even with the tech monopolies on the case full time, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  there are limits. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  Some topics cannot be hidden and inflation is one of them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=188.46s)]
*  Google can delete all the search results it wants, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  but you still know what hamburger and gasoline costs [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=195.22s)]
*  because you go to the store. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  You know exactly how bad inflation is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=199.06s)]
*  And it's bad. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=202.22s)]
*  In fact, inflation is so high right now [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=203.3s)]
*  that even affluent people are worried about it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=205.5s)]
*  and not worried in some abstract sense [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=207.58s)]
*  like about the long-term health of the country, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=209.38s)]
*  though that too. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=211.26s)]
*  People who make 250 grand a year are worried [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=212.66s)]
*  they will not be able to continue living as they do now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=215.1s)]
*  You may or may not feel sorry for them, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=218.04s)]
*  but let's put it in perspective. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=220.52s)]
*  Imagine if you made 50 grand a year or 30 grand a year [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  as many Americans do. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  You would be terrified in the face of this inflation, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=227.04s)]
*  and maybe you are. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=230.2s)]
*  So what's causing it? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  What is the root of the inflation? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=233.56s)]
*  If you want to know the answer to that question, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=236.32s)]
*  the fastest way to get it is to check to see [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  what politicians are denying. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=240.18s)]
*  Whatever they claim is not the cause of inflation [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=242.16s)]
*  almost certainly is the cause of inflation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=244.76s)]
*  And with that in mind, here's Joe Biden telling you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=246.68s)]
*  that government spending has nothing to do with it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=248.84s)]
*  We're on track right now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=252.48s)]
*  I'm on track to be the first president in history [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=255.04s)]
*  to lower the deficit by over $1 trillion in one year. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=256.64s)]
*  So I'm sick of this stuff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=262.0s)]
*  We have to talk about it because the American people [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=265.0s)]
*  think the reason for inflation is government [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=267.14s)]
*  spending more money. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=268.8s)]
*  Simply not true. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  Now you can say, well, that's just Joe Biden. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=273.68s)]
*  Joe Biden's never had a real job. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=275.4s)]
*  Even before he became senile, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=276.86s)]
*  he was reputed to be a dim bulb, and he was. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  Don't kid yourself. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=281.24s)]
*  In the clip you just saw, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=282.68s)]
*  Joe Biden knows perfectly well he's lying. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=283.88s)]
*  It's simply not true, he squeaks. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=285.76s)]
*  Really, Joe Biden, how is it simply not true? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=287.8s)]
*  Notice he doesn't tell you how it's simply not true [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=290.52s)]
*  because in fact it is emphatically unequivocally true. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=292.56s)]
*  Inflation is a function of money supply. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=296.0s)]
*  The more money you have in circulation, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  the less that money is worth. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=300.92s)]
*  Even Joe Biden understands that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=302.68s)]
*  The month after Biden became president, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  the supply of US dollars in circulation [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=306.92s)]
*  increased more than it ever had before in a single month. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=308.96s)]
*  And then it kept going higher month after month after month [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=311.32s)]
*  as the administration and the Congress [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=314.56s)]
*  kept the money taps open. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=316.44s)]
*  And that's why we have historic inflation now, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=318.0s)]
*  because they printed too much money. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=320.1s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  But it's not the whole story. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=322.6s)]
*  It did not start with Joe Biden, to be fair. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=323.68s)]
*  In the months after the 2008 financial crisis, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=326.08s)]
*  the Fed Reserve assumed emergency powers [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=328.24s)]
*  to respond to the financial collapse. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=330.62s)]
*  Now if you're noticing a theme here, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=332.4s)]
*  the people in charge giving themselves emergency powers [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=333.88s)]
*  in the face of a crisis they created, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=336.7s)]
*  you may be on to something. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=338.4s)]
*  But in any case, after 2008, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=340.06s)]
*  the Fed dropped interest rates to near zero [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=341.36s)]
*  and then began printing money. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=343.44s)]
*  This was supposed to save our economy. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=344.64s)]
*  And maybe it would have saved the economy [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  if it had ended at some point, but it did not end. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=348.76s)]
*  It went on to the present day. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=352.08s)]
*  That's nearly 14 years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=353.8s)]
*  And in the process, what was designed to save our economy [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=355.56s)]
*  destroyed our economy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=359.4s)]
*  Several times over the years, wiser heads at the Fed [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=361.84s)]
*  talked about dropping the emergency measures [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=364.32s)]
*  and reintroducing reality into the American economy, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=366.38s)]
*  reintroducing market forces, remember those? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=369.24s)]
*  But each time they contemplated this, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=372.24s)]
*  Wall Street revolted in very public ways. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  Wage growth in the productive economy had stalled, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=377.24s)]
*  but the market for private jets was booming. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=379.48s)]
*  So asset inflation became the basis of wealth [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=382.16s)]
*  for many people at the top end. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=385.42s)]
*  Buy things, then sell them for more, make nothing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=387.32s)]
*  Now no society can continue like that for very long [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=390.92s)]
*  because it's not inherently productive, it's a shell game. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=393.36s)]
*  But ours did for more than 14 years. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=397.02s)]
*  And in the process, this country became more lopsided [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=399.86s)]
*  economically than it's ever been, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=402.66s)]
*  fewer people owning more of everything. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=403.98s)]
*  The Fed was fully aware of this, they're not stupid. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=407.24s)]
*  They knew they were causing these trends [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=409.3s)]
*  and that most of these trends were dangerous [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=411.42s)]
*  and bad for America, but the truth is nobody could stop it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=413.18s)]
*  Fed governors understood that markets would tank [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=417.44s)]
*  if they tried to pull back. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=419.66s)]
*  So it was really a classic Ponzi, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=421.76s)]
*  it was criminal mismanagement of our economy, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  but nobody could stop doing it [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=425.54s)]
*  for fear the whole thing would collapse. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=426.94s)]
*  And now we're at the end stage, the Fed is out of tricks. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=430.53999999999996s)]
*  The problem with inflation, and some economists [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=433.38s)]
*  want limited inflation at certain periods, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=435.46s)]
*  some people in Davos have been calling for it for years, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=437.97999999999996s)]
*  but the problem with inflation levels like this [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=440.58s)]
*  is there is no simple way to pull them back. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=443.06s)]
*  The Fed cannot painlessly massage its way [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=446.18s)]
*  out of $7 a gallon gas prices. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=448.38s)]
*  So when you reach a state as we are now, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=450.88s)]
*  you really have only two options. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=453.02s)]
*  You can pretend it's not happening [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=455.2s)]
*  or you can blame someone else for it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=457.5s)]
*  And the White House is trying both. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=460.34s)]
*  Here's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen trying the first. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=462.08s)]
*  We really protected most Americans [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=465.74s)]
*  from severe financial crisis consequences of the pandemic [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=468.7s)]
*  so that they're by and large in good financial shape, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=474.16s)]
*  poised to spend enough to continue propelling [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=480.22s)]
*  solid growth in the US economy. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=484.26s)]
*  And we're seeing that in the labor market. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=486.94s)]
*  Now you wonder as you stare into a camera [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=490.78s)]
*  and say something like that, if you imagine, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=493.14s)]
*  if you can convince yourself there's a single human being [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=495.66s)]
*  who believes you, things are great. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=498.04s)]
*  You should be grateful for our wise stewardship [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=499.34s)]
*  of your economy. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=501.26s)]
*  Keep in mind the woman who's heard, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=503.46s)]
*  Janet Yellen was the chair of the Federal Reserve [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=504.58s)]
*  for four years. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=507.04s)]
*  So not to be technical about it, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=509.18s)]
*  but if anyone is culpable for the disaster [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=510.58s)]
*  we're living through now, it would be Janet Yellen. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=512.42s)]
*  So she knows she's lying. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=514.42s)]
*  And she's not even lying very effectively [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=516.3399999999999s)]
*  because once again, Americans understand [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=517.8599999999999s)]
*  the state of the economy because they live within it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=520.5799999999999s)]
*  They pay for things. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=523.06s)]
*  So if you're gonna lie about its cause, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=524.7199999999999s)]
*  you're gonna have to do better [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=526.4799999999999s)]
*  than just pretending it's not going on. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=527.5s)]
*  You're gonna have to blame somebody else. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=529.3s)]
*  And so the White House enlisted Joe Biden's publicist [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=531.26s)]
*  to make a video about Vladimir Putin. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=533.8599999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=536.5799999999999s)]
*  You may have noticed this week [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=537.9799999999999s)]
*  that your gas prices have gone up. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=539.3s)]
*  I wanna talk to you a little bit about why. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=541.18s)]
*  A lot of it has to do with Vladimir Putin. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=543.3s)]
*  And there's opportunities to produce more from here. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=545.38s)]
*  But part of this is on the oil companies. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=548.06s)]
*  Right now there are 9,000 approved unused permits [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=550.06s)]
*  that oil and gas companies could tap into now [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=554.26s)]
*  to ramp up production. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=557.06s)]
*  That's why the president has been so focused [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=558.9s)]
*  on investing in clean energy technologies [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=560.98s)]
*  so that we can rely on that and not President Putin [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=563.38s)]
*  to set the price of gas. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=566.54s)]
*  I wanna talk to you a little bit about why that's happening. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=569.06s)]
*  What do you work at NPR now? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=571.14s)]
*  You don't know anything. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=572.22s)]
*  You are a publicist. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=574.14s)]
*  Please stay in your lane. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=576.3s)]
*  But she's telling us that actually oil companies, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=578.78s)]
*  which we assume were very greedy [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=581.9399999999999s)]
*  and that was the problem with them, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=583.58s)]
*  in fact don't wanna make money. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=585.14s)]
*  That's their real secret. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=587.62s)]
*  And that's why they're not drilling for oil anymore [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=588.86s)]
*  because they just don't want the oil [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=590.86s)]
*  because they're oil companies [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=593.62s)]
*  and they're altruistic or something. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  She must've learned that in gender studies class at Oberlin. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=597.3s)]
*  Now she's telling the rest of us. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=599.34s)]
*  But really, Jen Psaki said, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=600.66s)]
*  it's about Vladimir Putin. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=603.06s)]
*  It's Vladimir Putin's fault that you're paying more for gas. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=605.02s)]
*  Now the truth is Vladimir Putin did invade Ukraine. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=607.8199999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=610.8199999999999s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=612.18s)]
*  But that's not why you can't afford to fill your tank. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=613.66s)]
*  It was the White House and we should say [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=617.78s)]
*  the Congress's reaction to the invasion [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=620.06s)]
*  that is ruling our economy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=622.8199999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=624.42s)]
*  So among many other things, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=625.6999999999999s)]
*  the White House just banned Russian oil imports. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=626.8199999999999s)]
*  For example, oil prices immediately rose. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=628.9s)]
*  That's what happens when you shake up a market like that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=631.02s)]
*  Americans immediately suffered. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=633.26s)]
*  We were told, many people told us, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=635.02s)]
*  it's worth it because this is a moral victory against Putin. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=637.5s)]
*  And some people took solace in this. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=641.54s)]
*  But you have to wonder how exactly [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=643.98s)]
*  is this a moral victory against Putin? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=645.5799999999999s)]
*  Think about it for a minute. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=647.98s)]
*  Russia is a major oil producer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=649.38s)]
*  Jen Psaki said that in her interminable video a moment ago. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=651.6999999999999s)]
*  That would mean that higher oil prices help Putin. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=655.14s)]
*  They make Putin and the Saudis and the Venezuelans and Iran [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=659.78s)]
*  much, much richer. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=664.1s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=665.74s)]
*  Because Russia can still sell its oil in global markets. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=666.6999999999999s)]
*  Because the world has not joined our boycott. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=669.66s)]
*  What does this tell you? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=673.22s)]
*  It tells you that the loser in this policy [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=674.62s)]
*  is not Vladimir Putin. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=677.5s)]
*  He's the winner. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=678.9s)]
*  It's the United States. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=681.1s)]
*  And it's not just oil. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=682.98s)]
*  Thanks to the Biden administration's mismanagement, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=685.3s)]
*  commodities across the board are up dramatically. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=687.3s)]
*  Potash, fertilizers, wheat, huge. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=689.7s)]
*  Nickel went up 250% in two days. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=692.0600000000001s)]
*  Who's going to pay for all this? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=695.62s)]
*  You are. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=696.82s)]
*  This is the biggest tax increase of your life. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=698.5400000000001s)]
*  And by the way, it could very easily get worse. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=701.74s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=704.0600000000001s)]
*  Because oil is traded in US dollars. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=705.3000000000001s)]
*  Ever hear the term petrodollars? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=707.7s)]
*  Why would the rest of the world continue [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=710.6600000000001s)]
*  to trade oil in US dollars, a fact that greatly benefits us, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  when there's uncertainty imposed by political forces [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=717.46s)]
*  on oil markets? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=720.4200000000001s)]
*  There would be a huge incentive to trade oil in another [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=721.7s)]
*  currency, maybe the Chinese currency, maybe the euro, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=724.9000000000001s)]
*  maybe crypto, who knows? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=727.1s)]
*  But there will be new and competing markets [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=728.62s)]
*  in which oil is traded in something other than US dollars. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=731.3000000000001s)]
*  And that's a massive loss for us. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=734.5400000000001s)]
*  Here's the bigger truth. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=736.5s)]
*  Our global financial systems benefit us. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=738.38s)]
*  That may not be fair, but it's true. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=741.5s)]
*  And they're the basis of our wealth. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=743.14s)]
*  So if you destroy them in an effort to get Putin, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=745.14s)]
*  who are you really destroying? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=748.5s)]
*  You're destroying the United States. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=750.22s)]
*  And that's exactly what they've done. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=751.9s)]
*  When you attack and destabilize the global financial systems [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=754.18s)]
*  to restate, you're attacking and destabilizing the United [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=757.22s)]
*  States, not Putin. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=760.8199999999999s)]
*  You can't see this right now because there's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=763.3s)]
*  so much hysteria being ginned up by the media, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=765.1s)]
*  particularly on social media. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=767.34s)]
*  But when that hysteria lifts, when the cloud finally [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=769.22s)]
*  evaporates, it will be obvious that the Biden [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=772.06s)]
*  administration's response to the invasion of Ukraine [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=774.5s)]
*  is the single most damaging thing any American president [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=776.98s)]
*  has ever done to this country and to the world. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=779.62s)]
*  Not to Putin, to us and to a lot of small countries [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=782.5s)]
*  that didn't deserve it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=785.58s)]
*  It's hard to see that now. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=787.38s)]
*  All you're seeing are Ukrainian flag emojis on Twitter. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=788.46s)]
*  But someday we will assess this moment with clear heads. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=791.1800000000001s)]
*  And when we do, we will be horrified. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4-vqO0oQ4&t=793.86s)]
