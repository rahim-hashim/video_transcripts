# Tucker: People are sick of hearing this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 03, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo)
*  It seems like the perfect moment to rethink what we thought we knew about American politics, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=0.0s)]
*  the way the country runs, in the laundry list of lies that we have been force-fed for the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  past year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=10.5s)]
*  Now is the moment, because clearly we're at an inflection point. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=12.34s)]
*  Last night, if you were to sum it up in a single phrase, we've had enough. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=15.58s)]
*  There's a limit to which you can push the American population before they gently and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=19.68s)]
*  politely push back through democratic means. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=23.6s)]
*  And that's exactly what we just saw. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=25.44s)]
*  It is now impossible to deny that this country is in the middle of some kind of political [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=27.96s)]
*  realignment and the people who run our country did not see it coming. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=32.16s)]
*  There are a lot of examples here, the obvious ones and the not so obvious. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=36.08s)]
*  Let's just start with the latter. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=39.08s)]
*  In Texas last night, Republicans just flipped an overwhelmingly Hispanic district, one that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=40.8s)]
*  went for Joe Biden, by 14 points a year ago. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=44.56s)]
*  14 points. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=49.04s)]
*  Because of course Hispanic districts go Democrat because Hispanics are Democrats, right? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=50.6s)]
*  Well, the Republican in that district, John Lujan, won, and he won by calling for the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=55.6s)]
*  one thing you're not allowed to call for in an overwhelmingly Hispanic district, border [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=60.0s)]
*  security. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Countries have borders. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Everybody understands that, no matter what color they are, it turns out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=66.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, in a place that looks very different from the southern parts of Texas, Minneapolis, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=69.24s)]
*  really the cradle of anxious white liberalism, the place that defund the police first sounded [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  like a good idea. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=79.92s)]
*  In Minneapolis, voters overwhelmingly rejected a measure to defund their own police and get [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=81.0s)]
*  rid of their police department. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=86.6s)]
*  Turns out we need police, even in Minneapolis that's dawned on them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=87.6s)]
*  And then in the state of New Jersey, a truck driver who spent a total of $150 on his campaign [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=91.28s)]
*  is, as of right now, beating the longtime president of the New Jersey State Senate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=96.92s)]
*  And it's not mindlessly populist to suggest he'll probably be better, actually. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=102.12s)]
*  But the headline is the party that is calling for firing truck drivers is suddenly losing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=107.72s)]
*  elections to truck drivers. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=111.92s)]
*  And if that's not sweet, we don't know what the word means. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=113.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, the governor of that state, the self-appointed king of New Jersey, the finance [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=117.24s)]
*  goon Phil Murphy, was of course going to win his race by some massive margin. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=122.0s)]
*  It's New Jersey. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=126.88s)]
*  It's a machine state. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=128.46s)]
*  Joe Biden won it by 16 points a year ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=130.16s)]
*  But that's not what happened. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=133.2s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=134.48s)]
*  Instead, Phil Murphy apparently barely made it across the finish line. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=135.72s)]
*  That's not even totally settled. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  But as of right now, Murphy's margin of victory is less than 1%. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=142.04s)]
*  Does he see that as an endorsement of his policies? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=145.68s)]
*  Good job, Phil Murphy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=148.0s)]
*  Winning by less than 1% in New Jersey? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=150.24s)]
*  No, he probably does. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=152.28s)]
*  That's how deluded these people are. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=153.72s)]
*  But here's the headline, as you're certainly aware by now, and it's the Commonwealth of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=155.98s)]
*  Virginia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=159.16s)]
*  It's Glenn Youngkin, a man you had not heard of last year. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=160.16s)]
*  Ten months ago, Glenn Youngkin's name recognition was 2%. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=163.68s)]
*  If you didn't live next to Glenn Youngkin, you'd not heard of him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  He ran against the former governor of Virginia, who was governor just four years ago, one [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=171.12s)]
*  of the most famous people in the Democratic Party for 30 years, Bill Clinton's best friend, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=175.52s)]
*  Terry McAuliffe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=179.52s)]
*  And he spanked him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=180.52s)]
*  How did he do that exactly? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=182.72s)]
*  Well, a lot of ways, and we're going to talk about them tonight, but here's one interesting [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=183.72s)]
*  slice of the demographic pie. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=187.38s)]
*  Fox News has found that Hispanics voted for Glenn Youngkin by a nine-point margin. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=188.8s)]
*  Well, that's odd because the entire campaign against Glenn Youngkin was based on the idea [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=194.36s)]
*  he was a racist. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  It turns out normal people don't believe that, and they're sick of hearing it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  In her victory speech, the new lieutenant governor of Virginia, the woman who ran with [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Glenn Youngkin, her name is Winsome Sears, made this point. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=209.12s)]
*  This is the essential point. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=213.66000000000003s)]
*  And it's clear that most Americans, very clear tonight, agree with it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=215.96s)]
*  This is not a racist country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=219.28s)]
*  Stop telling us that it is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=221.76s)]
*  Stop lecturing us. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=223.56s)]
*  Improve our lives. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=225.04s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=226.24s)]
*  There are some who want to divide us, and we must not let that happen. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=227.24s)]
*  They would like us to believe we are back in 1963 when my father came. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=233.48s)]
*  We can live where we want. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=240.28s)]
*  We can eat where we want. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  We own the water fountains. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=243.56s)]
*  We have had a black president elected not once but twice, and here I am living proof. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=246.68s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  Nicely put, nicely illustrated. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=256.4s)]
*  Stop it, Democratic propaganda machine, NBC News, the Atlantic, the White House. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=259.48s)]
*  Stop lying to us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=264.96s)]
*  Stop picking the scab. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=265.96s)]
*  Stop trying to divide us by how we look. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=267.48s)]
*  That was the core message that the voters in Virginia sent last night. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=270.42s)]
*  The question is, will Washington manage to decipher what they have said? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=273.86s)]
*  And unfortunately, the odds of that are not great. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=277.7s)]
*  Remember that on his final night of this bitterly fought campaign, Terry McAuliffe, who knows [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=280.18s)]
*  his way around politics, brought in someone called Randy Weingarten to speak on his behalf [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  on stage. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=289.38s)]
*  Yes, Randy Weingarten, a repulsive teachers union hack from New York who has precisely [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=290.38s)]
*  no interest in or connection to the voters of Virginia. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  So what's the message of that? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=299.82s)]
*  The message is really clear. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=300.82s)]
*  We don't care about you at all. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  You play no role in this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=304.48s)]
*  This is an inside game. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=305.72s)]
*  And of course, they mean it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=307.58s)]
*  They really feel that way. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=308.58s)]
*  They think it's how they win through coalitions. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=310.26s)]
*  You're not part of it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  You see this in everything they do. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=314.72s)]
*  Here's a senile president and a VP no one likes. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=316.26s)]
*  Deal with it, America. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=318.8s)]
*  In the case of Virginia, just six weeks ago, a low IQ Washington Post columnist called [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=321.02s)]
*  Jennifer Rubin assured us that an endorsement from some has-been-functionary in Dan Quayle's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  office from the 1980s was going to make all the difference for Terry McAuliffe. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  Quote, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=335.06s)]
*  The Bill Kristol endorsement will be big, Rubin announced naturally on Twitter. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=336.06s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  It's hard to believe that's real, but it's entirely real. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=342.5s)]
*  And it's exactly why they lost last night. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGzZhbHeAo&t=346.4s)]
