# Dana White: COVID was the 'scariest thing' to happen in my life
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU)
*  So we were at Las Vegas last week to meet and interview the president of the USC, UFC, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=0.0s)]
*  Dana White, and we're not exactly sure what to expect. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=10.68s)]
*  We were highly impressed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=14.0s)]
*  It turns out that his experiences over the past several years are very similar to the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=15.64s)]
*  experiences of millions of business owners in this country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=19.76s)]
*  The difference is he found a way to keep going. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=22.44s)]
*  He told us that during the COVID lockdowns, the government tried to shut him down completely [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=25.64s)]
*  and of course, the media were intent on helping the government do that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=30.0s)]
*  CBS, for example, reported that, quote, Dana White is an epidemic on his hands. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=33.24s)]
*  The Washington Post reported that, quote, epidemiologists blast UFC President Dana White. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=38.36s)]
*  Of course, there was never any evidence that Dana White had in any way contributed to the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  pandemic. It was all a lie. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=48.44s)]
*  So the point of the story, however, is that Dana White kept UFC alive during the lockdowns. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  He did not bow to pressure. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=57.0s)]
*  He persisted, didn't lay off a single person. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=59.04s)]
*  It's an inspiring story. Here's part of it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=61.36s)]
*  Dana White, thank you for having us. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=64.92s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=66.4s)]
*  Never done an interview with human blood on the floor. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=66.88s)]
*  And I like it. So the first thing I noticed, having watched a lot of UFC, is how small [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=69.76s)]
*  this is, the Octagon, in real life. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=74.52s)]
*  There is no place to run. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=77.2s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a smaller version of it that we use here at the Apex. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=78.76s)]
*  But when we go into arenas, we use a bigger one. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=83.16s)]
*  This would look like a like a matchbox in some of the arenas that we go to. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  The one that they fight in on pay-per-view in arenas is much bigger. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=90.0s)]
*  What do the fighters think of being locked in a space this small? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=93.96s)]
*  It's funny because we used to talk about, you know, fights are probably more exciting [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=97.28s)]
*  and more there's more engagement in a smaller Octagon, but it's not true. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=101.44s)]
*  We actually did studies on it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=104.84s)]
*  And there are just as many finishes in the big one as there are in the small one. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=106.44s)]
*  Interesting. So this is your arena where a lot of your fights take place. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  In your building, in a world you completely control. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=116.08s)]
*  100 percent. So this, ironically, was built. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=119.24s)]
*  We were literally put in the last nails and screws in this place right when Covid hit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  So it couldn't have been more perfect if we were actually allowed to use the arena [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=128.04s)]
*  because they shut Nevada down and, you know, we couldn't even do it [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=132.84s)]
*  in our own facility that we controlled and that we could have created a bubble here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=137.64s)]
*  But they, you know, the government wouldn't let us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=141.76s)]
*  So you're in the sports business. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  And I should say you're really the only figure left in American sports who controls the sport. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=146.48s)]
*  I mean, you're in charge of the sport. Right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=150.76s)]
*  So that's not a model that exists anywhere else. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  But you're responsible for the sport. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=154.6s)]
*  And now you can't have in-person events. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=156.11999999999998s)]
*  What where does that leave you at the beginning of Covid? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was tough. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=161.88s)]
*  You know, I say it all the time. Covid is the was the toughest thing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  I've ever had to navigate in the history of this company. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  And if you look at where we came from, that's actually saying something. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=169.88s)]
*  But my attitude and my thought process was this is America. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=173.56s)]
*  We don't quit. We don't give up. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=178.4s)]
*  And we definitely don't run and hide in our houses. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=180.28s)]
*  So I figured there had to be a way. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=183.28s)]
*  So Covid happens. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=186.16s)]
*  Companies start laying off big percentage of the workforce. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  They don't know how long the quarantines are going to remain in effect. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=190.6s)]
*  They're indefinite. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=193.32s)]
*  And they've got these payrolls they have to meet. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=194.68s)]
*  You did not lay people off. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=196.76s)]
*  No. My people, a lot of my people around here have been with me [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=198.56s)]
*  for a long time, 10 to 20 years. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=202.0s)]
*  And, you know, we do events every weekend. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=205.04s)]
*  These people work hard. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=207.84s)]
*  They've been dedicated to this company, to me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=209.08s)]
*  And, you know, if you look at Covid, it's probably the scariest thing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=212.56s)]
*  to ever happen in the history of my life. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=215.72s)]
*  And to all of a sudden just dump my employees [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=218.24s)]
*  the minute something bad happens, it's just not the way that I'm built. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=223.68s)]
*  It wasn't going to happen no matter what. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=226.48s)]
*  I'd rather have seen the whole company [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=228.24s)]
*  burn and go down in flames before I would hurt my employees. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  So you paid everybody? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=234.67999999999998s)]
*  Paid everybody. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=235.76s)]
*  So that introduces a math problem, though, into your life, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  because you've got a lot of money going out, no money coming in. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=240.64s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=242.92s)]
*  Figure out how to put on events. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  You figure out how to how to keep the show alive and keep it going. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  At the time, you know, I'm close to the royal family in Abu Dhabi, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=250.83999999999997s)]
*  and they were doing testing over there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  If they were doing testing, we could do testing here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=257.88s)]
*  It was just a matter of figuring out how to do it and figuring out [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=260.67999999999995s)]
*  a place where we could go, where we could build a true bubble [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=264.76s)]
*  and make sure that people were safe and put on events. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=268.08s)]
*  So you went to Abu Dhabi. Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  So originally we were looking for an island. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=272.84s)]
*  Islands made sense. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  Mike Tyson called me and had some guys. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=276.64s)]
*  I don't remember what island it was that said, you can come to our island [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=279.44s)]
*  and do the fights. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=283.32s)]
*  There was literally no private. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  There was no infrastructure there, no nothing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=287.0s)]
*  So that was out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=289.64s)]
*  And then we ended up talking to Abu Dhabi and they suggested [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=291.32s)]
*  Yaz Island in Abu Dhabi. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=295.44s)]
*  And it was really the only true bubble that existed in sports [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=297.32s)]
*  because they brought people in. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=301.4s)]
*  There were workers, the workers in the hotel, the workers in the restaurant. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=303.24s)]
*  All the people that were at Yaz Island were tested before they went there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=306.4s)]
*  And they were there for weeks being tested regularly before we even got there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=310.32s)]
*  Then the people that we were bringing over, we tested, flew over [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=315.0s)]
*  on our own private plane that only we were on, got to the island. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=319.32s)]
*  We were tested again and tested multiple times up until the event happened. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=323.28s)]
*  And then everybody would go home. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=327.4s)]
*  So it was the only true bubble that really existed. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=329.08s)]
*  So that allowed you to keep your sport on the air when everything else was shut down. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=331.67999999999995s)]
*  Right. Why didn't everyone else do that? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=340.12s)]
*  You know what? I took a lot of heat. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=342.28s)]
*  Took a lot of bullets. Took a lot of and look around criticism. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=344.52s)]
*  That's what the media does. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=349.68s)]
*  Media does nothing. They never built anything. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=351.44s)]
*  Nobody depends on them for a paycheck. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=355.0s)]
*  But all they do is sit back and criticize. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=357.24s)]
*  I'm going to kill people. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  I care more about money than I do human life. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  I heard it all. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=364.88s)]
*  And the New York Times, as you can imagine, was blasting me daily [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  because you were trying to keep your employees paid and fed [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=370.88s)]
*  and keep your business going. Right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=374.08s)]
*  Because you're trying to figure out solutions to problems. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=375.28s)]
*  You're trying to, you know, everybody felt like it was this narrative [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  during Covid that if you didn't run and hide, you were reckless. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  You were a monster. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=387.28s)]
*  You didn't care about other people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=388.76s)]
*  And the list goes on and on. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=390.91999999999996s)]
*  So how did you take that criticism? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=392.24s)]
*  They were working. Good fun. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  They're writing stories every day. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=397.4s)]
*  These guys have nothing to worry about. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  They're writing horror stories every day. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=401.24s)]
*  And they were all working. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=403.36s)]
*  But how did you keep that out of your head? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=405.0s)]
*  I mean, it's easy to say I don't care about criticism. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=407.08s)]
*  But when you are criticized like that in the New York Times, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=409.04s)]
*  the biggest newspaper in the world, it's hard to keep it out of your head. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=411.0s)]
*  It really wasn't. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=414.72s)]
*  You know, I live in like my own little world over here in our own little bubble. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=416.12s)]
*  And I knew that if I went and I figured out a way to do it, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=420.08s)]
*  that my team would go with me. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=424.32s)]
*  And I knew that the fighters would fight. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  So as long as we were all aligned and everybody felt the same way. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=428.8s)]
*  And, you know, we weren't 100 percent aligned. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=431.92s)]
*  There were some fighters that were scared and a little nervous. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=434.56s)]
*  And they didn't have to fight if they didn't want to. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=437.2s)]
*  Nobody was being forced to fight. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=439.12s)]
*  If you wanted to fight, you could, because that's how these guys [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=440.76s)]
*  feed their families, too, and how, you know. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=443.6s)]
*  So, yeah, I kept everybody working. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=446.0s)]
*  Was there any. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=448.56s)]
*  COVID death around you, I mean, the New York Times said you're killing people, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=451.36s)]
*  did you? There was no COVID death. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=454.68s)]
*  You know, there were people who caught COVID, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  and I was sending out weekly videos to my employees. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=458.48s)]
*  Listen, enjoy this time that you have with your families. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=461.55999999999995s)]
*  Relax. If you get COVID or anybody you care about gets COVID, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  make me your first call and we'll get you taken care of. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=469.96s)]
*  We'll get you looked at. If you need toilet paper, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  toilet paper was a big deal at that time. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=475.55999999999995s)]
*  We'll get you toilet paper. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  If you need food and you can't get groceries or you need anything. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  Call us and we'll take care of you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=482.84s)]
*  Through COVID, me and my team became stronger than we've ever been. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=484.35999999999996s)]
*  And then once we it was time to get back to work. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=488.84s)]
*  I mean, there's still companies today that people aren't back to work yet. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  My whole team has been back to work like maybe like three, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  four weeks into the beginning of the pandemic. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=499.15999999999997s)]
*  Did we work straight through this whole time? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=502.55999999999995s)]
*  Did you lose anyone? We didn't lose anyone. No, we didn't lose anyone. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=505.0s)]
*  So you were loyal to your employees and you never had staff problems. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=508.55999999999995s)]
*  100 percent. I was loyal to my employees. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=512.48s)]
*  My employees were loyal to me for the last 20 years. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=514.24s)]
*  Then when when the hit the fan, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=518.04s)]
*  I was very loyal to my people and they were loyal back. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  And we've gotten through this thing. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=524.24s)]
*  We threw one hell of a Christmas party last year and we had a blast [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=527.0s)]
*  and we partied and had fun and we brought Kid Rock in. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=529.88s)]
*  Kid Rock came and played. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=533.48s)]
*  No, I. Kid Rock came and played for everybody. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=534.48s)]
*  And it's almost like it never even happened here. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=537.48s)]
*  So you're basically showing the rest of the country [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=541.08s)]
*  how to stare down adversity and achieve and thrive despite it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=544.76s)]
*  It was a pretty impressive story. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=551.0s)]
*  Did any politicians call you to say, I'm really impressed by what you're doing? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=552.72s)]
*  You know, the president at the time did, you know, obviously he was very into it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=558.72s)]
*  You know, Florida was was massive for us. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=564.92s)]
*  You know, Florida, I would I would equate Florida to Abu Dhabi. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=570.6s)]
*  During these times, it's what did Florida do? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=574.76s)]
*  You know, the governor, Governor DeSantis and the mayor of Jacksonville, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=577.8s)]
*  Florida, told us, come on in, we'll host you here. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=582.64s)]
*  You can do your events here. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=585.92s)]
*  I have fighters from all over the world. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=588.16s)]
*  So the fighters that were from other countries, we all brought into Abu Dhabi. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=590.36s)]
*  All the Americans we fought down in Jacksonville, Florida. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=594.8s)]
*  So we were still able to run our business. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=598.0s)]
*  Like nothing was even going on other than we didn't have fans. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=601.24s)]
*  We didn't have a live gate because of them. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=604.16s)]
*  Then Tillman for Tita down in Houston was saying, I need you here in my arena in Houston. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  How quick can you get here? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=613.64s)]
*  So it'll be there as soon as your your mayor lets me, you know. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=615.8s)]
*  So we figured out a date and then then it became Houston, Texas, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=619.4s)]
*  Jacksonville, Florida and Abu Dhabi. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=624.52s)]
*  These are the stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=634.16s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHFCStd1jU&t=637.0s)]
