# Lia Thomas' NCAA Woman of the Year nomination is a 'slap to the face' for female swimmers: Gaines
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s)
*  So William Thomas was a college swimmer. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=1.0s)]
*  He was pretty good. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=3.04s)]
*  Then he decided, pretty smart, to identify as a woman [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=4.0s)]
*  and he became great. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Not a scam or anything. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=10.32s)]
*  And now he's been nominated by University of Pennsylvania, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=11.64s)]
*  which is sort of an Ivy League school, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=14.24s)]
*  as the quote, NCAA Woman of the Year. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=15.96s)]
*  So here you have a man competing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=19.64s)]
*  in women's swimming competitions [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=21.0s)]
*  and getting awarded for it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=23.0s)]
*  Now Riley Gaines also competes [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=25.88s)]
*  for the University of Kentucky as a swimmer. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=27.6s)]
*  She is a woman. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=29.44s)]
*  She's also been nominated to be the NCAA Woman of the Year. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=30.32s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=33.56s)]
*  Riley, thanks so much for coming up. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=34.68s)]
*  Would it just be easier to identify as an eighth grader [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=36.24s)]
*  and just dominate kids swimming? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=38.6s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=41.72s)]
*  That sounds about like how it's going, doesn't it? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=42.56s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=45.52s)]
*  I'm sorry to make fun of it, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  but I don't know what else to say. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=49.74s)]
*  You've been nominated. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=50.58s)]
*  But that's what it is. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=51.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=53.24s)]
*  It's a mockery. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=54.06s)]
*  That's what this whole thing has turned into. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  Something we've, as female athletes, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=57.46s)]
*  dedicated our whole lives to. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=59.22s)]
*  It's something that people are laughing at. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=61.18s)]
*  It's an insult. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=64.12s)]
*  It's incredibly disheartening. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  And quite frankly, it's wrong. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=66.62s)]
*  Well, especially since swimming is, I ask any swimmer, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=69.34s)]
*  it's gotta be the most painful of all sports. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=72.1s)]
*  I mean, pain tolerance is one of the key qualifications [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=74.38s)]
*  for collegiate swimming, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=76.82s)]
*  The ability to endure a lot of suffering in the pool. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=77.82s)]
*  So you spent years enduring this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=80.34s)]
*  and some guy jumps ahead of you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=82.66s)]
*  I mean, are you bitter about it? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=84.48s)]
*  I mean, we have an NCAA woman of the year [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=87.14s)]
*  who spent 95% of their life as a male. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=90.26s)]
*  That just, it doesn't add up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=93.66s)]
*  It's incredibly just insulting. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=95.86s)]
*  Think of all the athletes at UPenn, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=99.42s)]
*  the deserving female athletes [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=100.98s)]
*  who did not get this nomination. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=102.5s)]
*  And Thomas did after quite literally only one year. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=104.06s)]
*  Woman of the year. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=107.38s)]
*  It makes sense because it's been one year [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=108.22s)]
*  Thomas has spent as a female. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=110.38s)]
*  And so yeah, it's insulting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=114.08s)]
*  It's a punch in the gut. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=115.62s)]
*  It's a slap to the face and it's a total regression [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=117.06s)]
*  of what Title IX stands for. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=120.06s)]
*  And ironically enough, I brought this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=122.26s)]
*  It's a letter I got from the NCAA today. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=124.58s)]
*  I got it actually as I was walking out of the door [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=127.38s)]
*  to come to the studio, but I picked it up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=128.96s)]
*  It says that this award is rooted in Title IX. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=132.1s)]
*  I'll just pause there for a second. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=136.5s)]
*  It's rooted in Title IX. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=139.96s)]
*  And as the 50th anniversary of Title IX, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=141.22s)]
*  this year's NCAA woman of the year award [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=143.62s)]
*  provides an important opportunity to honor incredible women [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=146.58s)]
*  and reflect on the impact of women [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=150.02s)]
*  on intercollegiate sports. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=152.62s)]
*  And I just read this and honestly, like you said, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=154.66s)]
*  I just laughed because that's what we're doing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=156.78s)]
*  at this point is laughing at women. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=159.38s)]
*  It's funny because obviously the University of Pennsylvania [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=162.06s)]
*  is a joke and has been for a while. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=164.5s)]
*  Most people don't know that yet. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  Do you find it interesting that Kentucky, where you go, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=168.3s)]
*  has taken a stand for biology where this quote, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=172.1s)]
*  Ivy League school is taking a stand against biology? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=174.46s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=179.7s)]
*  I think it says something about the Southeastern Conference. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=180.54s)]
*  It says a lot obviously about the Ivy League, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  but for them to nominate me, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=187.54s)]
*  obviously at the University of Kentucky, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=188.82s)]
*  we have amazing female athletes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=190.28s)]
*  We have Abby Steiner, who's a US champion. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=192.66s)]
*  We have Ryan Howard, who's the number one WNBA draft pick. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=194.78s)]
*  And so I don't wanna say I feel undeserving [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=198.22s)]
*  because I've accomplished great things as well, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=200.34s)]
*  but I do think that this is a little bit strategic [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=202.54s)]
*  on both parts. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=206.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=207.78s)]
*  I think the takeaway for parents is if you have a choice [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=208.86s)]
*  between sending a kid to Penn or Kentucky, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=210.58s)]
*  choose Kentucky in a second. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  I appreciate it coming on. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=215.02s)]
*  We are rooting for you, Riley Gaines. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=216.5s)]
*  Good to see you. Yeah, thank you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=218.38s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUH4Q1GAE0s&t=219.94s)]
