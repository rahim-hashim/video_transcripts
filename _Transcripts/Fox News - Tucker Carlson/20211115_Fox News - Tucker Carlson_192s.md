# Tucker issues a challenge to major investment house
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 15, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo)
*  So the promise, the essential promise of America is equal treatment under the law. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=0.0s)]
*  We're all citizens and we are judged equally for what we do. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=5.44s)]
*  That's the most important thing we have and it's going away. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=9.28s)]
*  And as if you need more evidence, consider this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=11.84s)]
*  One of the biggest investment firms in the country just announced it will impose strict racial discrimination in its hiring. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=13.84s)]
*  State Street Global Advisors has informed its managers they will need express permission before hiring white men. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=19.84s)]
*  Not because white male applicants aren't qualified to do the job, no, but because they are white and they are male. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  So at State Street Global Advisors, your color can disqualify you from employment. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=32.96s)]
*  The company has said that explicitly. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=37.76s)]
*  Now it's worth remembering that in addition to being immoral, obviously this is illegal under federal law. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=39.76s)]
*  And if you have any questions about that, check the mandatory labor law poster that hangs by law in every break room in every office in America. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=45.04s)]
*  And it will tell you it is illegal to discriminate against people on the basis of their race and hiring. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=52.96s)]
*  Period. Federal law could not be clearer about that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=57.76s)]
*  And yet here's the amazing thing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=61.04s)]
*  The so-called Civil Rights Division at Joe Biden's Justice Department has not said a word about this and they're never going to. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=62.32s)]
*  They're too busy forcing boys onto girls soccer teams and making certain no one tries to put Aunt Jemima back on pancake syrup. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=67.36s)]
*  So for now, anyway, State Street will not face the felony charges it so badly deserves. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=73.6s)]
*  So you've got to wonder if white men are so bad that you need new rules to keep them out of your workplace, then why is the parent company of State Street run by one of them? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=79.2s)]
*  That man's name is Ronald P. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  O'Hanley. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=90.0s)]
*  And as you can see from the picture on your screen, he is both pale and male. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  We took a look at Ron P. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=95.12s)]
*  O'Hanley's official bio this afternoon. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=96.64s)]
*  Technically, it's inaccurate in that it does not describe him as a jolly racist buffoon, but it does concede that he was once a partner at McKinsey and Company and that he is, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=98.72s)]
*  quote, deeply involved in industry efforts around climate, corporate governance and diversity and inclusion. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=107.36s)]
*  Of course he is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=112.72s)]
*  And he's also led, quote, several initiatives on gender equality. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=113.52s)]
*  Needless to say, as if the parody couldn't be more perfect. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=116.96s)]
*  We also learned that Ron O'Hanley is a, quote, avid offshore sailboat racer. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=120.24s)]
*  He's got his own offshore racing boat called Privateer with his own captain to sail it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=125.76s)]
*  This is Mr. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=130.16s)]
*  Diversity and Inclusion. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=130.8s)]
*  Keep in mind that this is the guy telling your son, who's done nothing wrong, who just wants to work, that he can't have a job because he was born the wrong color, which happens to be the same color that Ron P. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=132.88s)]
*  O'Hanley is. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=143.52s)]
*  It's all pretty amazing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=145.44s)]
*  So here's our challenge to Mr. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=146.56s)]
*  Ron P. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  O'Hanley. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=148.16s)]
*  And we hope he's listening tonight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  If you're going to start building apartheid in this country, you go first. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=150.4s)]
*  Quit your stupid job and give it to a woman of color. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Transfer your entire personal portfolio, including your multiple homes, to the Black Lives Matter Foundation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=158.32s)]
*  Give your little sailboat to a deserving family of Haitian immigrants. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=163.6s)]
*  And then start over from scratch at zero under the rules you are now imposing on this generation of young people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=166.72s)]
*  And we'll see how you do, Ron P. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=174.4s)]
*  O'Hanley. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=175.68s)]
*  That would be equity. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=176.4s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_g4ygyNmo&t=187.6s)]
