# Tucker: Here's what America should learn from Hungary
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0)
*  Peter Sciardo is the Foreign Minister of Hungary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=2.56s)]
*  Mr. Sciardo, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=3.6s)]
*  So I know that you're a diplomat. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=5.64s)]
*  You speak diplomatically, as you should. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  But I have to ask, Hungary's example [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=10.44s)]
*  in the way that it controls its borders at very low cost, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  with very straightforward policies that are effective, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=16.4s)]
*  why do you suppose other countries haven't learned [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=19.52s)]
*  that very simple lesson? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=22.44s)]
*  Look, first of all, I have to reject the introduction. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=24.72s)]
*  I've never been a diplomat. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  I happen to be their boss, but I have always been a politician, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=31.04s)]
*  so it's very easy to me to speak honestly and directly, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  and not diplomatically. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=38.64s)]
*  So thank you very much for the invitation, by the way. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=41.04s)]
*  First of all, I have to express my appreciation to you [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=43.44s)]
*  to show the reality about Hungary. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=46.64s)]
*  That's very, very rare. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=48.84s)]
*  We are usually faced by the lies and the fake news [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=51.4s)]
*  produced by the international liberal mainstream. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=57.44s)]
*  And your interview, your report about Hungary [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=60.68s)]
*  is something that brings fresh air to us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  Regarding your question, I can tell you that whenever we have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=68.16s)]
*  meetings of the foreign ministers in the European Union, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=72.8s)]
*  and whenever we discuss border protection, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=76.4s)]
*  migration, security-related issues, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=78.8s)]
*  then the foreign ministers usually send tax messages to me [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=81.32s)]
*  during the debate that I'm doing good and keep on doing that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=85.6s)]
*  and say those things. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=88.52s)]
*  And then I ask them at the end of the debate, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  so my dear friends, why didn't you contribute also? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Then they say, look, you know, back at home, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  there are NGOs, liberal media, coalition government, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=96.32s)]
*  pressure, and so on and so forth. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=99.84s)]
*  So actually, the reason why I think others cannot implement [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  a honest policy on migration is that they feel themselves [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=106.92s)]
*  under pressure by international liberal mainstream media, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=111.76s)]
*  NGOs, and political elites. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=116.12s)]
*  But in Hungary, we have a political stability, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=118.36s)]
*  two-thirds majority in the parliament, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=120.68s)]
*  so we have the luxury to say what we think [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=122.68s)]
*  and act accordingly. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=126.16s)]
*  What's interesting is that that behavior [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=128.16s)]
*  is such a threat to our foreign policy establishment, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=130.52s)]
*  and I think that's why we have these hysterical morons [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=134.04s)]
*  with lifelong history of failure, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=137.0s)]
*  Anne Applebaum or David Fremont, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=139.04s)]
*  people who really supported foreign adventures [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=140.52s)]
*  that hurt our country, hate Hungary, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=143.4s)]
*  and refer to it reflexively as a dictatorship, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=146.4s)]
*  which obviously it's not as a democracy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=148.4s)]
*  Why do you think it's so threatening to them, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=150.68s)]
*  this nation of 10 million people in Central Europe? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=152.64s)]
*  Look, I think why they hate us is that we are conducting [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=157.24s)]
*  patriotic, Christian-based policy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=162.52s)]
*  The target of ours is to fulfill the national interest. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  We are conservative, and in the meantime, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  we are successful. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=176.28s)]
*  So basically, our existence is a danger for them [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=178.36s)]
*  because what they say is that the only way [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  to have a progressive, successful political system [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=188.68s)]
*  is that you have to be extremely liberal, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=192.56s)]
*  and our existence makes it very clear that no, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=196.56s)]
*  this is not the only way to be progressive, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=200.68s)]
*  to be successful, to fulfill the interest of your nation, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=203.44s)]
*  but our way, the conservative, patriotic, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  Christian democratic way, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=211.0s)]
*  respecting our historic and religious heritage, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  respecting our values like family. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=217.24s)]
*  This brings success also. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=220.44s)]
*  So the reason why they want us to be beaten [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=222.36s)]
*  on the next election is that basically one of the last [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  successful conservative government would be kicked out [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  from power, and then they could speak about the fact [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=232.52s)]
*  that, oh, look, liberal mainstream [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=235.24s)]
*  is the only successful ideology in the world. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=237.0s)]
*  They see you as a much bigger threat than China, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=240.08s)]
*  which just tells you everything. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  They're gonna try to interfere in your election, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  as you well know. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=245.6s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  Peter Sciardo, the Foreign Minister [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  of the Nation of Hungary, thanks. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPs-tc3yi0&t=249.28s)]
