# Brit Hume: Voters saw through the left's CRT 'baloney'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc)
*  Glenn Yonkin will join us in just a moment here on the show, but first we [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=0.0s)]
*  wanted to go as we always do and for good reason to Britt Hume. He is Fox News' [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=4.24s)]
*  senior political analyst. He joins us now. Britt, thanks so much for coming on last [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=7.88s)]
*  night as you were assessing what might happen in this race. You said if [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=11.16s)]
*  McAuliffe loses, this is a massive story. Do you still feel that way and if so, how big? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=15.32s)]
*  Oh yeah, I do Tucker. It was obviously a broadly based protest vote against what [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=20.44s)]
*  Democrats see going on in Washington and it was also a very well engineered [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=26.88s)]
*  campaign by candidate Yonkin himself who positioned himself as a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=32.16s)]
*  obvious alternative, as a completely acceptable alternative to the Democrat [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=38.08s)]
*  McAuliffe, one who did not seem an extremist. He didn't seem a Trumpist. He [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=43.04s)]
*  didn't carry any of the baggage that can hold Republicans back and the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  voters said okay and I accepted him and huge upset, one that was not forecast [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=51.52s)]
*  until only recent days. Very skillful campaign by a novice candidate. Big [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  hill to climb, he climbed it. What's interesting though is that he didn't run [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=63.2s)]
*  on tax cuts. I think that was a feature of his platform, but he ran on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=67.08s)]
*  what we are told are the divisive social issues. Critical race theory, what our [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  kids are taught. I mean he went right to the things that people talk about on [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  social media. Anyone on that? What does that tell you? Well it tells you one [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=81.48s)]
*  thing and that is that there's an argument about this whole question of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=86.64s)]
*  critical race theory in this particular political race and on one side and you're [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=90.2s)]
*  hearing it, I heard it all day today, I saw it everywhere. The critical race is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=95.22s)]
*  not taught in Virginia schools. Critical race is not taught in Virginia schools. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=98.64s)]
*  The AP and the NBC are saying it. It's being said all everywhere on the left. In [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=102.36s)]
*  fact however, there is ample evidence that critical race theory very much [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=107.2s)]
*  influences and is injected into what is being taught in those schools and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=111.36s)]
*  these parents knew that. They came to know it. It may have had something to do [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=116.72s)]
*  with the kids being at home during the pandemic and the kids getting a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=120.16s)]
*  parents getting a closer look at what their kids were learning, but that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  was out there and the parents were right and Yonkin was right and the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=127.88s)]
*  left and Terry McCall and the rest of them were wrong on the facts and as a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=132.56s)]
*  result people people weren't going to vote for somebody who didn't think there [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=136.6s)]
*  was a problem. Yonkin did. So that's where that comes out and of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=139.84s)]
*  course you know you have people on the on the left and some you know [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=145.48s)]
*  shin pullers saying well it was the Republicans who injected race into this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=148.68s)]
*  election. Bologna. The critical race theory itself injects race into the lives [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=153.2s)]
*  of our schoolchildren. It should never have any [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  influence let alone being taught. Now people say you could say technically [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=162.28s)]
*  Tucker it's not being taught in the sense that you know volumes have been [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=165.36s)]
*  written on critical race theory and it's not been handed out as a textbook but [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=168.08s)]
*  its influence and its its tenants are in those schools. I've never figured out [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=171.72000000000003s)]
*  what a critical race theory is to be totally honest after a year of talking [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  about it. They're teaching that some races are morally superior to others, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  that some are inherently sinful and some are inherently saintly and that's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  immoral to teach that because it's wrong. That would be my view. Well what's also [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=185.52s)]
*  wrong about it Tucker is that it rests on this idea that that racism and racial [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=190.92s)]
*  discrimination permeates the experience of citizens in America that that we are [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=197.04s)]
*  inherently and almost incurably racist and that it influences everything and it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  could seize the world through that prism. It's misguided to say the very least and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  people have had enough of it. No doubt about it in my mind. That's for sure. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=212.6s)]
*  Finally. Great to see you tonight. Thank you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNwg2UOolzc&t=217.12s)]
