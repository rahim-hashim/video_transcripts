# Zelenskyy is working for an agenda, not the people of Ukraine: Ex-special ops pilot
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4)
*  So the ESG slash global warming agenda is part of the reason our economy is tanking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=0.0s)]
*  The other part is Ukraine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=6.2s)]
*  We are pushing, in fact engaging in a hot war with Russia at this moment, which has [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=9.0s)]
*  upended energy prices around the world and is getting worse. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. Congress has somehow earmarked more than $90 billion to Ukraine just this year. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=16.92s)]
*  That's double what we spent annually in Afghanistan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=22.84s)]
*  That's far more than Russia's entire annual military budget. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=25.96s)]
*  But it's still not enough for the president of Ukraine, Zelensky. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=30.12s)]
*  He doesn't ask the U.S. Congress for money. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=34.04s)]
*  He demands it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=36.64s)]
*  Here he is over the last three months. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=39.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=40.44s)]
*  We absolutely need the United States to show leadership and give Ukraine the air defense [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  system. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=51.8s)]
*  Believe me, it's not even nearly enough to cover the civilian infrastructure, schools, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=53.16s)]
*  hospitals, universities, homes of Ukrainians. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  We have two key financial needs of the country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  That's $38 billion to make up for the deficit of our budget for next year. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=67.16s)]
*  And other $17 billion that were verified by the World Bank and needed to rebuild the critical [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=73.6s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  We would really like for the support, especially the amount of support, to stay the same and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=81.92s)]
*  to have this joint support from the U.S. society and above all U.S. taxpayers because at the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=87.4s)]
*  end of the day, this is not the money of the government but the money of the people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=93.88s)]
*  Do you know that guy? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=100.64s)]
*  Who is that guy? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=101.64s)]
*  He's some Ukrainian corrupt strongman, really, and he's demanding money from us? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=102.64s)]
*  The gall of that guy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=107.36s)]
*  Where does he get off? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  El Todd Wood is the founder of CD Media and former Special Operations Pilot. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=110.64s)]
*  He joins us today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=113.8s)]
*  Todd, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=114.8s)]
*  So the question of Zelensky is where does he get this attitude? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=116.12s)]
*  He's not a supplicant. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  He is someone who's demanding the U.S. Congress fund his government, not just his war but [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=122.84s)]
*  the salaries of his bureaucrats. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=126.68s)]
*  Like, where does he get this attitude? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=127.68s)]
*  Look, Zelensky was brought to power by an oligarch named Ehor Kolomoisky, which he recently [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=129.88s)]
*  went after and targeted for persecution in Ukraine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=137.08s)]
*  So that tells me something that Zelensky now has a bigger and more important and more powerful [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=140.56s)]
*  and more rich benefactor, and that being the Biden administration, the World Economic Forum, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=145.9s)]
*  and the cabal that's pushing all this agenda on the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=150.88s)]
*  So Zelensky is not working for the people of Ukraine. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=154.8s)]
*  They're suffering massively. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  We have had a team on the ground since May-Dawn in 2014, and we're being told now for months, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=158.76s)]
*  they're saying where is all this aid that's supposed to be coming here? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=164.68s)]
*  We're not seeing anything. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=166.84s)]
*  We're having teams having to go into Poland with our own funds and buy food for the people, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=168.0s)]
*  buy medical supplies. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=171.76s)]
*  A large percentage of the Ukrainian population right now has no water or electricity or heat [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=173.04s)]
*  going into the winter. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=177.56s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=178.68s)]
*  And a lot of them in these high-rise Soviet-built buildings. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=179.68s)]
*  So it's really a disaster. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=182.56s)]
*  Zelensky is working for a bigger agenda, not for the Ukrainian people, that's for sure. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=184.36s)]
*  So $90 billion, there's been no audit of where that money went. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=188.82s)]
*  Democrats in the Congress are fighting an audit. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=192.76s)]
*  Why wouldn't they want to know? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=194.6s)]
*  Well, because approximately, you know, this is, you've got to realize this is the varsity [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=197.68s)]
*  team of money launderers in Ukraine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=201.72s)]
*  We're estimating that only 30% of the supplies and military aid is actually getting to where [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=203.8s)]
*  it needs or supposed to go. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=210.0s)]
*  There's been evidence, which we talked about on your show recently, of a plane crash in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Greece where arms were being shipped overseas. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=215.0s)]
*  And so this money is not getting where it's supposed to go. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  The, a lot of this money is going to offshore. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=221.28s)]
*  You know, we're talking about homes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=224.0s)]
*  You know, there's credible reports that a lot of these Ukrainian officials have bought [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=226.56s)]
*  property offshore. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=230.64s)]
*  They don't want peace. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  They want the money train to continue for the, you know, defense contractors in the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  U.S. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  And I'm fascinated to see what's going to happen when the House gets taken over by the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=238.11999999999998s)]
*  GOP. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  And hopefully this money train stops. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  And then you see decent, reasonable, conservative people, nice people like Joni Ernst backing [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=253.48s)]
*  I think the Republicans need to wake up and understand they've been had in a very profound [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=254.48s)]
*  way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=257.92s)]
*  El Todd Wood, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7Wg0-hMs4&t=258.92s)]
