# Tucker roasts book that compares AOC to Jesus
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Tonight, happy Friday, where all the news [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=0.0s)]
*  stacks up. We told you the beginning of the week that Canada had descended into tyranny, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=4.24s)]
*  and in fact it has. Justin Trudeau has declared that he controls all the money in Canada. He can [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=8.48s)]
*  take yours at will. Today, Trudeau had non-violent protesters and independent reporters arrested. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=13.84s)]
*  In some cases, they were trampled with horses. These are the most egregious human rights [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=20.16s)]
*  violations by a Western government in recent memory. And yet the Biden administration is [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=25.12s)]
*  encouraging all of it. Biden's State Department has refused to criticize Justin Trudeau and his [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  successes in any way. Instead, our mannequin-in-chief spent yet another day yammering on about Ukraine, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=34.72s)]
*  as if we're supposed to believe that's more important than our own problems. What country [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=41.68s)]
*  is this guy in charge of anyway? Someone ought to tell him. And in fact, we were going to tell him, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  right at the top of tonight's show. That was our lead. A serious topic for a serious time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=51.84s)]
*  And then, out of nowhere, we received an early copy of Take Up Space, the unprecedented AOC. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=57.84s)]
*  It's a book-length suck-up to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by the editors at New York [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=65.2s)]
*  Magazine. It's coming out next week. Now, a hagiography of Sandy Cortez is like a box of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=69.92s)]
*  Fig Newtons. You know it's wrong to open it, but the temptation is strong. And so we did. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  And before we knew it, we consumed the whole thing. We still feel sick. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=80.56s)]
*  So that is what we're opening with tonight. The new Sandy Cortez book. Yes, it's a lighter topic [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=84.0s)]
*  than tyranny in Canada or war in Ukraine, both of which we will get to in a minute. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=89.12s)]
*  Our only excuse is it's Friday and we've got limited self-control with stuff like this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=93.28s)]
*  It's an amazing book. Let's put it this way. It opens by comparing Ocasio-Cortez to Jesus. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=97.76s)]
*  And then it suggests that because she once got second place in a high school science competition, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=103.28s)]
*  she could have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. It is a remarkable piece of journalism. We plan [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=107.6s)]
*  to put extensive excerpts from the book on the screen tonight for you to read. And then we thought, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  who reads anymore? Not Sandy Cortez. She never reads. Reading is racism. It's so white people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=119.36s)]
*  So instead, we've asked our senior producer, Alex McCaskill, to read the passages for us. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  You may recognize Alex McCaskill's melodious outer London-inflected voice from the Stacey [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Abrams softcore porn novels that we have featured on the show. We've asked him today [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=136.16s)]
*  to compare these two projects. He said he found this one creepier. We'll let you be the judge. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=140.4s)]
*  Here's a section in which the fangirls at New York Magazine let us know why they wrote this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  book in the first place. There are a lot of politicians they could have fawned over. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=150.64s)]
*  They picked Sandy Cortez because she's a lady. To say she is a feminist is to understate the facts. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=154.48s)]
*  Ocasio-Cortez is the first politician in history to live fully out loud while female, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  and the degradations of womanhood are personal to her. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=167.28s)]
*  So she's not just the first woman to represent her congressional district in the state of New [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=172.16s)]
*  York. She's the first woman in human history to get elected to something and then, quote, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=175.92s)]
*  live fully out loud while female. What exactly does that mean? Is it a trans thing? Honestly, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=180.0s)]
*  we don't know. She's definitely loud. But we did understand the next line. The degradations [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=186.32s)]
*  of womanhood are personal to her. Well, that's certainly true. No one has done more personally [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=191.6s)]
*  to degrade American womanhood than Sandy Cortez has. She is living proof that 60 years of feminist [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=197.68s)]
*  liberation did not work. Sandy Cortez is not empowered. She's neurotic and silly. She is far [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=203.6s)]
*  more frivolous than any 1950s housewife ever was. June Cleaver was a more serious person. At least [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=210.4s)]
*  she made dinner. Here's what Sandy Cortez does. She puts on makeup while talking about herself. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=216.08s)]
*  As the youngest woman in Congress, and as a woman of color, it's so hard to be taken seriously. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=222.4s)]
*  It's just, you know, it's like any workplace where sometimes it feels like you have to jump [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=230.72000000000003s)]
*  up and down for anyone to listen. It's just really difficult because some people are just born in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  bodies that are naturally taken more seriously. People already try to diminish me and diminish [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  my voice as young and frivolous and unintelligent. They don't take me seriously when I put on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=252.32s)]
*  eyeshadow. People are calling me unintelligent just because I'm dumb. It's pretty funny. But the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=259.52s)]
*  funniest of all was hearing Sandy Cortez describe herself as a woman of color. She often does. No [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=264.4s)]
*  one ever dares to challenge that description, but every honest person knows it is hilariously [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=269.92s)]
*  absurd. There is no place on earth outside of American colleges and newsrooms where Sandy [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=275.04s)]
*  Cortez would be recognized as a quote woman of color because she's not. She's a rich, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  entitled white lady. She's the pampered obnoxious ski bunny in the matching snow suit who tells you [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  to pull up your mask while you're standing in the lift line at Jackson Hole. They're all the same. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=290.88s)]
*  It doesn't matter what shade they are. Apparently the editors at New York Magazine don't ski. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=294.8s)]
*  They spend the entire book pretending that Sandy Cortez has just emerged from some teeming favela [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=299.68s)]
*  in the slums of Rio to save the world's poor. Reading it, you would have literally no clue [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=305.36s)]
*  she was a credential member of the overclass. You'd think she was St. Francis. On the day of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=311.36s)]
*  the House vote, Ocasio-Cortez stood up in the chamber, again wearing all white. She looked [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  like a prophet or a medium tapping a deep well of popular fury. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=322.56s)]
*  Radiant and white in her gown, bathed in the glow of holy righteousness, a prophet for our time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=328.48s)]
*  Imagine Isaiah but with nails to match the handbag. That's how New York Magazine describes Sandy [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=335.6s)]
*  Cortez. And that's weird because we live in this country too and that's not at all how we [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=340.64s)]
*  remember the moment. Here's a clip from the speech the book is referring to. Look at this person and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=345.92s)]
*  ask yourself if you can feel God's presence. But we have to go into this vote eyes wide open. What [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=352.0s)]
*  did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=359.44s)]
*  as possible in American history. A prophet or proof that adderall abuse is more common than we [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=364.4s)]
*  admit? We'll let you decide. We will tell you that the editors at New York Magazine are highly [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=372.56s)]
*  impressed by the way Ocasio-Cortez looks. They think she's hot. It's a major theme in the book [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=377.36s)]
*  and in fact it's a major theme with Ocasio-Cortez herself. She talks about her beauty constantly. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=383.2s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago she let us know how hard it is that everyone wants to sleep with her [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  all the time. What a burden. It's like living as a nudist in the Dallas Cowboys locker room. Men are [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=392.64s)]
*  so aroused by her TikTok videos she can barely get through a day. Yet she does her job anyway. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=397.6s)]
*  That's why she's a hero. The burden of sexiness weighs heavily on her sleek and tawny shoulders [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=403.28s)]
*  but she bears up under it. Listen to New York Magazine's account. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=408.64s)]
*  Ocasio-Cortez would have been well aware of her impact on others. Her rhetoric could be [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  confrontational and her politics countercultural but her appearance conformed to society's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=418.0s)]
*  conventions. With her wide apart eyes, arched brows and tawny complexion she could have modeled [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=424.23999999999995s)]
*  for a skincare line and in fact later capitalize on these assets by shooting a makeup tutorial for Vogue. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=432.16s)]
*  She could have been a model for a skincare line and that's why she's such an amazing political [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=441.92s)]
*  leader because she's so pretty. Imagine a man saying that. It would probably be considered [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  patronizing if not grounds for cancellation but New York Magazine isn't ashamed to objectify [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It makes you wonder what would happen if one day she gained 100 pounds and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=459.12s)]
*  got eczema on her nose and forgot to trim her ear hair. Well you know what would happen? Her political [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=464.4s)]
*  influence would evaporate instantly. She's not the leader of an ideological movement. She's a living [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=468.72s)]
*  marketing campaign. Here she is selling cosmetics. I really like starting to blend with my fingers [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=474.08s)]
*  and then I'll go in afterwards and polish it off. I've been lately playing with a lot of eyeshadows. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=482.72s)]
*  I go in with a little kind of a lighter color and I just wash it all over my lid. I tried the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=488.72s)]
*  shimmer and it it looks fire. It looks good. Whenever you see me wearing a red lip most of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=496.8s)]
*  the time it's this one and again I start small and I start working my way out. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=504.56s)]
*  So makeup is a process. You know you start small and then you work your way out. Concentric circles. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=511.44s)]
*  That's the way she uses cosmetics. We have to but she seems pretty good at it. Painting her own face [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=516.16s)]
*  may be her one real skill but something useful? Ah it's a different story. Watch this CNN account [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=521.04s)]
*  of her attempt to assemble her own IKEA furniture. Oh shoot. Five second rule. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=527.92s)]
*  Hey everyone. She was munching popcorn, sipping white wine and assembling furniture on Instagram live. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=535.6s)]
*  All right what am I doing here? AOC moved into her Washington apartment three months ago but has been [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  too busy to furnish it. Did I do this wrong? Boom! I did it. Obviously there are a lot of self-involved [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=549.44s)]
*  people in politics. All of them pretty much but it takes a special kind of narcissist to imagine [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=558.72s)]
*  that the world desperately wants to see you pull together a particle board coffee table [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=565.2s)]
*  but New York magazine can't get enough of it. Here's their account of what you just saw. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  On this night and again during another session assembling IKEA furniture in July [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=574.0s)]
*  she shone a bright light on her own complicated mess. She was in a hurry to get her own [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=578.96s)]
*  furniture in July. She shone a bright light on her own complicated multifaceted self. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  In that video Ocasio-Cortez looks thin. Her trousers sag. She's wearing her glasses and her [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=590.4000000000001s)]
*  hair is up in a sloppy just about to wash my face bun. She's wearing an old moto jacket and is sitting [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  on the floor of her unfurnished apartment eating a bowl of popcorn and drinking a glass of wine. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00jERnz8Rw&t=602.08s)]
