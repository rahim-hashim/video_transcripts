# Oakland DMV has driver's manuals in every language but English
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE)
*  Cheyenne, Kenny is the president of the Turning Point Oakland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=0.0s)]
*  Activism Hub, and she joins us tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=3.12s)]
*  Cheyenne, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=4.72s)]
*  So if, I mean, just to ask the obvious question, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=6.96s)]
*  if you don't have an English language driver's manual, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=9.56s)]
*  then people who speak English can't study [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=12.94s)]
*  for the driving test, is that right? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=15.38s)]
*  Exactly, Tucker. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=17.52s)]
*  I don't know how we're gonna know how to drive [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=18.52s)]
*  if we can't even study the manual. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=20.46s)]
*  How do, I was really struck by this video, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=23.2s)]
*  and thank you so much for making it, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=25.94s)]
*  because it's small things like this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=27.56s)]
*  that really tell you what's happening to the country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  But I was struck by the total lack of sympathy [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=32.16s)]
*  that you got from the woman at the DMV, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=34.06s)]
*  and she didn't seem that interested in the fact [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  you couldn't read a driver's manual [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=38.28s)]
*  in your own country at all. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=40.34s)]
*  No, she did not care, and in fact, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=42.22s)]
*  she told me to stop filming. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=44.7s)]
*  She didn't seem like she didn't really want people to know [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=46.32s)]
*  there was no handbooks in English anymore. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  This is a public place. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=52.44s)]
*  We should be allowed to film and talk about this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=53.72s)]
*  Especially because we're all trying to learn to drive, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=58.28s)]
*  and we can't because we can't read the manuals. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=60.88s)]
*  Well, of course, and it's your country, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=65.0s)]
*  and this is the DMV, these people work for you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=66.92s)]
*  Last question, I just wanna make sure [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=70.98s)]
*  this is exactly correct, factually. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=72.78s)]
*  They didn't have an English language driver's manual [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=75.64s)]
*  for over a month in the purportedly rich estate [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=78.16s)]
*  in the country, they just couldn't get around [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=81.36s)]
*  to printing it or something? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=82.76s)]
*  A whole month, an entire month. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=83.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=87.16s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=88.0s)]
*  Shannon Kinney, I appreciate your coming on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=89.28s)]
*  and telling that story and for documenting it for us. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=90.84s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. Thank you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UViiDnUN_wE&t=93.44s)]
