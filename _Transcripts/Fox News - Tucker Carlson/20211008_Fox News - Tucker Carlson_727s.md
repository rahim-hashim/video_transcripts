# Tucker: This is what the country is fighting about
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Tonight we're gonna do something [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=0.0s)]
*  a little different for the next hour. We're gonna try to explain what this [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=3.44s)]
*  country is fighting with itself about. What are the lines that divide us? It's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  pretty obviously not the old partisan divide that the rest of us grew up with, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=13.32s)]
*  Republican versus Democrat. You figured that out now. You look over at the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=17.04s)]
*  Democratic side, you see Rashida Tlaib, you're pretty certain she's not on your [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=20.46s)]
*  side, obviously. But then the question is, is Mitch McConnell on your side? And the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  answer, as you well know, is no, not really. So what divides us? What is the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=29.96s)]
*  dividing line? And it's really simple. The people in charge are intent on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=35.44s)]
*  replacing our free democratic system with an authoritarian system, where they [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=41.04s)]
*  don't convince you of anything. They simply make you do things and they [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=45.56s)]
*  benefit from that. There are people in this country who are opposed to that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=49.0s)]
*  They are anti-authoritarian and if you look at who we book on this show, that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=54.08s)]
*  may explain why we do it. You may have noticed we have a lot of former lefties [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=58.12s)]
*  on the show. Glenn Greenwald is the most obvious, Alex Berenson as well, and many [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  others. Now we probably don't agree with these people on a lot of things. Are we [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=67.0s)]
*  on the same side on abortion? We've never asked. But one thing we know for certain [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=71.72s)]
*  is that they are totally opposed to authoritarianism. So that really is the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=76.0s)]
*  divide. People are for an authoritarian America and those who are for a free [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  It's that simple. And once you start to understand politics through that lens, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=85.76s)]
*  you figure out what's really going on. By the way, looking at polls is an [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  unusually bad way to understand what's happening in American politics. Polls are [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=93.72s)]
*  often wrong. And when they are wrong, they're almost always wrong in the same [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  direction. The last presidential election made that very clear. The polling [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=102.04s)]
*  outfit Quinnipiac, for example, which is attached to some kind of college in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  Connecticut, predicted that Joe Biden would win the popular vote by 11 points. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=109.84s)]
*  It also predicted that Mitch McConnell was in tough shape in Kentucky. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=115.0s)]
*  Pollsters even convinced a lot of Democratic Party donors that they had a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  real shot of winning the state of Texas. In retrospect, it's clear all of this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  was partisan fantasy and it had a purpose. It was all designed to make a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=126.11999999999999s)]
*  mentally decaying senator from Delaware look like Teddy Roosevelt riding a [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=130.0s)]
*  massive wave of popular support. Of course, that was a lie. So once you [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=134.12s)]
*  understand that, once you recognize what these polls are actually designed to do, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=139.24s)]
*  they're designed to put Democratic Party leaders in the best possible light, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=144.12s)]
*  it is worth noting when the polls move in the opposite direction, when they [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=148.0s)]
*  start to reflect badly on the Democratic Party. That's been happening over the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=152.72s)]
*  past several weeks. According again to Quinnipiac, a reliably left wing pollster, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=156.6s)]
*  Joe Biden's national approval rating is now 38%. 60% of independents disapprove [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=161.84s)]
*  of what Joe Biden is doing as president. A new AP poll noted that just 34% of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=168.96s)]
*  Americans are pleased with the direction of the country. That's called the right [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=174.36s)]
*  track wrong track poll. And for the party in power, it is very bad news. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=177.36s)]
*  This means that the very same people who just last year lied to you, to your face [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=182.96s)]
*  about how popular Joe Biden was, are now admitting that he is actually the least [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=187.16s)]
*  popular president in modern political history. Why are they telling you this [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=192.0s)]
*  all of a sudden? Why are these reliably Democratic pollsters telling Democratic [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=196.4s)]
*  voters that their president is unpopular? Maybe because they have no choice. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=201.72s)]
*  Maybe there are other reasons. We're not sure. What is absolutely clear is that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  according to a new poll from Pew, Democratic Party voters understand what [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=211.12s)]
*  this means. And what it means is in a free and fair Democratic system, they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=215.0s)]
*  can't win. If we allocate power based on who's the most popular with the public, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=219.32s)]
*  and that's the basic premise of democracy, the Democratic Party is in very [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=224.52s)]
*  tough shape. And they know that. And that may be why, according to polls, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Democrats know overwhelmingly want the government to make their political [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=233.68s)]
*  opponents shut up. More than three quarters of Democratic Party voters want [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  the tech companies to, quote, restrict false information online, even if it [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  limits freedom of information. Think about that for a second. More than 60% of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=247.24s)]
*  Democratic voters want the federal government to, quote, control that flow [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=251.8s)]
*  of information over the Internet. So all of that contravenes the First Amendment [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  to the Bill of Rights, which is the very core of our system of government and of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=260.72s)]
*  our culture. It's what makes America great. And now the overwhelming majority [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  of Democratic voters are against it. So that's authoritarianism. There's no other [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=268.0s)]
*  word for it. And it's ironic, considering for four years, prominent Democrats told [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=272.76s)]
*  us we were living through a fascist system. Donald Trump was a fascist. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=277.24s)]
*  But of course, they were describing their own attitudes. So we're going to spend [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  the next hour looking at the rise of authoritarian impulses on the left and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  try to figure out where those came from and where they're going. Now, none of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=290.64s)]
*  this is brand new. You'll recall that Democratic Party politicians have been [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=295.36s)]
*  pushing for censorship for a long time, certainly since Trump won in 2016. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  They blamed that victory on Facebook. Here's Ed Markey in last October, for [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  example, calling for more censorship. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=308.36s)]
*  The issue is not that the companies before us today are taking too many posts [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=310.88s)]
*  down. The issue is that they're leaving too many dangerous posts up. In fact, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  they're amplifying harmful content so that it spreads like wildfire and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=321.32s)]
*  tortures our democracy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, they're not censoring enough because these posts, according to Ed Markey, who [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=330.56s)]
*  will literally say anything, you should know, are, quote, dangerous. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=335.88s)]
*  But Markey never explained what was dangerous about them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=340.52s)]
*  But you got the message. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=343.52s)]
*  They all did. A few weeks after Markey said that, Big Tech effectively removed [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=345.32s)]
*  the elected president of the United States from the Internet. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=349.8s)]
*  They silenced him completely and virtually nobody said anything about it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=351.6s)]
*  So it didn't stop. It merely accelerated. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=355.56s)]
*  Now, Democrats and their allies in the news media have decided to drop all [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=357.92s)]
*  pretense. Jonathan Chape writes for New York magazine. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=362.12s)]
*  He's considered smart on the left, one of the weirdest people practicing [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  journalism today. He just published a deeply revealing piece in New York [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=368.56s)]
*  magazine. Here's the headline from it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=372.52s)]
*  And we're quoting, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=374.56s)]
*  Right? Because Republicans are calling for censorship. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=385.56s)]
*  So that's how the Democratic Party is responding to the collapsing poll [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=389.56s)]
*  numbers of their president. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=394.08s)]
*  They're accusing the other side of authoritarianism while practicing it [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=396.16s)]
*  themselves. Right. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=400.08s)]
*  So you'll recall that Joe Biden voters destroyed statues and destroyed our [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=403.08s)]
*  country's biggest cities for more than a year and the police did nothing about [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=407.8s)]
*  it. And our media class applauded. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=410.8s)]
*  And yet, because justice is no longer meted out equally, if someone [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  dares to dishonor the legacy of St. George Floyd, the New York Police [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=418.84s)]
*  Department's special hate crimes division springs into action. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  Here's an actual quote, by the way, from this week. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=425.32s)]
*  On October 3rd, 2021, at approximately 10, 15 a.m. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  in Union Square Park, a person on a skateboard threw gray paint on the face [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  and base of a statue of George Floyd. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=436.4s)]
*  That's the NYPD bulletin. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=439.32s)]
*  So that's not really hypocrisy anymore. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=444.84s)]
*  It's hierarchy. What they're telling you is that crimes against their ideas [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=447.28s)]
*  are the only crimes that matter. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=451.4s)]
*  Well, that attitude has no popular support in this country, so you can only [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=453.79999999999995s)]
*  enforce it by force using surveillance to root out people who've got the wrong [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=456.96s)]
*  ideas. And that's exactly the basis on which the Biden administration is [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=461.12s)]
*  proceeding. That's why the administration has now given itself the authority to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=465.84s)]
*  monitor everything that happens, for example, in your private bank account. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=468.96s)]
*  An effort that I know you're a proponent of for the IRS to collect more [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=473.12s)]
*  information and more tax dollars, but more information about taxpayers' [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=477.64s)]
*  bank accounts, including annual cash flows. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  And I was curious whether you think the IRS has the wherewithal to actually do [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=486.04s)]
*  that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, of course they do. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=494.52s)]
*  And a simple way for the IRS to get a sense of where that might be is just a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  few pieces of information about individuals' bank accounts. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=503.28s)]
*  Did you see that? The most interesting part of that exchange was not the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=510.0s)]
*  Treasury secretary. She's embraced authoritarianism full blown. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=513.04s)]
*  It's the creepy little shill from CNBC. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=516.72s)]
*  And the question is not, does the IRS have the right to snoop into your bank [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=519.48s)]
*  account with no evidence you've done anything wrong? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=523.6s)]
*  His question is, do they have the wherewithal? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=526.52s)]
*  Do they have the manpower? Can they actually pull it off? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=528.6s)]
*  To which he says, of course, we're the government. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  We can do anything. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=533.48s)]
*  So after January 6th, this show reported that Bank of America, quote, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=535.4s)]
*  proactively rooted through customers' private financial information to find [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=538.44s)]
*  individuals who, quote, met thresholds of interest. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=542.48s)]
*  They spied on their own customers. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=546.0400000000001s)]
*  And then, like the good East Germans they are, they passed those names to the FBI [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=548.28s)]
*  without telling anybody involved. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=552.6s)]
*  The Democratic Party approves of this and they want to make certain this kind of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=555.32s)]
*  invasion of privacy is permanent. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=559.08s)]
*  It's codified. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=561.4000000000001s)]
*  And of course, they want to control your children, too, the center of your life. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=563.08s)]
*  They'll destroy anyone who tries to stand in the way of this. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=565.76s)]
*  Bradley Keyes, for example, we could give you a million. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=569.12s)]
*  Here's just one. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=571.24s)]
*  Keyes was a track and field coach at Pembroke Academy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=572.5200000000001s)]
*  He was fired because he didn't think it was good for his athletes to have to wear [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=575.44s)]
*  masks as they were playing tennis. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=579.48s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=581.68s)]
*  My goal is to get these mandates removed. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=582.52s)]
*  And it's not just track and field. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=584.84s)]
*  It's tennis, it's baseball, it's every outdoor sport. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=586.4s)]
*  Masks will be where masks will be worn all times, practices and competitions. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=588.88s)]
*  Tennis, wonderful example. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  Singles tennis. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=597.36s)]
*  You go watch practices. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=598.6s)]
*  Everyone's wearing masks. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=600.12s)]
*  Competitions, they will be wearing masks, even though they're 30 to 60 feet apart [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=601.8s)]
*  on the courts. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=605.76s)]
*  So we're going to tell you what we've told you a thousand times before. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=606.32s)]
*  None of this is science. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=609.4000000000001s)]
*  There's not a single study anywhere in the world that suggests kids benefit by [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=611.08s)]
*  wearing masks as they play sports outdoors. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=616.4000000000001s)]
*  In fact, they are hurt by it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=618.84s)]
*  That's both common sense and the scientific consensus on the question. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=620.4000000000001s)]
*  But the fact is it's happening anyway. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=624.24s)]
*  And that's the point. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=626.6400000000001s)]
*  They don't feel the need to justify their decisions with science. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=628.2800000000001s)]
*  And in fact, they will punish actual scientists who are not going to be able to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=631.7600000000001s)]
*  do so. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=636.2s)]
*  They will punish those who object to these unnecessary medical mandates. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=636.84s)]
*  Aaron Carrity, for example, is a physician at the University of California. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=640.5200000000001s)]
*  He's the director of the medical ethics program at UC Irvine. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  Not a small job. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=646.72s)]
*  He's just announced the university has, quote, put me on leave. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=648.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=651.32s)]
*  For challenging their vaccine mandates in court. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=652.1600000000001s)]
*  Oh, so it's not a question of whether vaccine mandates help or hurt or good for [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=655.84s)]
*  public health. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=662.2800000000001s)]
*  And anyone who challenges it is crushed. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=663.24s)]
*  The weak are hurt the most profoundly, as always. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=667.12s)]
*  Here's a story we'll be telling you a lot more about it in coming weeks about a [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=671.08s)]
*  woman in Colorado who is facing death. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=673.84s)]
*  She's got stage five renal failure. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=675.88s)]
*  She's just been denied a kidney transplant. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=677.64s)]
*  Now, she has a donor, a willing donor who has a kidney for her. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=680.0s)]
*  Everything is ready to go. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=683.04s)]
*  But according to the health system there, the woman and her donor have not taken [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=685.16s)]
*  the covid shot. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=689.16s)]
*  The donor explained that her vaccination status, quote, does not affect any other [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=690.84s)]
*  patient on the transplant list. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=694.68s)]
*  How can I sit here? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=696.6s)]
*  The donor asked and allow them to murder my friend when I've got a perfectly good [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=697.52s)]
*  kidney and I can save her life. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=700.24s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=702.4s)]
*  No one in the Biden administration has bothered to answer it or even think about [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=703.84s)]
*  it. Instead, they're forcing anyone who raises these questions to be quiet. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=706.8s)]
*  That's not a democratic system. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=711.36s)]
*  That's an authoritarian system. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEsd7GJ5sk&t=713.0s)]
