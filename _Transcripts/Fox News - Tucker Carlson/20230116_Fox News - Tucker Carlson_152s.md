# Miranda Devine: Was this a quid-pro-quo situation?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4)
*  Miranda Vine is a New York Post columnist and really the world's authority on Hunter Biden's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=0.0s)]
*  laptop, author of Laptop from Hell. She joins us with a reaction to all of this. Miranda, you've been [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=4.96s)]
*  on parts of this story for years now. What do you make of this? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=10.0s)]
*  Well, it just looks like projection from Joe Biden, doesn't it? As usual, it's the Democrats' [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=15.84s)]
*  tool of trade to accuse their opponents of the very sins that they are committing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=23.52s)]
*  It's a little obvious in this case now, and you just wonder why it's come out and really what the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=29.52s)]
*  true story is about these confidential documents. But as far as the University of Pennsylvania goes, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=35.92s)]
*  there's a long, incestuous, symbiotic relationship with the Bidens. Joe Biden, you know, he's got his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=43.04s)]
*  grandchildren in there, he got the children of friends in there. He treated it as his own little [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=51.44s)]
*  playpen. And of course, when he stepped down from being Vice President, he was paid almost a million [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=58.32s)]
*  dollars by the University of Pennsylvania. He put his name on that supposed think tank. And in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=66.48s)]
*  return, I suppose, his name attracted a lot of Chinese money. As you just said, there was [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=73.76s)]
*  you know, the amount of money that came in from China to the University after Joe Biden opened that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=82.0s)]
*  think tank, quadrupled, almost quadrupled. It went from about 20 million to over 70, almost 75 million. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  So you have to look at a quid pro quo there. And then you talk about Naomi Biden, Joe Biden's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=99.28s)]
*  granddaughter, the oldest daughter of Hunter Biden, and just this very casual offer from a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=106.0s)]
*  Penn professor of this propaganda tour sponsored and paid for by the Chinese Communist Party [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=112.88s)]
*  with business class tickets. And she asked Hunter what he thought. And he said, go for it and ask [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=121.68s)]
*  for two tickets so you can bring your boyfriend. It's apprentice griftership. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  It's just beyond belief and happening out in public. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  But of course, you know that because you've been dealing with this for years. My name is [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=136.72s)]
*  David Vine of the New York Post. We appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly-g45ve_j4&t=138.95999999999998s)]
