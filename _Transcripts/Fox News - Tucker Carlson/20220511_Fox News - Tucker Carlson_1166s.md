# Tucker: There is something really wrong
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight there is nothing in the world worse [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  than finding out that your deepest fears are justified. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  That's the nightmare scenario, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=7.32s)]
*  learning there really is a zombie in the closet. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=8.56s)]
*  Let's say you're a kid and you've convinced yourself [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=11.52s)]
*  that your parents don't really love you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=13.8s)]
*  They claim they do, they say it all the time, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  usually without looking up from their iPhones, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=17.6s)]
*  but you can tell they don't really mean it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=19.88s)]
*  They don't seem sincere. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  And then one Christmas morning confirmation, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=23.36s)]
*  you discover they've forgotten to buy you presents, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=25.36s)]
*  any presents. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=27.16s)]
*  They were busy and it just slipped their mind. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=28.28s)]
*  Instead they spent all their time and all their money [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  buying gifts for a kid down the street. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=32.6s)]
*  So all the things that you asked for, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  they gave to another nine year old you have never met. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=36.46s)]
*  How'd that make you feel? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, you'd be crushed, but you would also be vindicated. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=41.6s)]
*  You would know for a dead certain fact [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=44.56s)]
*  that your parents really didn't love you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=46.56s)]
*  They're not even very interested in you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=48.36s)]
*  That's how a lot of Americans felt last night, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=50.94s)]
*  watching the House of Representatives approve [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=53.2s)]
*  yet another massive aid package for Ukraine. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=55.24s)]
*  Nothing against Ukraine, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  but we could probably use that money here right about now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=59.92s)]
*  After a hundred years [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=63.14s)]
*  of virtually uninterrupted wealth generation, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  the American economy appears to be faltering in ways [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=66.72s)]
*  that are scary to anyone who's paying attention. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=69.28s)]
*  Even people who aren't paying attention can sense [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=72.06s)]
*  there's something really wrong. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=74.1s)]
*  Lots of people are not working. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=76.08s)]
*  Those who are working are getting poor quickly [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=77.44s)]
*  thanks to inflation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=79.4s)]
*  All of a sudden, everything is wildly more expensive. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=80.86s)]
*  Have you noticed? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=83.30000000000001s)]
*  We literally have a shortage of baby formula right now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=84.46s)]
*  Did you think that would happen in America ever? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=87.74s)]
*  And yet it is happening. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=90.44s)]
*  And so is the deadliest drug epidemic in our history. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=91.46s)]
*  About 107,000 of your fellow Americans, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=94.41999999999999s)]
*  most of them young people [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=97.13999999999999s)]
*  who should have had long productive lives are instead dead. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=98.66s)]
*  They have died from drug ODs over the past year. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=102.36s)]
*  This is the saddest thing that has happened [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  in our country in a very long time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=106.78s)]
*  And yet Congress, which claims to run the country, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=108.94s)]
*  can't be bothered even to acknowledge it, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=111.41999999999999s)]
*  much less do anything about it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=113.18s)]
*  Instead, your representatives in Washington [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  just voted to send yet another $40 billion [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=117.38000000000001s)]
*  to the Ukrainian oligarchs [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  who paid off the president's son. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=121.94000000000001s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  And it's just the latest check that Congress has cut them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=124.86000000000001s)]
*  You can add it to the approximately $14 billion [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  they've already spent on Ukraine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=130.78s)]
*  That brings the total as of tonight [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=132.70000000000002s)]
*  to more than $54 billion. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=134.5s)]
*  How much is that? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=137.22s)]
*  Well, for perspective, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  it is more than we spent per year on average [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=140.44s)]
*  on the war in Afghanistan, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=143.24s)]
*  a war that began with a direct attack on the United States. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=144.74s)]
*  $54 billion, that's about as much as Russia, the country, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=148.0s)]
*  spends on its entire armed forces [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=151.72s)]
*  over the course of a full year. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=153.6s)]
*  It is a ludicrous amount. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=155.72s)]
*  And yet Congress happily approved it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=158.26s)]
*  In fact, they allocated $7 billion more [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=160.12s)]
*  than Joe Biden asked for. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=162.56s)]
*  That's how excited they were to do it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=163.92s)]
*  So where's this money going? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=166.84s)]
*  Oh, that's the best part. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=168.24s)]
*  Congress has decided to fix all of the pressing problems [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=169.86s)]
*  that need to be fixed, except fix them in Ukraine, not here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  So the main course of all of this funding from day one [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=176.94000000000003s)]
*  has been to secure Ukraine's borders, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  because you know, you can't have a country without borders. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=181.8s)]
*  They have to be secure. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=184.62s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi strongly believes that about Ukraine, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=186.22000000000003s)]
*  and so do her friends on the Republican side. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  So Ukrainian border security is the main goal. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=191.22000000000003s)]
*  Then there's the problem of quote, food insecurity, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  not here in Ukraine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=197.38000000000002s)]
*  Food's getting expensive in Ukraine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=199.02s)]
*  So we're gonna spend $760 million to fix that, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=200.74s)]
*  just in this check, and not just in Ukraine. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=204.18s)]
*  Congress was feeling kind of sporty, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  also added $150 million for something called [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=210.22s)]
*  the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  because while we're feeding Ukraine, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=215.9s)]
*  why not feed the rest of the world? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=217.34s)]
*  We've got more food than we can use. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=218.34s)]
*  And of course, that will obviously include baby formula too, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  because kids in other countries need to eat. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=222.96s)]
*  Then there's another huge chunk of cash to quote, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=226.24s)]
*  combat human trafficking. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=228.58s)]
*  Now, not combat human trafficking in Texas, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=230.02s)]
*  where it is now ubiquitous thanks to the open borders [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=232.28s)]
*  with Mexico, but to combat human trafficking in Ukraine. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=234.66000000000003s)]
*  Because it's sad what's happening there, but not here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=238.34s)]
*  That's not sad, we're ignoring it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=240.36s)]
*  There's still more money to make sure Ukrainians [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=242.5s)]
*  have emergency shelter, because apparently, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=244.34s)]
*  more than a million Americans aren't homeless tonight. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=246.86s)]
*  There's 900 million to make sure Ukrainians have access [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=249.38000000000002s)]
*  to quote, entitlement programs, our entitlement programs, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  they'll need them when they arrive here, as many will. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=255.36s)]
*  In other words, you can't afford to fill your truck, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=257.98s)]
*  but you now get to pay the living expenses [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=260.86s)]
*  of anyone who shows up in your country [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=262.66s)]
*  claiming to be from Ukraine, and you will. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=264.14s)]
*  And then, because paying off your friends [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=266.9s)]
*  is always the real point of these exercises in Washington, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=268.86s)]
*  there are billions more dollars for Lloyd Austin's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=272.1s)]
*  former employers in the weapons business. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=274.74s)]
*  That would include $72 million for something [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=277.48s)]
*  the bill describes as quote, research, development, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=279.7s)]
*  test and evaluation in Ukraine. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=282.42s)]
*  Hmm, now don't say bio labs, because that's not allowed, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=285.66s)]
*  but honestly, this is weird. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=288.74s)]
*  Ukraine is a war zone, and therefore, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=290.42s)]
*  probably not a great place for scientific research [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=292.54s)]
*  right now, but whatever. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=295.26000000000005s)]
*  We're funding some kind of science experiments in Ukraine, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=296.88000000000005s)]
*  no more questions from you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=299.14000000000004s)]
*  And the bill goes on like this, and on and on. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=300.82000000000005s)]
*  As Congressman Thomas Massey has pointed out, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=304.3s)]
*  Congress has now spent more money on Ukraine in six months [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=306.12s)]
*  than the US government spent on all roads and all bridges [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=309.62s)]
*  in the United States over all of last year. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  The $40 billion we're sending to Ukraine [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=316.22s)]
*  so they can secure their borders, by the way, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=318.26000000000005s)]
*  is more than double, more than double, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=320.42s)]
*  what Joe Biden has asked to fund customs [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=322.92s)]
*  and border security in the United States. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=325.18s)]
*  One bill, more than double what we're spending [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=328.44000000000005s)]
*  this year on our borders. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=331.1s)]
*  And then, in the middle of this historic drug emergency, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=333.42s)]
*  and it is, the bill spends more than 10 times [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=335.98s)]
*  the entire budget of the DEA. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=339.42s)]
*  More than 10 times. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=342.42s)]
*  Just in case you're wondering how your leaders [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=343.82000000000005s)]
*  feel about you, they're not fans at all. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=346.38s)]
*  And now we know for sure. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=348.02000000000004s)]
*  You should know that every single Democrat [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=350.02000000000004s)]
*  in the House of Representatives voted for this bill. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=352.14000000000004s)]
*  That would include even Barbara Lee of Berkeley. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=354.3s)]
*  Now, if you remember her name, it may be because in 2001, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=356.18s)]
*  Barbara Lee of Berkeley was the only member of Congress [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  to oppose the war against the Taliban. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=361.56s)]
*  But a war in Ukraine is a war that Barbara Lee can support. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=365.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=368.26s)]
*  Because there's no potential chance [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=369.1s)]
*  that war could help the United States. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=371.3s)]
*  Here's her reasoning. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=373.62s)]
*  This war is not only about Ukraine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=376.17999999999995s)]
*  This war is about the rest of the world [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=377.7s)]
*  and Putin trying to establish autocratic governments [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=380.02s)]
*  throughout the world. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=385.7s)]
*  And we know that this is taking place [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=387.06s)]
*  through disinformation campaigns, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=388.85999999999996s)]
*  through all kinds of misinformation that's taking place. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=391.58s)]
*  Oh, so it's not really about Ukraine. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=396.9s)]
*  It's about something bigger than Ukraine. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=400.12s)]
*  Thanks, Barbara Lee, for being dim enough to tell us that, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=401.94s)]
*  to say it out loud. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=404.62s)]
*  This is a war on disinformation, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=406.62s)]
*  which at some point in some way [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=409.36s)]
*  is dead certain to be a war on you. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=411.7s)]
*  No question about it, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=415.26s)]
*  because you're a font of disinformation, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=416.16s)]
*  meaning you disagree. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  But we know for certain that wars against things [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=420.32s)]
*  you can't really identify against people who don't exist, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=424.58s)]
*  wars against concepts, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=429.14s)]
*  one thing we know about those wars, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=430.6s)]
*  like the war on terror is they last forever. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=431.76s)]
*  So it was a little weird to see Tim Ryan [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=435.76s)]
*  of Ohio vote for this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=437.92s)]
*  Tim Ryan was supposed to be a working man's Democrat, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=439.24s)]
*  a guy who cares about bread and butter issues. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=442.08s)]
*  Tim Ryan represents Youngstown and Akron. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=446.02s)]
*  Take a look at Akron sometime. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=449.12s)]
*  It's like a war zone itself. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=451.7s)]
*  These are the cities that built America, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=454.2s)]
*  crumbling and desperate now from total neglect. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=456.12s)]
*  But don't you worry. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=460.12s)]
*  Tim Ryan is totally committed to rebuilding Kiev. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=462.4s)]
*  And so is Nancy Pelosi. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=464.88s)]
*  For Pelosi, funding Ukraine at any cost [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=466.36s)]
*  is more than a foreign policy objective. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=470.08s)]
*  It's a kind of religious observance. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=472.2s)]
*  The brutality of Putin is not just what he's doing in Ukraine, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=474.68s)]
*  but the impact that it is having on food for the world. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=478.76s)]
*  So when you're home thinking, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=484.0s)]
*  what is this all about? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=486.08s)]
*  Just think about when I was hungry, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=487.6s)]
*  you fed me in the gospel of Matthew. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=490.92s)]
*  Oh, so Jesus wants to send more missiles to Ukraine. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=495.16s)]
*  And the more missiles we send to Ukraine, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=500.0s)]
*  the less hungry people are gonna be. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  Wouldn't Jesus wanna do everything possible [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=505.6s)]
*  to bring an end to the war in Ukraine? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=508.64000000000004s)]
*  You're religious little twit. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=511.32000000000005s)]
*  How dare you quote that book. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=512.64s)]
*  By the way, there was a time when Nancy Pelosi [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=514.64s)]
*  didn't wanna spend billions of dollars [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=516.28s)]
*  to secure a country's border. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  She said it was wasteful and morally wrong. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=519.72s)]
*  It wasn't that long ago, by the way, it was April of 2017. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=522.04s)]
*  See if you notice the difference. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=525.04s)]
*  She's for spending billions of borders now. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=526.72s)]
*  She was opposed to it then. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=528.88s)]
*  What changed? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=530.68s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=531.52s)]
*  The wall is, in my view, immoral, expensive, unwise. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=532.8399999999999s)]
*  And when the president says, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=537.68s)]
*  well, I promised a wall during my campaign, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=539.36s)]
*  I don't think he said he was gonna pass [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=541.76s)]
*  billions of dollars of cost of the wall onto the taxpayer. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=544.12s)]
*  Oh, did you catch that? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=548.8s)]
*  Border security in the United States is immoral. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=549.84s)]
*  But Jesus is strongly for border security in Ukraine, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=552.96s)]
*  and abortion, by the way. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=555.6s)]
*  It's a sacrament. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=556.84s)]
*  As usual, Democrats, as Ludacris, as this may sound, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  are united on this point. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=560.8s)]
*  They stand as one. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=562.88s)]
*  But also as usual, a stained propaganda campaign [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=563.96s)]
*  in the American media has managed to divide [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=568.04s)]
*  the Republican party. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=570.32s)]
*  Now, why does this happen every single time? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=572.32s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=574.32s)]
*  Because Republican officeholders, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  no matter how conservative they tell you they are, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=577.0s)]
*  believe the New York Times. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=579.36s)]
*  They care deeply what legacy media say. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=581.2s)]
*  They read the New York Times every day. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=584.2800000000001s)]
*  They don't wanna be criticized by the New York Times. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=585.44s)]
*  And that's how the left controls them every single time. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  If you don't believe it, think back the last two years. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=592.2s)]
*  You saw the same dynamic in the early days [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=594.2s)]
*  of both the BLM riots and the COVID lockdowns. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=596.1600000000001s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi was out there first, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  taking the most extreme possible position. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=601.16s)]
*  And then a lot of Republican leaders agreed with her. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  Two years ago this month, Nikki Haley, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=609.66s)]
*  former governor of South Carolina, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=611.1s)]
*  running for president, she's conservative. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=612.7199999999999s)]
*  She told Americans in the first days of the riots [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=614.52s)]
*  that they deserved to suffer after George Floyd died. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=617.0s)]
*  Quote, in order to heal, it needs to be personal [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=620.0s)]
*  and painful for everyone, she wrote. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=623.36s)]
*  And in the end, it was personal and painful. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=625.28s)]
*  A lot of people died. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=626.88s)]
*  And that was good because your racism killed George Floyd. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=628.72s)]
*  That was Nikki Haley's first reaction. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=632.76s)]
*  She read it in the New York Times [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=635.36s)]
*  and she believed that they all do. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=636.28s)]
*  So it shouldn't shock you that Nikki Haley's [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=637.86s)]
*  first reaction to the Russia invasion [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=639.36s)]
*  and Mitch McConnell's first reaction too, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=641.28s)]
*  and the first reaction of so many other Republican leaders [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=643.12s)]
*  was that protecting Ukraine is way more important [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=645.82s)]
*  than protecting you than protecting America. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=648.32s)]
*  And Mitch McConnell hasn't, to his credit, moved from that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=650.96s)]
*  He still thinks it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=653.5600000000001s)]
*  Here he was yesterday. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=655.2s)]
*  I think we all agree the most important thing [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=657.04s)]
*  going on in the world right now is the war in Ukraine. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=660.64s)]
*  I had a chance to call the president last week [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=664.74s)]
*  and request that the Ukraine package [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=667.2s)]
*  move by itself and quickly. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=670.76s)]
*  He said, let me think it over. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=675.76s)]
*  He called back in about 15 minutes [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=677.2s)]
*  and agreed that we need to do this Ukraine only [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=679.88s)]
*  and quickly. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=686.72s)]
*  I think we're on the path to getting that done. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  You got to hope that there's some sincere billionaire [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=691.5600000000001s)]

*  standing behind Mitch McConnell, as he said, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  and we'll quote again, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=701.48s)]
*  I think we all agree the most important thing [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=702.76s)]
*  going on in the world right now is the war in Ukraine. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=705.12s)]
*  No, the most important thing going on in the world right now [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=708.2s)]
*  is the state of your country, the one you're supposed to run, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=711.28s)]
*  the people you're supposed to represent, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=715.0s)]
*  whose lives you're supposed to care about, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=716.4s)]
*  the ones who can't buy food or gas, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=717.98s)]
*  the people ODing on fentanyl, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=719.8s)]
*  107,000 in a year dead young people, Americans. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=722.04s)]
*  But that's nothing compared to Ukraine. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=728.36s)]
*  We all agree Ukraine is the most important thing. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=729.56s)]
*  Really, if you agree with that, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=732.0s)]
*  you should not be sitting in the United States Senate [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=733.08s)]
*  as a Republican, and yet that's their position. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=735.84s)]
*  Of course, it's Lindsey Graham's position, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=739.16s)]
*  just to give you yet another example. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=740.88s)]
*  If Putin's still standing after all this, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=743.64s)]
*  then the world's going to be a very dark place. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=746.32s)]
*  China's going to get the wrong signal, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=748.5600000000001s)]
*  and we'll have a mess on our hands [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=750.6s)]
*  in Europe for decades to come. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=752.08s)]
*  So let's take out Putin by helping Ukraine. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  All right, so you're saying that that's how this ends, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=756.34s)]
*  that Putin is removed? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=758.26s)]
*  Is there any way ... [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=760.5600000000001s)]
*  There's no offer. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=761.6s)]

*  He's afraid we could spend the next hour [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=772.84s)]

*  and resulted only in the death of American servicemen [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=778.86s)]
*  and the impoverishment of the United States. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=782.0s)]
*  He's gotten it wrong every single time, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=784.0s)]

*  Let's just take out Putin. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=787.44s)]
*  Really, what would happen then? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=788.58s)]
*  The country has 6,000 nuclear weapons. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=789.48s)]

*  gentleman from Maryland is recognized. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=981.96s)]
*  Thank you, Madam Speaker. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=983.94s)]
*  Here's a formula for the destruction of democracy, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=985.38s)]
*  repeating Putin's propaganda and disinformation [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=988.62s)]
*  and appeasing imperialist assaults on sovereign nations. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=991.86s)]
*  So you can't buy baby formula in the United States [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=997.5s)]
*  and maybe you think you can do both at once. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1000.38s)]
*  You can fund Ukraine and get baby formula [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1002.54s)]
*  for American babies. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1006.3399999999999s)]
*  Maybe you can fix inflation and also fund Ukraine. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1007.5s)]
*  Speak slowly and tell us how that works. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1011.5s)]
*  Maybe there's an answer to the question, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1013.5799999999999s)]
*  but notice they don't answer. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1015.18s)]
*  They just accused the person asking the question [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1017.54s)]
*  of working for Putin. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1020.26s)]
*  You're working for Putin, you're against democracy. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1022.26s)]
*  They don't tell us how Ukraine is a democracy. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1024.8999999999999s)]
*  They banned the opposition party, that's a democracy. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1026.6599999999999s)]
*  But maybe there's an answer. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1029.86s)]
*  What is it? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1031.2s)]
*  Stop name calling and answer the question. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1032.04s)]
*  But Jamie Raskin won't do that, none of them will. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1035.28s)]
*  He screams about Putin. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1038.22s)]
*  Now 57 Republicans did vote against last night's bill [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1040.1s)]
*  and God bless them for doing it, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1043.3999999999999s)]
*  but many more voted for it. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1045.3999999999999s)]
*  Of course there was Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1047.08s)]
*  and their friend Elise Stefanik. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1050.48s)]
*  But there was also Republican leadership, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1052.6s)]
*  top leadership, McCarthy and Scalise, shameful. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1055.8999999999999s)]
*  And the worst part is this bill [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1060.44s)]
*  will almost certainly pass in the Senate, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1061.54s)]
*  which is way more left-wing even than the House [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1063.34s)]
*  on the Republican side. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1066.1s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is promising a swift vote on it. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1067.3799999999999s)]
*  That means as soon as tomorrow. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1069.78s)]
*  So we reached out to every Republican in the Senate [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1071.46s)]
*  to find out what they plan to do. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1074.08s)]
*  Most of them didn't bother to reply, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1075.34s)]
*  none of them will come on the show. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1076.8s)]
*  That would include Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1078.3799999999999s)]
*  Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Chuck Grassley, Mitt Romney [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1081.78s)]
*  also did not respond. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1084.2s)]
*  We're hoping they'll vote the right way. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1085.22s)]
*  But a handful of senators did respond [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1087.2s)]
*  and we wanna let you know where they stand. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1088.86s)]
*  Voting no will be Mike Braun, Roger Marshall, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1090.28s)]
*  Marshall Blackburn, Bill Haggerty and Josh Hawley. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1092.8s)]
*  Rand Paul has also indicated he's opposed the bill. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1095.64s)]
*  He wouldn't say so, but of course he's against it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1097.56s)]
*  Lindsey Graham needs to say, is he yes? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1099.56s)]
*  He's thrilled. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1101.24s)]
*  As his office put it, Senator Graham has made it clear [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1102.4s)]
*  he supports additional military aid to Ukraine [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1104.52s)]
*  because it makes him feel so good inside. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1106.92s)]
*  He didn't say that, but that's the truth. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1109.12s)]
*  Rob Portman of Ohio is leaving Thank Heaven, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1111.44s)]
*  he's also a yes. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1113.52s)]
*  So is Steve Danes of Montana. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1114.58s)]
*  Quote, the Senator is leading yes, his office said. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1116.16s)]
*  They also told us that Danes thinks Russian oligarchs [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1118.52s)]
*  somehow will pay the 40 billion. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1121.4s)]
*  Quote, he wants to make Russia cover the costs. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1123.72s)]
*  He wants to use the seized assets of oligarchs [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1126.48s)]
*  to cover the costs. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1128.96s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1130.52s)]
*  A few senators, Dodge, Pat Toomey, Tim Scott, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1132.02s)]
*  Cindy Hyde Smith, all refused to give us a direct answer. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1134.56s)]
*  We wanna invite any Republican Senator [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1137.2s)]
*  who plans on voting for this to come on the show [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1139.4s)]
*  and explain why. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1141.96s)]
*  Please tell us, we'll let you talk as much as you want. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1142.78s)]
*  We're not gonna sandbag you. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1145.04s)]
*  We wanna know why this is in America's interest, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1146.1399999999999s)]
*  why this is more important [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1148.6999999999998s)]
*  than the pressing crises all around us [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1149.9799999999998s)]
*  that the rest of us notice and apparently you don't. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1151.8999999999999s)]
*  So tell us, you're always welcome. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDfMfV7Zf0&t=1153.6599999999999s)]
