# Watters: Why is the White House doing this to Biden?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. I'm Jesse Waters and for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=0.0s)]
*  Tucker, we've learned a lot about Joe Biden in the last year. For one, we know [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=4.62s)]
*  he's not the same old Scranton Joe that represented Delaware in the Senate for [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=9.36s)]
*  decades or the old tough guy Joe, who saved the day by fighting off corn pop. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=13.88s)]
*  He's not even the same Joe Biden who was Barack Obama's vice president. That Joe [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Biden is gone and he's been gone for a while. In 2021, Biden confirmed what [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=23.48s)]
*  many of us could see during the presidential campaign. He is decaying. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=29.2s)]
*  That is not an attack on Biden. He's nearly 80 years old. Anyone who's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=33.9s)]
*  watched Joe Biden can see it. It's a fact we take no pleasure in stating [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=38.04s)]
*  nobody is happy when the president United States stumbles over his words [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  or forgets where he is. We don't enjoy watching him fall asleep in the middle [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=47.04s)]
*  of an overseas summit, but his decline is hard to ignore. His latest example [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  came just last night in an interview with ABC News. Joe Biden struggled to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=56.96s)]
*  remember the name of the latest covid variant called Omicron. But maybe that's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=61.6s)]
*  not exactly a surprise since Joe Biden also told us he didn't even see [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=66.52s)]
*  Omicron coming. The vice president said in recent days that that you didn't see [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=71.44s)]
*  delta coming. You didn't see Omicron coming. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=76.48s)]
*  How did you get it wrong? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=80.56s)]
*  Yeah, how did we get it wrong? Nobody saw it coming. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=82.38s)]
*  Nobody in the whole world who saw it coming. The Omicron variant has been [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=87.28s)]
*  around for weeks. The World Health Organization announced its existence in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=91.48s)]
*  late November, and the U. S. Government designated it as a concern days later. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=95.7s)]
*  But somehow Joe Biden missed all of that. If the president of the United [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=101.08s)]
*  States acknowledging he was completely unaware of the incoming covid variants [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=104.68s)]
*  wasn't bad enough, Biden then confused coronavirus tests with pills. He sounded [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  like he had no idea what he was talking about, as he frequently does. And then [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  he told us the lack of available coronavirus tests for the variant. He [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=119.92s)]
*  also tells us we're supposed to be scared of isn't a failure. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=123.92s)]
*  You told the american people just yesterday that we are prepared for [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=129.56s)]
*  what's coming. But three days before Christmas, if you look out across the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=133.28s)]
*  country, you see it everywhere. These long lines, people waiting for hours [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=137.46s)]
*  outside in the cold just to get tested empty shelves, no test kits. Is that a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=141.1s)]
*  failure? No, I don't think it's a failure. I think it's you could argue [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=145.34s)]
*  that we should have known a year ago, six months ago, two months ago, a month [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=149.74s)]
*  ago. I've ordered half a billion of the pills, 500 million pills. I'm [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=154.06s)]
*  assuming 500 million test kits that are gonna be available to be sent to every [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=160.22s)]
*  home in America if anybody wants them. But the answer is, yeah, I wish I had [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=165.06s)]
*  thought about ordering a half a billion pills two months ago before covid hit [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=170.18s)]
*  here. That is who has the final say on public health in this country. A man [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=174.54s)]
*  who can't differentiate between tests and pills or delta and Omicron. The same [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=179.86s)]
*  joe biden who told us earlier this year, vaccines prevent transmission quote, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=184.66s)]
*  You're not gonna get covid if you have these vaccinations, unquote. That's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=189.18s)]
*  who's at the helm. Americans expect the leader of the free world to inspire [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=195.26s)]
*  confidence heading into the new year. Instead, joe biden confessed that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=199.22s)]
*  nothing has been good enough. And in what was likely his last interview [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=203.3s)]
*  before millions of americans hope to gather for Christmas, joe biden told the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=207.48s)]
*  country that only vaccinated americans are permitted to celebrate one of our [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=211.4s)]
*  nation's most sacred holidays. We're nearly two years into this pandemic. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=216.1s)]
*  You're a year into the presidency, empty shelves and no test kits in some [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=220.62s)]
*  places three days before Christmas when it's so important. Is that good enough? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=224.94s)]
*  No, nothing has been good enough. But look, look who we are. If you are tested, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=231.54s)]
*  if you know where you are in terms of having gotten the shots, there's no [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=236.46s)]
*  reason why you can't get together with your family and your friends. Um, and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=240.34s)]
*  we couldn't do that last Christmas. If we learned anything new about joe biden [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  last night, it's this a year of failures and errors on everything from the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  economy to lockdowns and mandates. The border and Afghanistan have all taken [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=252.98s)]
*  their toll. Joe biden is completely dejected and he knows it. And if there [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=258.46s)]
*  was ever any doubt about biden's health or cognitive ability, he put that all [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  the rest yesterday. Biden actually admitted his own health was a legitimate [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=270.16s)]
*  question. We don't have to guess anymore. Joe biden says his health could [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=274.68s)]
*  prevent him from running for reelection in 2024. I want to ask you about [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  something I asked weeks before the election. When we sat down, you said you [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=285.54s)]
*  would absolutely serve eight years if elected. Do you plan to run for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=289.8s)]
*  reelection? Yes. But look, I'm a great respecter of fate. Fate has intervened [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=293.76s)]
*  in my life many, many times. If I'm in the health I'm in now, if I'm in good [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=300.56s)]
*  health, then in fact I would run again. And if that means a rematch against [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=306.02s)]
*  Donald Trump, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=310.26s)]
*  you're trying to tempt me now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=312.46s)]
*  Sure. Why would I not run against Donald Trump? Even the nominee that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=315.46s)]
*  increased the prospect of running. We can think of any other time where a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=319.12s)]
*  president is speculated about the decline of his own health. What's worse [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=323.46s)]
*  is Joe Biden thinks his current state is the definition of good health, but he [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  isn't fooling anybody. We see it. The american people see it and surely his [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=333.18s)]
*  staff sees it too. It's why they usually keep him on a very tight script. He's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=337.78s)]
*  only allowed to speak to reporters when they give him permission. He hardly [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=343.34s)]
*  gives any interviews and last night showed exactly why Joe biden can't [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=347.38s)]
*  speak without embarrassing himself and his own administration. The White House [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=351.56s)]
*  knows all of that and yet they send him out anyway. Why? Because his opportunist [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=355.76s)]
*  handlers who helped make him the president want you to know he's inept. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  They want to make it clear Joe Biden's not running things and that they're the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  ones with the real power. They're trying to accelerate the argument that he [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=371.76s)]
*  needs to be replaced. CNN put it very clearly in a headline this week. Quote, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=375.76s)]
*  the 11 Democrats who could replace Joe Biden in 2024. What's interesting is [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  that even other Democrats are being challenged about Joe Biden's ability to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  lead. Kamala Harris was asked about this just a few days ago and she pretended [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=391.44s)]
*  to be very angry. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=396.52s)]
*  So who's the real president of this country? Is it Joe Manchin or Joe Biden? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=399.64s)]
*  Madam Vice President? Come on, Charlemagne. I really it's Joe. But I [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=403.44s)]
*  can't tell. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's Joe Biden and don't start [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=407.28s)]
*  talking like a Republican about asking whether or not he's president. Do you [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  think Joe Manchin is a problem? And it's Joe and it's Joe and it's Joe Biden [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=417.44s)]
*  and I'm vice president. My name is Kamala Harris. Did you notice how Kamala [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=421.09999999999997s)]
*  had to state that she was vice vice president almost like she needed to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=425.96s)]
*  remind us? That's because Kamala Harris is an afterthought. She was an [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  afterthought in the primaries when she was the first Democrat to drop out of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=434.52000000000004s)]
*  the running. Nobody liked her then and we know with certainty nobody likes [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=438.04s)]
*  her now. Her approval rating is less than 30% and her staffers can't quit [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=442.8s)]
*  fast enough. So this is the state of the country and the Democratic Party after [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=447.6s)]
*  Joe Biden's first year in office. It's a very chaotic Christmas and there's no [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=453.04s)]
*  leader to be found. One year down, three to go. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52G56dHMBc&t=457.64000000000004s)]
