# Shocking details of Marjorie Taylor Greene’s visit to Jan. 6 defendants in prison
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g)
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is one of the very few members of Congress who cares at all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=0.0s)]
*  She just led a delegation to the jail where many of these defendants are now being held. She joins [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  us now with a report on what she saw. Congresswoman, thank you so much for coming on for doing this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=8.88s)]
*  So what was your impression of the conditions that these protesters are being held in? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=13.76s)]
*  Well, I think what we all saw was a big cover-up. You see, I've been in that jail before and I know [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  what it looks like. I was there back in late 2021 when myself along with Louie Gohmert were the only [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=24.88s)]
*  ones to go into the jail and see the conditions that the pretrial January 6 defendants were being [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  in, being held in. And it was so horrific that we wrote a report called Unusually Cruel that's still [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=37.36s)]
*  on my congressional website today. Well, we finally were allowed to go back in after demanding another [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=43.36s)]
*  visit from the mayor's office for over a year. We went in with the oversight committee and what we [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=49.2s)]
*  found is they had scrubbed the jail clean, cleaned up all the mold and freshly painted the entire [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=55.84s)]
*  area so that it looked a lot better. Well, I got to tell you, Tucker, it fooled the Democrats, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=61.52s)]
*  Robert Garcia and Jasmine Crockett that came along with us because they praised the jail after we [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=65.68s)]
*  left in their press conferences and praised the warden. But I guess since they're so new in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=71.04s)]
*  Congress, they didn't know the history that this jail has and how many Democrats in Washington [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=76.48s)]
*  don't like the jail either. I mean, the fact that anybody is being held without even a trial yet [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  over two years later is shocking to the conscience. Did the Democrats and the delegation seem stunned [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=88.0s)]
*  by that? It doesn't seem like an American thing to do. No, they didn't care at all. As a matter of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  fact, they criticize us for talking with the pretrial January 6 defendants and being friendly [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=97.84s)]
*  with them. But you know what? We would have talked to the other inmates and defendants that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=103.2s)]
*  were in the jail in other areas if they had given us a chance. You see, it was interesting, the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=107.44s)]
*  director and all of the employees at the jail, they wouldn't let us talk to anyone else in the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=112.0s)]
*  jail. Only the pretrial January 6 defendants, which I found very disturbing because I want [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=116.16s)]
*  oversight of the entire jail. But other things that I found that really bothered me and I think [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=121.76s)]
*  it should bother everyone and we as Republicans have to do something about it is the medical [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=126.56s)]
*  director in the jail showed off and bragged about all of her medical services and treatments that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=132.0s)]
*  they can provide in the jail. But when we talked to the pretrial January 6 defendants, they told [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=137.84s)]
*  us they were receiving no medical treatments for problems and health problems that they have. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=142.8s)]
*  Even one man in there with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, he has cancer and he doesn't get any treatment [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=147.12s)]
*  there. It's really an atrocity. I don't think you need to be Republican or a Democrat to care about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=153.52s)]
*  civil liberties and human rights and really appreciate your calling attention to this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=157.68s)]
*  consistently over the years. Margie Taylor Green, thank you. Yeah, thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Aj5NHDx-g&t=161.28s)]
