# What does an all-ages drag brunch look like?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY)
*  Now, to be clear, kids were there because organizers wanted kids to be there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=0.0s)]
*  On your screen, you're seeing an event page from bestdragshows.com that advertises tickets [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=5.5s)]
*  for an upcoming event in November. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=9.66s)]
*  The bottom of the flyer says that minors are allowed if accompanied by a parent or guardian. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=11.26s)]
*  Now, apparently this is not a crime in the state of Texas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=16.0s)]
*  It's certainly a huge moral crime that nobody should accept. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=18.8s)]
*  You're not tolerant if you accept this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=23.16s)]
*  Sexualizing children is totally wrong. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=26.02s)]
*  It's the most wrong thing of all, and it just shows how totally passive and out of it the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=27.58s)]
*  rest of us are that we haven't acknowledged that and done something about it, actually [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  done something about it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=34.04s)]
*  Sarah Gonzalez has done something about it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=35.8s)]
*  She works at Blaze TV. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  Sarah, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  I mean, am I misreading this? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=41.64s)]
*  I can't even say the lyrics on TV. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=45.0s)]
*  I don't think I'm prudent in any sense, but there are kids there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Like what? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you're not misreading it, Tucker. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  And I would also say there was a later part of the event where they were handing out sex [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=52.12s)]
*  toys as prizes for contest winners. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=56.02s)]
*  So this is something that was overtly sexual. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=59.02s)]
*  They clearly said all ages welcome. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=61.78s)]
*  And now apparently the left is gaslighting me into into thinking that I'm somehow the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=63.7s)]
*  crazy one for having a problem with this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=68.66s)]
*  And, you know, it's interesting, Tucker, because the excuse that they always use is, well, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=70.66s)]
*  I thought you guys were the party of parental rights. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=74.42s)]
*  And if you don't like it, just don't take your kid. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=77.02s)]
*  Parental rights does not apply to child abuse. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=79.62s)]
*  This is clear child abuse. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=83.06s)]
*  This is the sexual abuse of children, which we used to the left and the right. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=84.8s)]
*  We used to be able to agree was a really, really bad thing and we can't do it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=88.24s)]
*  But the left has become so radicalized that they are trying to normalize this and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=92.16s)]
*  excuse it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=96.44s)]
*  So what about GLAD and Equal Rights Campaign and these hugely well-funded gay [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=98.28s)]
*  rights groups that kind of existed to push for gay marriage? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=102.88s)]
*  They got it. Great. But are they on board with this? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is such a moral atrocity. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=108.72s)]
*  It's hard to believe that adults are for it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=111.32s)]
*  But they are. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=114.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think that there is a subsector of adults within these organizations that are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=116.26s)]
*  not maybe don't agree with it, but they don't have the courage to speak up. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=121.9s)]
*  They're scared of being canceled. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=125.58s)]
*  And my message to them is you have to be on the right side of history here, because [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=127.5s)]
*  eventually we will win out and you don't want to be caught on the wrong side or, you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=131.16s)]
*  know, excusing this behavior. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  It's absolutely inexcusable. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=138.22s)]
*  And anyone who does not stand up and speak out about it is just as culpable, quite [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=139.78s)]
*  frankly, Republican or Democrat. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=143.58s)]
*  Well, I don't I don't even understand. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=146.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe I'm just dumb. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=147.72s)]
*  But why would you want to get kids involved? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  And we had this pretty fair deal where people, you know, you go do your thing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  I'll do my thing. I mean, that that's been the case in this country for the 50 years [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  I've been here. And all of a sudden it's like, no, we have to get kids involved. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  What? I mean, why? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=162.12s)]
*  Why would you want kids involved? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I believe, Tucker, that it's a more sinister attempt by the left to, you [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=165.84s)]
*  know, they they want this radical country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=170.64s)]
*  The only way that they can achieve that is through complete chaos and confusion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=172.38s)]
*  And what is the best way to confuse children, confuse them about their sexuality, confuse [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  them about their gender, expose them to things that their little brains are not ready for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=180.05999999999997s)]
*  yet. That is how they are confusing children. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=183.98s)]
*  It is leading to chaos. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=186.38s)]
*  And Big Daddy government, of course, can be there to pick us all up and take care of us [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=187.73999999999998s)]
*  at the end of it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  It's just beyond belief. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=193.98s)]
*  You can't get kids involved in your creepy sex stuff. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=195.54s)]
*  Period. It's not. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=198.61999999999998s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  And I appreciate you bringing this to light. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  Sarah Gonzalez, thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrdJ3_4VUY&t=202.88000000000002s)]
