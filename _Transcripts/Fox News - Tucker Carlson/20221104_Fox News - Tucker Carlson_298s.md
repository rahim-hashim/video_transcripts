# JD Vance: This is why the left believes I’m a ‘threat to democracy’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM)
*  JD Vance is running for Senate from the state of Ohio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=0.0s)]
*  We have been told repeatedly his election [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=3.7s)]
*  would be the end of democracy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=5.62s)]
*  We thought we'd check that claim with him now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=6.98s)]
*  JD Vance, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=8.8s)]
*  So how is it in a system designed to serve the desires [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=10.14s)]
*  and needs of the public that an election outcome [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=13.92s)]
*  that the people in charge don't like [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=16.36s)]
*  is the end of the system? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=17.7s)]
*  Isn't it in fact a heartwarming, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=18.66s)]
*  a heartwarming piece of evidence that the system works? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=22.18s)]
*  Yeah, Tucker, so when people say that our democracy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=26.9s)]
*  is under threat, what they typically mean is that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=30.74s)]
*  people who are actually gonna challenge the establishment [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=33.22s)]
*  might get an opportunity to govern, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=35.9s)]
*  which is exactly what I think is gonna happen in our race [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=37.58s)]
*  and in a number of other races in about five days, Tucker. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=39.82s)]
*  You know, one of the crazy things [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=42.92s)]
*  and one of the really big ways in which the Democrats [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=44.459999999999994s)]
*  and the establishment really suppress [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=47.2s)]
*  anti-establishment candidates is by flooding the zone [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=49.54s)]
*  with a ton of money. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=52.94s)]
*  And so I'm running against Democrat Tim Ryan, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=54.26s)]
*  who has this tech-backed fundraising platform [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=56.86s)]
*  on which he's raised $65 million. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=60.82s)]
*  That's somehow not a threat to democracy [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=64.26s)]
*  when the technology industry promotes Tim Ryan's fundraising [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=66.58s)]
*  and when they suppress information related [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=69.9s)]
*  to our race and others, but it is a threat to democracy [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=72.3s)]
*  when the people vote for who they want to vote for anyway. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=75.08s)]
*  It's ridiculous, it doesn't make any sense, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=78.22s)]
*  and it's why, Tucker, people need to get out there and vote. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  They need to go to JDVance.com and help us out. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=83.54s)]
*  They need to not listen to the censors and to the warnings [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  because you're right, we are a free people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=90.56s)]
*  and we need to let people know that on November the 8th. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=92.58000000000001s)]
*  If you believed in democracy, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=95.9s)]
*  then you would want each congressional district [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=97.58000000000001s)]
*  or in a statewide race like yours, each state, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=99.94s)]
*  to get the representatives who most closely mirrored [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  the views of the people they represent, correct? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=104.22s)]
*  But Tim Ryan, who represented Youngstown, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=106.66000000000001s)]
*  which is a bunch of conservative Democrats, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=108.94000000000001s)]
*  has moved way left, way left, like crazy left, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=110.72s)]
*  at the behest of his donors. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=113.72s)]
*  How is that democracy? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's not democracy at all, Tucker. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=118.7s)]
*  In fact, it's oligarchy, and Tim Ryan [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=120.2s)]
*  is sort of the poster board for oligarchy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=122.0s)]
*  If you look at his views on green energy, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=124.08s)]
*  really good for the people who fund his campaign, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=126.58s)]
*  really bad for the people of Youngstown, Ohio. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=129.32s)]
*  If you look at his views on, for example, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=131.88s)]
*  flooding America with illegal aliens [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=133.92s)]
*  and then using American tax dollars [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=136.2s)]
*  to fund gender reassignment surgeries for those aliens, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=138.76s)]
*  that's exactly what Tim Ryan has proposed doing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=141.84s)]
*  You realize that this is, again, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=145.16s)]
*  this is not about letting the will of the people [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=146.76s)]
*  determine elections. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=149.88s)]
*  That's not why people are threatening. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  That's not why they're warning. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  That's not why they're censoring. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=154.7s)]
*  The will of the people is to get back to common sense. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  The will of the people is to get back [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=159.28s)]
*  to low inflation economic policies, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=160.64s)]
*  to secure our border and to get our streets under control. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=162.92s)]
*  That's democracy in action, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  and that's a great thing, Tucker. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=167.4s)]
*  That's not what they're offer. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  They're offer the donor class of the Democratic Party [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=170.44s)]
*  continuing to control what Democrats say [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=173.36s)]
*  and what ultimately happens in our government, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  but I don't think we're gonna let that happen anymore. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=178.36s)]
*  Five days, Tucker, is when we send a big message. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=180.56s)]
*  That's not how it works in this country any longer. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, last question, JD Vance, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=185.88s)]
*  maybe the last time we speak before the election, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  and Godspeed, of course, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  but you were a bestselling author and a businessman. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=191.02s)]
*  You really didn't need this job. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  Big pay cut, a lot of hassle for your family. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=195.76s)]
*  You did it anyway [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=198.0s)]
*  because you wanted to be a citizen legislator. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  There are a lot of candidates, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=201.94s)]
*  a cycle on the Republican side [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=203.2s)]
*  who did exactly the same thing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  Isn't that what a democracy is supposed to produce? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=205.6s)]
*  And yet you're attacked as a threat to democracy? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=209.28s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=211.84s)]
*  Well, it's because I'm not a threat to democracy, Tucker. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm a threat to the existing power structure [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  in this country that we have to remember [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=219.84s)]
*  has gotten rich by shipping our industrial base to China [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=221.7s)]
*  and has thrown a set of values in our schools, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=224.92s)]
*  even in our military, onto the American people [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  that the American people never asked for [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  and none of us actually want. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=233.68s)]
*  So we have to remember that offshoring and woke ideology [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=235.32s)]
*  and gender reassignment surgeries for nine-year-old kids, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=239.32s)]
*  that's all part of the same ruling class set of ideas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=242.54s)]
*  Those of us who are fighting back against it, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  and I certainly think that I'm not the only one, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  those of us who are fighting against it [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=251.92s)]
*  are doing what democracy demands of us, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=253.44s)]
*  which is taking the will of the people [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=256.4s)]
*  and translating it, hopefully, to effective public policy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=258.38s)]
*  that pushes back against the craziness. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=261.76s)]
*  It's not a threat to democracy, Tucker. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  It's the very realization of democracy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=265.44s)]
*  I think that our founding fathers gave us a great system, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=268.34s)]
*  but we have to fight for it and we have to preserve it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  And when people say that we're threatening democracy, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=274.36s)]
*  we just need to ignore them [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=277.48s)]
*  because the will of the people is democracy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=278.9s)]
*  and that's a great thing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=281.08s)]
*  Amen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=282.44s)]
*  Really, best of luck. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=283.64s)]
*  JD Vance, great to see you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=284.48s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWMubz9tXM&t=286.46s)]
