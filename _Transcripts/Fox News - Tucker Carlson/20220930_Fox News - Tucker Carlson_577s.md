# How are they going to prevent global nuclear war?: Will Cain
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI)
*  Olinya Air Base near Finland and it's the headquarters of Russia's Naval [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=0.0s)]
*  Reconnaissance Air Division. Now it normally houses heavy bombers and cruise [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=5.16s)]
*  missiles. It's an important staging ground for Russian military operations [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=9.68s)]
*  in Ukraine. On August 21st an Israeli intelligence firm ISI noticed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  something unusual at Olinya Air Base. Satellite imagery detected the quote [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=19.36s)]
*  unusual presence of four TU-160 Russian strategic bombers there on site. Now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=24.12s)]
*  these are strategic supersonic bombers that are designed to carry nuclear [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=30.16s)]
*  weapons. You're seeing the satellite images from Olinya Air Base on your [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=34.64s)]
*  screen right now. Then just days ago on September 25th Israeli intelligence [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=38.28s)]
*  spotted three more Russian strategic bombers at Olinya. These were TU-95 [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=44.08s)]
*  turboprops. They're one of the oldest nuclear capable missile platforms in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=48.64s)]
*  Russia's arsenal. So prior to August the Jerusalem Post reports there were no [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=53.24s)]
*  strategic bombers at Olinya. Now as of this week there are at least seven. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=57.96s)]
*  Ukraine is now well within the range of both bombers. In related news the deputy [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=63.64s)]
*  of head of Ukraine's intelligence just determined that there's a quote very [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=69.92s)]
*  high risk of imminent tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine. Now given all of this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=74.12s)]
*  every NATO country now needs to answer a very basic question. How are you going to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=79.96s)]
*  lower the temperature? How are you going to prevent global nuclear war? It's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  really the only question that matters. Our leaders though have no answer, none [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=90.16s)]
*  whatsoever. Instead of calming tensions in fact they seem to be deliberately [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  provoking Russia. Today Joe Biden once again accused Vladimir Putin of blowing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=100.52s)]
*  up his own pipeline. He also asked me earlier about the pipeline and let me say [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=105.96s)]
*  this. It was a deliberate act of sabotage and now the Russians are pumping out [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=113.28s)]
*  disinformation in the lives and at the appropriate moment when things calm down [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  we're gonna be sending divers down to find out exactly what happened. We don't [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=124.32s)]
*  know that yet exactly but we're not just don't listen to what Putin was saying. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=128.32s)]
*  What he's saying we know is not true. Okay don't listen to Putin. Should we [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=132.64s)]
*  then listen to Joe Biden? In February Biden said this quote if Russia invades [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  then there will no longer be a Nord Stream 2. We will bring it to an end and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  then the State Department Victoria Nuland she said the same thing she said [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=148.72s)]
*  quote if Russia invades Ukraine one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  forward. Now what's interesting is those threats reveal who has incentive for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=158.44s)]
*  Nord Stream 2 to come to an end. You see the reason our leaders would make those [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=164.6s)]
*  threats is because Nord Stream 2 helps Putin. There's no reason for him to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=169.04s)]
*  sacrifice his leverage over Europe by destroying his own pipeline. On the other [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  hand we all know who is capable of shutting down his own pipeline that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=178.64s)]
*  would be Joe Biden and the Keystone XL pipeline. Now look there are those in all [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=182.56s)]
*  fairness who say the following they say this is Russia's way bombing their own [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=187.76s)]
*  pipeline of constricting supply so that they can jack up global oil and gas [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=193.28s)]
*  prices and then in turn make more money on existing contracts with India and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=197.84s)]
*  China. But here's a question why blow up your own infrastructure? Why not you know [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=202.92s)]
*  just turn off the tap? In fact that's exactly what Vladimir Putin did just a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=208.6s)]
*  few weeks ago. He shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. There was no gas [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=214.72s)]
*  flowing through a pipeline that now he's being accused of bombing and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=220.24s)]
*  sabotaging in order to constrict the supply of oil and gas a supply of which [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=224.0s)]
*  none was flowing through Nord Stream 2. Now to be clear I don't know who is [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=229.48s)]
*  responsible for this I'm just trying to logically follow incentive and if the US [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=235.2s)]
*  or its allies sabotaged Russian pipelines it wouldn't be the first time [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=239.92s)]
*  in 1982 Ronald Reagan authorized the CIA to blow up a Siberian natural gas [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=244.44s)]
*  pipeline using software. So we American citizens before we march to a drumbeat [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=250.16s)]
*  directly into global nuclear war are entitled to answers. You know who else is [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=257.92s)]
*  entitled to answers? Climate activists. You'd think they'd take notice you'd [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=264.0s)]
*  think they'd ask questions. Why? Because the Nord Stream 2 leak caused more than [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=268.08s)]
*  300,000 metric tons of methane to enter the atmosphere. Sounds like a lot right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=273.24s)]
*  Here's how much according to Bloomberg. That's roughly quote the same climate [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=278.68s)]
*  impact over a 20-year period as the annual emissions from about 5.48 [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=283.8s)]
*  million US cars. But our leaders even our green energies are they're hoping we [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=289.2s)]
*  ignore all of this and if that's the plan it just might work because there's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=295.8s)]
*  so much going on it's hard to keep track. In what amount of do a crazy day [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=300.64s)]
*  that literally flew under the radar flew under the weather radar and the news [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=304.88s)]
*  cycle Russia attempted to annex parts of Ukraine and then in turn the US [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=309.56s)]
*  announced new sanctions on Russia. We're announcing new sanctions today as well [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=314.8s)]
*  that including new authorities to sanction anyone who provides political or [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=320.4s)]
*  economic support to Russia's fraud fraudulent territorial claims and I've [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=326.2s)]
*  been in close touch with our NATO allies who are united in our resolve to take on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=331.36s)]
*  his aggression. Once more let's dare to ask a few critical questions. Let's dare [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=336.44s)]
*  to critically think. Why would more sanctions deter Russia? The last seven [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  months of sanctions have led to blackouts and food shortages in Europe. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=346.84s)]
*  Meanwhile in Russia the ruble got stronger. Oh by the way our economy tanked. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=350.68s)]
*  History has shown in fact that from Japan to Syria to Russia sanctions don't [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  deter they provoke and maybe that's the goal. It's the only way to achieve [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=360.92s)]
*  regime change in Russia which is the stated goal of the Biden administration. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=365.92s)]
*  Remember Putin quote cannot remain in power. Joe Biden's words last March and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=371.04s)]
*  he means it. In April Russia and Ukraine had a tentative agreement to end this [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  war. Ukraine could have kept its territory. All they had to do was [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=382.35999999999996s)]
*  promise not to become a NATO member because NATO wants to remove Putin from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  power. But the Biden administration and the UK vetoed that deal. So again a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=390.4s)]
*  critical question. Is this really about keeping Ukraine safe or is it about [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  regime change in Russia? Even if that means starting a world war today if [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=400.88s)]
*  there was any doubt left the president of Ukraine settled that question. He [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=407.44s)]
*  signed Ukraine's quote expedited application to formally join NATO. It's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=410.8s)]
*  yet another slick well produced video from Kiev. Watch. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=415.8s)]
*  Now stop up. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=420.48s)]
*  Nice pan on the handheld camera. If Ukraine joins NATO that means world war [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=439.76s)]
*  under article five of the NATO chart charter. Millions die. Instead of trying [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=445.16s)]
*  to avoid that catastrophe. Our media though is telling us that is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  essentially inevitable. The New Yorker for example just published this [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=453.48s)]
*  assessment quote Fiona Hill an expert on Russia says that we are already [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  fighting in the third world war whether we want to acknowledge it or not. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=461.68s)]
*  Perhaps save for the whole nuclear holocaust over to NBC quote historian [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=465.64000000000004s)]
*  Michael Beschloss just compared Putin's Russia to Nazi Germany before the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=471.08000000000004s)]
*  start of the second world war. Why? Because Putin just announced that he's [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=474.92s)]
*  annexing territories into Russia. Ukrainian territories into Russia. Is [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=479.24s)]
*  that comparison fair Putin to Hitler? NATO thinks so. The foreign minister [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=484.88s)]
*  Poland just pledged that NATO countries will use nuclear weapons against Russia [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=490.88s)]
*  if Russia's strategic bombers carry out a first strike. He said it doesn't even [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  matter if Ukraine is in NATO or not. In Washington you will not find a [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=499.48s)]
*  politician in either party who disagrees on that point. They all believe that [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  defending Ukraine is worth risking Armageddon. Of course so does Lindsey [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=509.6s)]
*  Graham. He just also compared Putin to Hitler. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=515.44s)]
*  I hope we will also send a very clear signal here that we're going to have [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=519.76s)]
*  more aid in the if we do an omnibus in December which I hope we will to fund [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=525.96s)]
*  the government that will have a robust package of military support taking [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=529.76s)]
*  Ukraine into 2023. Have we learned nothing from the last century? What [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=534.52s)]
*  should we have learned that when it comes to bullies and crazy people who [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=539.64s)]
*  want to you know put the world under the thumb like Hitler we should believe [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  what they say we should stand up to them sooner rather than later. That was [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=548.96s)]
*  Republican Senator from South Carolina Lindsey Graham standing right next to [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=552.68s)]
*  him Democratic Senator from Connecticut Richard Blumenthal. Why is virtually [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfYNTky0iQI&t=555.68s)]
