# Air travel hell: What is Mayor Pete doing about airline crisis?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM)
*  So if you're going to have a country the size of a continent, and we do, thank heaven, you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=0.0s)]
*  need consistent and reliable air travel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  It's not a luxury, it's a necessity. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=8.36s)]
*  The economy depends on it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=10.44s)]
*  And yet under this administration, the network, the very delicate and functional network of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=12.72s)]
*  air travel that we've built up over nearly 100 years is falling apart. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=19.88s)]
*  Skywest Airlines is the biggest regional airline in the country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=24.44s)]
*  They've just announced they have a major pilot shortage. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=26.96s)]
*  They're planning to drop service in 29 different cities. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=29.04s)]
*  Southwest also just announced slashing flights in April and May because of staffing problems. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  It's not just staffing that has caused them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=36.6s)]
*  The VAX mandates didn't help at all. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=38.64s)]
*  This is all about to get much worse. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=41.56s)]
*  According to one aviation consulting firm, we're going to be short 20,000 pilots by the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=42.84s)]
*  end of this year. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=47.32s)]
*  Within just six years, we'll be short more than 60,000 pilots. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=48.32s)]
*  So we have a transportation department that works pretty much full-time on eliminating [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=51.44s)]
*  racist roads and other equity agenda items. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=55.2s)]
*  Mayor Pete, of course, runs it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=58.0s)]
*  Are they doing anything about this problem? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=59.28s)]
*  Jason Rantz is a radio show host. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=61.56s)]
*  He joins us tonight with a report. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=63.04s)]
*  Hey, Jason. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=64.76s)]
*  Hey, Tucker. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=65.76s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=66.76s)]
*  The airline industry is crumbling and Pete Buttigieg is lecturing us about racist highways, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=67.76s)]
*  which kind of makes sense if you're a Green New Deal evangelist who doesn't actually want [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=72.88s)]
*  us flying much, which is exactly what he's getting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=76.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands of flights are being canceled. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=79.28s)]
*  Thousands a week are being delayed, making travel extremely difficult, especially in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=82.0s)]
*  some of the smaller cities that you would think Pete Buttigieg might pay attention to. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Good luck flying from North Texas to Louisville on Southwest Airlines. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Some day flights were just cut. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=94.4s)]
*  American Airlines slashed about 7 percent of its schedule this month. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=96.4s)]
*  Alaska, Allegiant 5 percent, United for the year, is gutting some 20,000 flights, largely [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=100.04s)]
*  due to a staffing shortage from the COVID vaccine mandate, certainly one that was made [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=106.38s)]
*  worse as a result. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=111.72s)]
*  Airlines were downplaying all those terminations. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=113.36s)]
*  People, reporters, frankly, supported the mandate, so they never did much digging. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=116.52s)]
*  But as of January, there were 31,000 fewer full-time airline workers than before COVID. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=118.64s)]
*  And while we were told pretty much everyone was complying, it turns out a lot of people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=125.74s)]
*  were also quitting or retiring early. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=129.56s)]
*  It's gotten so bad that JetBlue is basically begging flight attendants to take on some [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=132.36s)]
*  open shifts. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=136.44s)]
*  Alaska Airlines is paying double to take on extra work. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=137.44s)]
*  But it was the number of retiring pilots that is the most alarming. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=140.84s)]
*  Obviously, no flights means no pilots means no flights. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=144.72s)]
*  Alaska cut flights from Portland to Denver. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=147.6s)]
*  United cut from Dulles to pretty much a bunch of destinations. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=150.24s)]
*  And what you mentioned with SkyWest, they're looking to cut federally subsidized routes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=153.52s)]
*  that connect small cities to larger hubs so folks can actually get places. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=157.4s)]
*  They're not profitable because the customer base is too small, so the Department of Transportation [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=161.64s)]
*  subsidized it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=166.52s)]
*  But what we're seeing are serious service impacts and threats of losing flights to cities [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=168.06s)]
*  like Pueblo, Colorado, Mason City, Iowa. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=173.16s)]
*  Under Buttigieg, all the DOT has done so far was basically tell SkyWest, hey, you can't [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=176.92s)]
*  ditch these routes until the DOT finds another carrier to pick up these flights. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=181.44s)]
*  However, SkyWest only wants out because of the same pilot shortages that the other carriers [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=186.2s)]
*  are having. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Airlines right now are desperate for pilots. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=192.6s)]
*  They're kind of going into a hiring and training spree for pilots and for some others. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=194.68s)]
*  They're paying more. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  They're lowering some education requirements. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  The regional carrier Breeze Airways, they're using the E3 visa program to hire pilots from [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=202.16s)]
*  Australia. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  And obviously this is expensive and it's happening at a time where we're seeing a price surge [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=208.28s)]
*  for gas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=212.52s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=213.52s)]
*  So if VAX mandates did this to airlines, let's say you applied them to the Navy SEALs on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=215.22s)]
*  the eve of a war, I wonder what would happen to your military. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=219.08s)]
*  Jason Rantz, appreciate it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=222.96s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=224.84s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=225.84s)]
*  So ratings for the Oscars just decline every year because watching insipid self-involved [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=227.48s)]
*  people talk about themselves is not that interesting. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=232.32s)]
*  So this year they had a brand new idea. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's do something so degraded and violent on stage that everyone will talk about us. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=236.12s)]
*  We're going to talk about them too. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=240.56s)]
*  Here's Morgan joins us to dissect it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=242.0s)]
*  He's also here to tell us about his brand new show, which we're excited about. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=243.96s)]
*  That's next. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GeMgnufnM&t=247.12s)]
