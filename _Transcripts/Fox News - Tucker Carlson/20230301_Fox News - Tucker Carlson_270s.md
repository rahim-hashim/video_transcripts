# Kyle Rittenhouse: This is an attack on our 2nd Amendment rights
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw)
*  At the height of the BLM riots back in August of 2020, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=0.0s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse went to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where his father lived. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=2.72s)]
*  And that night, because he was asked to, he helped protect local businesses from the mob [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=5.68s)]
*  of people looting, destroying, and burning. As he was doing that, a mentally ill child [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=10.08s)]
*  molester called Joseph Rosenbaum tried to kill Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse defended himself and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=14.24s)]
*  shot Rosenbaum. And then several men began chasing Rittenhouse down the street. One of them was called [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=19.28s)]
*  Gage Groyskruz. Rittenhouse went to the ground. Groyskruz pointed a gun at him. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  In response, Rittenhouse shot him in the arm. That was obviously self-defense. It was on camera, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=29.52s)]
*  and Groyskruz admitted that at trial. Watch. Does this look like right now your arm is being shot? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=36.08s)]
*  That looks like my bicep being vaporized, yes. Okay. And it's being vaporized as you're pointing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  your gun directly at him. Yes? Yes. Okay. So when you were standing three to five feet from him [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=49.36s)]
*  with your arms up in the air, he never fired, right? Correct. It wasn't until you pointed your [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=59.36s)]
*  gun at him, advanced on him with your gun, now your hands down, pointed at him that he fired, right? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=66.64s)]
*  Correct. So, yes, I pointed a loaded gun in his face because I wanted to kill him, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=73.92s)]
*  and he shot me in the arm, disabling me and preventing me from killing him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=82.08s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's the appropriate use of force in the cause of self-defense. But because self-defense [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=86.8s)]
*  is no longer allowed in the United States, the man who tried to kill Kyle Rittenhouse is now suing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=93.68s)]
*  Kyle Rittenhouse for preventing him from killing Kyle Rittenhouse. Kyle Rittenhouse joins us now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=98.56s)]
*  Kyle, thanks so much for coming on. It's almost unbelievable that a man who tried to kill you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=104.24s)]
*  and was prevented from killing you by your act of self-defense is now suing you because he wasn't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=109.2s)]
*  able to kill you. How does that work? Thank you for having me, Tucker. And honestly, I have no idea. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous. This lawsuit is very frustrating and it's upsetting. This is honestly to me an [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=122.72s)]
*  attack on our Second Amendment rights and our rights to self-defense. And it's saying if you [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=128.08s)]
*  use your God-given rights to self-defense, they're going to come after you. If you win in court, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=133.68s)]
*  you're acquitted, rightfully so. They're going to take you to civil court and they're going to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=138.0s)]
*  take you for everything you're worth. They're going to drive you into bankruptcy and drown [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  you in a mountain of legal bills. That's what's actually happening. We're watching this happen [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  all over the country. Civil suits used to shut down free speech, to end the Second Amendment, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  to void the Bill of Rights, and to destroy people who stand up against the mob like you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=156.72s)]
*  Who's funding this suit? Do you have any idea? I have no idea who's funding this lawsuit. All [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  I know is that there's a powerhouse of attorneys behind Gage Grosz Scrooge and I have Mark Richards [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=167.28s)]
*  and I know we're going to win the court, but it's going to be expensive. It's going to cost a lot [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=174.24s)]
*  of money to fight. These attorneys are very powerful. You can go to www.givesandgo.com [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=178.56s)]
*  forward slash Kyle Renterhouse to help me take on these lawyers so they don't come after more [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  people because if they can come after me, they will come after you. Well, of course, and they [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=189.68s)]
*  are coming after people all over the country. It's an under covered story, the use of the civil courts [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=195.28s)]
*  to void the Bill of Rights and destroy anyone who stands in the way of their total takeover of the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  country. How old are you by the way at this point? I'm 20 years old. I was 17 when Gage Grosz Scrooge [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=206.56s)]
*  pointed the pistol at my head. Yeah, a loaded pistol and tried to kill you and you did absolutely [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=213.68s)]
*  the right thing and you disabled him before he could murder you. I assume at 20 you probably [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=219.28s)]
*  just kind of want to go live the rest of your one hopes long life, right? Absolutely, but they're [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=223.84s)]
*  trying to, they don't want me to, they want me to go away, but they want to drown me in these legal [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=230.8s)]
*  bills and they want to sue me and pretty much not allow me to live a normal 20-year-old life. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=237.36s)]
*  Yeah, well you did the right thing, you know. If someone points a loaded gun in your face and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=244.24s)]
*  tries to kill you, you have not just a right but an obligation to respond and you did. So Kyle [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=248.72s)]
*  Rittenhouse, thank you so much for joining us tonight and Godspeed in this and what's happening to you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUD-oJ71Puw&t=253.68s)]
