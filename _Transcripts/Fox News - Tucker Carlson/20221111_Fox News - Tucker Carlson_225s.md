# Adam Laxalt speaks out on pivotal Nevada senate race
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc)
*  Adam Laxtalt is living through this right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=0.0s)]
*  He's running for Senate from the state of Nevada, as we told you earlier. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  He joins us from there now. Adam Laxtalt, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=4.94s)]
*  What is the state of your race tonight? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=8.0s)]
*  Well, we feel really, really strongly about where this race is heading. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=11.64s)]
*  We've been in the lead, obviously, since election night. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=16.34s)]
*  That lead has shrunk over the last few days, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=19.78s)]
*  but she does not have the amount of votes left to be able to catch us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=23.96s)]
*  She'd have to win by over 63 percent. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=28.96s)]
*  And it's important to note, since most of the national media is not covering this, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=32.42s)]
*  the Las Vegas mail ballots that are being reported include [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=36.36s)]
*  Election Day drop off mail. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=41.3s)]
*  That mail is absolutely not going to break like, you know, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=43.9s)]
*  traditional mail through the USPS. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Those are Election Day voters. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=50.92s)]
*  And just to give you an example, in Washoe County, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=52.92s)]
*  we had more Republicans drop off Election Day ballots than Democrats. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=55.76s)]
*  And so, again, as we put out the math for the world, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=61.54s)]
*  she has to win by over 63 percent of all of this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  And we think that these Election Day ballots could break even. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  We could stand to lose them by 15, 20 points and we would still hold. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=73.52s)]
*  And so we feel like we're in a great, great position. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=77.86s)]
*  And just super proud of my team and a lot of hard work. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=80.86s)]
*  Incredibly tough race. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=85.02s)]
*  But we're going to win this thing, hopefully, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  and be important race for the country and my great state. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, we certainly agree with all of that, but we should know by now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=92.52s)]
*  It's been two days in Clark County, Nevada, where most of our viewers have been, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  since it's one of the country's biggest tourist destinations, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=101.3s)]
*  is one of the most technologically advanced places in the world. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=103.56s)]
*  You built a replica of the Eiffel Tower in your county. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  Everything is automated in Clark County, Nevada. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  So I'm honestly confused as to why they can't give us the results of an election [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  within a few hours. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=115.46s)]
*  You know, I absolutely believe we need to get rid of ballot harvesting [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=117.64s)]
*  and drop boxes and universal mail out balloting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  There's no reason. First, we don't even have we don't even have voter ID. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=126.28s)]
*  We need voter ID. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=130.24s)]
*  We need Election Day counting, as everyone keeps pointing out. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=131.64s)]
*  If Florida can do a 21 million people with three million people in Nevada, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=136.28s)]
*  we should know the results of the election. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=140.58s)]
*  And, you know, here's what people's missing is the human toll. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=143.12s)]
*  Never mind like the democracy piece, which is obviously the most important. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=146.08s)]
*  You have campaigns and staffs that are now just continuing for 20 hours. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=150.22s)]
*  When is the campaign over? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=155.5s)]
*  When do you get to tell your supporters, thank you for everything you did? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=157.96s)]
*  We've won. You know, when do you get your family to actually breathe that it's over? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=161.84s)]
*  This system is very, very flawed. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, everyone knows it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  I think Republicans and Democrats think this is just an astonishing process. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  And I don't think in Clark County, we did so much to make sure this was a secure [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=177.44s)]
*  election. We have lawyers everywhere. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=182.62s)]
*  We had election observers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  We feel confident that the votes the register announced today, there are just [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=187.16s)]
*  over 50,000 more mail mail votes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, total 70,000 tops. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  So we know the universe and we feel comfortable with the universe. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=198.66s)]
*  But nonetheless, we need to change the system. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=202.66s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's like a Roman siege. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=206.22s)]
*  They're trying to wait you out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=208.7s)]
*  We'll be following you. Adam Laxall, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=210.54s)]
*  Good luck. Thanks so much. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80KNnvkpfc&t=212.44s)]
