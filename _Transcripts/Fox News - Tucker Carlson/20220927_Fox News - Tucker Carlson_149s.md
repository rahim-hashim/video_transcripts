# 'I am afraid of the world our children will live in:' Kari Lake
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA)
*  All of us got us thinking about politicians in this country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=0.0s)]
*  who dare to tell the truth and are attacked for it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=2.74s)]
*  And Carrie Lake was at the very top of that list. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  She's running for governor in the state of Arizona [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=6.78s)]
*  and she joins us tonight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=8.46s)]
*  Carrie Lake, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=9.58s)]
*  So you were one of the very first American politicians [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  to weigh in on this election. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  You were paying attention, which I appreciated. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=16.16s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=18.52s)]
*  I'm so excited. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=20.92s)]
*  You know, it's funny, I looked this Italian, Ms. Maloney up [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=22.0s)]
*  when I heard about her about a week ago [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=26.02s)]
*  and I couldn't find any just straight up information [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  on her. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=31.64s)]
*  Everything was, she's a fascist, she's a racist, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=32.48s)]
*  she's this, she's that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=35.46s)]
*  And I thought, wow, this is somebody who I can relate to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=36.48s)]
*  because they're doing the same thing about me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=39.48s)]
*  And it makes me realize that if they're not calling you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=41.14s)]
*  all of these slurs, if they're not attacking you, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=44.22s)]
*  then you're probably not truly representing the people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=47.04s)]
*  of your country. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  But it's just so interesting that this is a change. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=51.7s)]
*  If you're elected in Arizona, it will be a change. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=54.739999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump was a change. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=56.88s)]
*  The people who are rejected by voters [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  in this representative democracy that we have, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=62.2s)]
*  never for one second learn anything from that rejection. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=64.92s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=68.08s)]
*  I don't know, I can't get into their minds, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=70.88s)]
*  but I mean, I think of the Marjorie Taylor greens [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=72.56s)]
*  of the world, the Congress and Paul Gosar [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=74.44s)]
*  as the Donald Trumps of the world, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  what's happening in Italy, myself, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=78.08s)]
*  the people who are truly understanding [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=80.36s)]
*  what's happening in this country, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=82.92s)]
*  which is we're losing this country, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=84.16s)]
*  are the ones who are being attacked. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=86.4s)]
*  And I'm on the campaign trail, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=88.04s)]
*  we're working six to 10 events a day, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  we're working really hard. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  And I had somebody reach out to me the other day [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  and say, Carrie, you are fearless, you are so fearless, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=95.04s)]
*  you're not afraid of anything. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=98.30000000000001s)]
*  And I stopped him and I said, actually, I have great fear. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=99.76s)]
*  I'm not afraid of the fake news, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=103.12s)]
*  I'm not afraid of the globalists, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm not afraid of anything that I'm facing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  on the campaign trail, I'm not afraid of the cartels. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=108.06s)]
*  What I am scared to death of is what happens [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=110.84s)]
*  if we don't step in right at this moment [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  and do something, I'm afraid of the world [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=115.78s)]
*  that our children will live in. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=118.58s)]
*  That's what scares me to death. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=120.0s)]
*  So you spent your career working in news [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=122.22s)]
*  so you know how totally fraudulent it is. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=124.42s)]
*  It's a burden some of us bear who work in this business. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=127.1s)]
*  Maybe that's why you're not afraid. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=129.96s)]
*  Thank God for you, thank God for you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=131.26s)]
*  Because you know it's fake. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=132.78s)]
*  Truly. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=133.86s)]
*  Carrie Lake, Godspeed, thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWmqyuk8OA&t=134.7s)]
