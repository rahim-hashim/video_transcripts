# Tucker: Trump was right about this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, happy Monday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=2.72s)]
*  If you watched Donald Trump closely over his four years in office, and we did, it became [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=4.22s)]
*  pretty clear that the more outlandish the claim that Trump happened to be making, the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=8.94s)]
*  more likely it was to be true. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=13.88s)]
*  Trump did tend to exaggerate at times, but it was mostly about topics that didn't matter. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=16.98s)]
*  How big was the crowd at his 2016 inauguration? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=21.2s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=24.78s)]
*  But on the big things, on matters of civilizational importance, Trump told the truth bluntly, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=26.26s)]
*  often when nobody else would. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=31.18s)]
*  The Iraq war was a mistake, Trump said. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=33.1s)]
*  Illegal immigration is a disaster. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  China is taking over the world. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=36.94s)]
*  Haiti is a pretty crappy place. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=39.1s)]
*  Deafening hysteria followed every one of these demonstrably true statements. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=41.82s)]
*  At one point in early 2018, CNN and the Washington Post got so worked up trying to hide the obvious [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=46.34s)]
*  that they devoted blanket coverage to the claim that actually Haiti is an awesome and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=52.24s)]
*  fully functional country, a perfect spot for your next family vacation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=57.2s)]
*  And by the way, if you disagree with that, you're racist. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=61.24s)]
*  That's what they told us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  Three years later, they have dropped the pose, at least on Haiti. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=65.4s)]
*  Our leaders now consider Haiti so awful that just being from there qualifies you for asylum [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=68.64s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=74.4s)]
*  With Trump gone, they can finally admit that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=75.92s)]
*  What was once a dangerous conspiracy theory is now just a sensible observation, especially [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=78.0s)]
*  when it justifies more immigration. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=82.22s)]
*  For four years, no dangerous conspiracy theory was considered more dangerous or more conspiratorial [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=84.82s)]
*  than the claim that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign had spied on Donald Trump. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=90.48s)]
*  The very idea that Hillary Clinton, of all people, had spied on anyone was preposterous, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=95.02s)]
*  the media informed us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=100.22s)]
*  Only a lunatic would claim otherwise. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=101.7s)]
*  By making a charge like that, in fact, Trump was emboldening our enemies and degrading [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=104.1s)]
*  the public's confidence in our democratic system. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=108.56s)]
*  So it wasn't just a stupid opinion that Trump had. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=111.26s)]
*  It was really a form of treason. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=113.7s)]
*  And yet, as usual, Trump kept saying it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=116.18s)]
*  Watch him do it again in one of his last sit-down interviews as president with Leslie Stoll of 60 Minutes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=118.9s)]
*  The biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  They spied on my campaign, Leslie. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=128.4s)]
*  Yeah, there's no real evidence of that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=129.4s)]
*  Of course there is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=131.3s)]
*  No. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=132.3s)]
*  It's all over the place. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=133.3s)]
*  Leslie, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=134.3s)]
*  Can I say something? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=136.3s)]
*  You know, this is 60 Minutes and we can't put on things we can't verify. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=138.06s)]
*  Then you won't put it on because it's bad for Biden. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=142.9s)]
*  We can't put on things we can't verify. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=144.78s)]
*  Leslie, they spied on my campaign. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, we can't verify that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=148.74s)]
*  It's been totally verified. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=149.74s)]
*  No. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=150.74s)]
*  It's been, just go down and get the papers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=151.74s)]
*  They spied on my campaign, they got caught. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=154.38s)]
*  No. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=156.54000000000002s)]
*  And then they went much further than that and they got caught. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  And you will see that, Leslie. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  And you know that, but you just don't want to put it on the air. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=161.86s)]
*  No. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=164.02s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I don't know that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=165.02s)]
*  No, as a matter of fact, we can't verify that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=166.98s)]
*  This is CBS News. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=168.9s)]
*  We don't air things we can't verify. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=169.9s)]
*  Really, Leslie Stahl, is that true? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=171.78s)]
*  We still remember a CBS News piece from 2016 that claimed that Donald Trump was secretly [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=175.18s)]
*  working with Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=179.7s)]
*  So the question is, how did CBS News verify those facts? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=181.54s)]
*  Walk us through your reporting process. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=184.1s)]
*  Well, as it turns out, that particular story, the reporting came from reading a piece on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=185.74s)]
*  Slate.com, probably while standing in line at Starbucks. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=190.98s)]
*  Slate alleged that the Trump campaign was coordinating with a Russian bank called Alpha [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=194.3s)]
*  Bank using a hidden server in Trump Tower. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  How did Slate.com know this? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=201.74s)]
*  By consulting a, quote, small, tightly knit community of computer scientists. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=203.9s)]
*  These scientists, Slate insisted, were totally nonpartisan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=208.82000000000002s)]
*  One of the sources explained anonymously, quote, we wanted to defend both campaigns [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=212.58s)]
*  because we wanted to preserve the integrity of the election. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=217.10000000000002s)]
*  So here you have just another unnamed computer scientist defending election integrity. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=221.42s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=226.22s)]
*  Don't ask questions. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=227.22s)]
*  Jake Sullivan did not ask questions. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=228.22s)]
*  Jake Sullivan takes Slate.com very seriously. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=229.54s)]
*  At the time, Jake Sullivan was working for the Hillary Clinton campaign. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=232.66s)]
*  He cited the Slate story as evidence that Trump was indeed colluding with Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=236.27999999999997s)]
*  Quote, the secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump's ties to Russia. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=240.94s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=246.94s)]
*  Sullivan said, what a tool. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=247.94s)]
*  We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=250.1s)]
*  Trump and Russia. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=254.22s)]
*  So there was a bat phone in Trump Tower that rang directly in the Kremlin. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=256.54s)]
*  Jake Sullivan stuck to that line for months. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=261.7s)]
*  Here he is on CNN in March of 2017. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=263.74s)]
*  What we learned during the campaign was that very serious computer science experts, people [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=267.62s)]
*  who work closely with the United States government, had uncovered this secret hotline between [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=272.38s)]
*  the Alpha Bank, the Russian bank, and the Trump Organization. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=279.62s)]
*  Now, of course, we didn't know for sure if in fact that were the case, but we knew that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  it should be investigated. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=287.46s)]
*  And we knew that given how serious these computer scientists were, they weren't just making [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=288.82s)]
*  up crackpot theories. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  So it wasn't surprising to learn that even as of last week, the FBI is still looking [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  into this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  And do you have any idea what they're looking for? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=300.86s)]
*  Of course, I don't have a line into the FBI on this, but what I know based on public reporting [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=301.86s)]
*  is that there is very unusual server activity between this Russian bank and the Trump Organization, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=306.58s)]
*  which suggests contact that took place over the course of the campaign. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  Oh, the secret hotline. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=316.42s)]
*  These people are literally willing to say anything if it gives them power. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=319.9s)]
*  But listen carefully to what Jake Sullivan said. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=324.78s)]
*  I don't have a line into the FBI on this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=326.62s)]
*  Everything I know is from public reporting. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=329.18s)]
*  So you'll notice that Sullivan went out of his way to say that, which should have been [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=330.7s)]
*  a very clear sign that it was a lie. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=335.34s)]
*  And indeed, it was a lie. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=337.53999999999996s)]
*  In fact, the Hillary Clinton for President campaign was coordinating directly with the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=339.06s)]
*  FBI. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=342.29999999999995s)]
*  A Clinton lawyer called Michael Sussman had been feeding false claims about Trump and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=343.29999999999995s)]
*  Russia once again from that crack team of nonpartisan computer scientists to the general [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=347.26s)]
*  counsel at the FBI, a man called James Baker. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  But Sussman didn't stop there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  In February of 2017, after the election, Sussman also met with the general counsel at CIA. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=356.62s)]
*  So at this point, you may be wondering about the identity of those nonpartisan computer [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=363.94s)]
*  scientists who dug up all this new information about Donald Trump's direct connection to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=367.76s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=371.98s)]
*  Who are these people? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=372.98s)]
*  Well, you may not be shocked to learn they weren't nonpartisan. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=373.98s)]
*  Once again, Jake Sullivan was lying to us. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=377.92s)]
*  In fact, a pro-Hillary Clinton activist from South Africa called Rodney Joffe had put together [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=381.18s)]
*  a team of digital researchers. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=386.38s)]
*  Oppo guys, we used to call them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=388.42s)]
*  Most of them came from Georgia Tech. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=390.42s)]
*  In emails, Rodney Joffe explained why he was doing this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=392.9s)]
*  He wanted Hillary to win the presidency because Hillary Clinton had promised him a job as [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=395.18s)]
*  a top cybersecurity officer in the U.S. government. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=399.82s)]
*  So Joffe wanted to help Hillary win. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  He said that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=405.58s)]
*  In order to do that, he gave his nonpartisan computer scientists a mission. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=406.58s)]
*  Their job was to gather data they had access to thanks to a Pentagon contract in order [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=410.4s)]
*  to connect Donald Trump to Putin. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=415.44s)]
*  Now we know all this thanks to a new court filing from special counsel John Durham, who [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=418.58s)]
*  spent the last few years investigating the origins of the Russia hoax and is finally [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=422.18s)]
*  producing some material. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  In the words of Durham's filing, quote, Joffe tasked those researchers to mine internet [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=428.14s)]
*  data to establish an inference and a narrative tying then candidate Trump to Russia. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=433.3s)]
*  So this wasn't reporting, of course. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=439.64s)]
*  They had a goal. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=442.54s)]
*  They were trying to get Hillary elected president. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=443.94s)]
*  The amazing thing is how they did it, where their data came from. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=447.14s)]
*  The filing says that Joffe and his computer scientists intercepted internet traffic, that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=450.86s)]
*  is emails and presumably text messages, from quote, Trump Tower, Donald Trump's Central [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=455.18s)]
*  Park West apartment building, and the executive office of the president of the United States. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=460.7s)]
*  In other words, Trump was right. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=467.88s)]
*  This isn't a conspiracy theory. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=470.5s)]
*  His claims were true. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=472.06s)]
*  Democrats were spying on Donald Trump, not just as a candidate, but as president of the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=473.94s)]
*  in the White House as well as in his own home. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=478.18s)]
*  So has anything like this ever happened in American history? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=482.5s)]
*  Not that we know of. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=485.06s)]
*  But Jeff Bezos doesn't think you should worry about it or even know that it happened. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=486.44s)]
*  Today's Washington Post informed its brain dead readership that while quote, Trump is [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=490.26s)]
*  once again claiming that he was spied upon, that claim has been quote, debunked. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=494.21999999999997s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=499.74s)]
*  How has it been debunked? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=501.53999999999996s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=502.7s)]
*  It just has. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=503.7s)]
*  But in fact, that claim has not been debunked. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=505.38s)]
*  It has been verified. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=507.7s)]
*  That claim is true. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=509.14s)]
*  It actually happened. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=510.32s)]
*  And the way it happened tells you everything about why it has been so extraordinarily difficult [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=511.82s)]
*  to bring democracy back to the United States. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=516.5s)]
*  A government contractor spied on a populist presidential candidate, then passed the information [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=519.58s)]
*  to his opponent's campaign, which gave it to the FBI and the news media, which distorted [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=524.58s)]
*  it to create the illusion of treason, which was then cited by the politician who paid [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=528.9399999999999s)]
*  for the whole thing as a reason not to vote for the guy she spied on. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=532.7s)]
*  Got it? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=536.7800000000001s)]
*  It's a closed loop. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=537.7800000000001s)]
*  Everyone's got a role. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=538.7800000000001s)]
*  Here's Hillary Clinton during the presidential debates. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=540.7800000000001s)]
*  Putin, from everything I see, has no respect for this person. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=543.1400000000001s)]
*  Well that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=549.7800000000001s)]
*  It's pretty clear you won't admit that the Russians have engaged in cyber attacks against [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=554.5s)]
*  the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=560.78s)]
*  willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=568.3399999999999s)]
*  he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=574.9s)]
*  favorite in this race. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=583.24s)]
*  So if you're not all in with NATO, if you think it's a pointless boondoggle that endangers [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=585.24s)]
*  you, my friend, work for Vladimir Putin. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=590.62s)]
*  You encouraged espionage, Shrig Tillery. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=593.62s)]
*  At the very moment she was doing precisely that. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=596.34s)]
*  They always denounce you for their own sins. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=598.58s)]
*  But she said Russia has engaged in cyber attacks on the United States, and that's probably [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  true in point of fact. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=605.78s)]
*  But she was speaking about a specific, quote, cyber attack. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=608.1s)]
*  She was talking about the Russians hacking the servers at the DNC. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=611.92s)]
*  That's wasted three years of our lives telling us that at ever-increasing volume. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=617.06s)]
*  Here's the interesting thing. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=621.38s)]
*  It was not true. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=622.7399999999999s)]
*  It has never been true. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=623.7399999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Putin did not hack the DNC. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  There was never any evidence that the Russians hacked the DNC. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=627.7399999999999s)]
*  Instead, the DNC emails were very clearly stolen from within the building, most likely [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=630.78s)]
*  by a Bernie Sanders supporter who wanted to show the world how Bernie Sanders was being [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=635.7399999999999s)]
*  shafted by the very same corrupt forces in Washington that later shafted Donald Trump. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=639.42s)]
*  That was very obvious to anyone who was paying attention at the time. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=645.36s)]
*  What's interesting is that no one's been punished for it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=649.24s)]
*  Likely no one ever will be. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=652.32s)]
*  In fact, Jake Sullivan, the guy you just saw lying about those nonpartisan computer scientists, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=653.32s)]
*  has not been indicted for what he did. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=658.28s)]
*  Jake Sullivan has been promoted. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=659.76s)]
*  Jake Sullivan is now Joe Biden's national security advisor. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=661.52s)]
*  He's still screaming about Russia, only this time it's not to bring down a Republican [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=665.04s)]
*  opponent in a presidential race. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=668.86s)]
*  He's screaming about Russia to bring the entire country to war with the nuclear-armed power. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb-fQTm_fP0&t=670.8000000000001s)]
