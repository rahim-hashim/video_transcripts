# Inside Tucker Carlson's trip to the Fox Nation Patriot Awards
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs)
*  Fox News had the Patriot Awards in Florida last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=0.0s)]
*  We went for the second time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=4.04s)]
*  One of the things that you notice when you're there [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=5.12s)]
*  is that there's not a huge difference [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=7.4s)]
*  between the people who work at Fox and run Fox [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=9.34s)]
*  and the people who watch Fox. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=11.84s)]
*  And if you've been around TV for a while, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=14.16s)]
*  that's a rare thing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=15.56s)]
*  Made that point, actually. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=17.52s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=18.48s)]
*  The cool thing about meeting Fox viewers [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=19.88s)]
*  is every time I think this, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=21.88s)]
*  oh, I can relate to that person. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=23.84s)]
*  That person has the same instincts I do. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Not just the same ideas, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=29.08s)]
*  but the same gut reaction to things. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=30.0s)]
*  I like those people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=32.54s)]
*  I mean it, too. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=34.48s)]
*  And I will say this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=36.199999999999996s)]
*  One of my rules is don't suck up to your employer [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=39.04s)]
*  because that's kind of cravin', right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=42.2s)]
*  You should always be a little bit against the man. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=44.76s)]
*  Well, I want to thank my employer who signs my paycheck. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=47.76s)]
*  But this is real. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  And I was reminded of it tonight [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=53.22s)]
*  because I was with people who work at Fox [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=54.16s)]
*  and people who watch Fox. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  And there's not a big difference, actually. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=58.28s)]
*  There really isn't. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=60.88s)]
*  They're nice. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=63.64s)]
*  They're the kind of people who actually tip the waiter. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=65.2s)]
*  Pretty generously. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=67.72s)]
*  And those are the kind of people I love. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=69.68s)]
*  Those are the kind of people I'm blessed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=71.72s)]
*  to work around and live with. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=72.72s)]
*  And those are the kind of people [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=74.28s)]
*  I'm blessed to have watch our channel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=75.64s)]
*  So there really is a difference. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=80.04s)]
*  Everyone claims to love other people, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  but some people love them in the abstract. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=83.48s)]
*  I'm sending money to a cause I don't understand [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  in a place I've never been. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=87.88s)]
*  None of the people who love the people around them [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=89.32s)]
*  in their immediate orbit. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  And we have a lot of the second category here at Fox News [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=94.88s)]
*  and a lot of those people watch us too [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=97.84s)]
*  and we are grateful for that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, we took a bunch of behind the scenes footage. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=101.28s)]
*  Here's some of it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=103.36s)]
*  All right, so I should keep the obscenity to minimum. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=104.44s)]
*  When you have a microphone on, officer. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=106.86s)]
*  Oh, you're the one I want to talk to. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=108.84s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=112.64s)]
*  Who is the best guest that I can have on? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  And I said, Tucker, will you come on my podcast? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=116.04s)]
*  And he's like, are you kidding? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=118.76s)]
*  Of course I'm coming on your podcast. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=120.04s)]
*  The great Janice Dean, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=122.04s)]
*  the bravest person at Fox is true. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  Oh stop. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=125.56s)]
*  You went after the governor of New York. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  That man, Charles Cougar, my producer, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=130.68s)]
*  just got two deer in the state of Michigan. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=133.36s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=135.68s)]
*  Thank you Janice, that was wonderful. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=138.56s)]
*  So we're in the basement delivery area [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  of a large concrete building. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=144.52s)]
*  And when you go to see Greg Gutfeld, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=146.24s)]
*  the story of his magnitude, this is where you find yourself. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  We're entering the Gutfeld zone. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=150.08s)]
*  Am I going? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=155.24s)]
*  I gotta be honest, Greg, and I mean this from the bottom [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=157.36s)]
*  of my heart, I don't think I've ever eaten asparagus. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=159.56s)]
*  It's the ugliest vegetable. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  I would never eat that, I would never eat that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=163.4s)]
*  Can I bother you three? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  We're shooting a package for the channel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  We just want to ask one question, it's super, super easy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  Which is, what's your favorite show on Fox? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=171.4s)]
*  Okay, I got that, that's easy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=174.28s)]
*  We all say it at the same time, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=175.12s)]
*  because they're different. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=175.96s)]
*  All right, three, two, one. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=177.04s)]
*  Tucker Carlson. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=179.44s)]
*  We don't always tell everybody how we feel about Tucker, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=180.64s)]
*  but he's always our secret favorite. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=183.76s)]
*  No, I was gonna ask you if Tucker Carlson was here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=185.76s)]
*  Paris Flock was a close second. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=188.04s)]
*  Oh, by far. Tucker Carlson. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=189.6s)]
*  Tucker. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=191.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=191.84s)]
*  Woo. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=192.84s)]
*  Worth watching, we'll be back at 8 p.m. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=196.28s)]
*  And we're back, have a great evening. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=198.72s)]
*  What did you love? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=201.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=202.44s)]
*  What's up, guys? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=203.28s)]
*  Can I get a picture with this one? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=204.12s)]
*  Tucker, please, thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=205.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=207.2s)]
*  Come on, thanks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=209.36s)]
*  The sworn enemy of line, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=210.64s)]
*  capacity, smugness, and growth. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=212.6s)]
*  You know him, Tucker Carlson. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=215.24s)]
*  So they, our producers found people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=222.12s)]
*  who said they liked the show. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=223.72s)]
*  It's a little embarrassing, hadn't seen that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=225.24s)]
*  There were some great people there, though. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=227.64s)]
*  And again, the spread between the people [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=229.16s)]
*  who work at Fox and run Fox [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=231.56s)]
*  and the people who watch Fox is basically zero. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=233.24s)]
*  And that's why people watch Fox, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=236.52s)]
*  because we're not kidding. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=238.36s)]
*  You can watch the whole thing, by the way, right now, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=240.32s)]
*  if you're interested on Fox Nation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6MuT0ygyUs&t=241.72s)]
