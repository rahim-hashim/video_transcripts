# Tucker Carlson: This is shocking
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight there are an awful lot of forgotten little towns in this country and Braddock, Pennsylvania is definitely one of them. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=2.0s)]
*  It's only 11 miles outside Pittsburgh, but Braddock is basically empty at this point. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=6.5s)]
*  Only 1,700 people live there. That's down from a population of more than 18,000 during the Second World War. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=11.0s)]
*  Braddock is now so underpopulated that you can buy a four-bedroom home there with a two-car garage right in the middle of town for $3,000. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=18.5s)]
*  Don't believe it? Check it out yourself on Realtor.com. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=28.0s)]
*  So you know the story. For decades the biggest employer in Braddock was manufacturing, something called the Edgar Thompson Steelworks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=31.0s)]
*  In fact, Andrew Carnegie built it there along with his first stone public library, which still stands. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=38.0s)]
*  So for generations, Braddock, Pennsylvania was a real place and then inevitably the steel plant closed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=43.0s)]
*  And the usual disasters arrived. Unemployment, hopelessness, drugs, people left by the thousands. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=48.0s)]
*  But one man saw an opportunity in Braddock, Pennsylvania. Not an opportunity for the town, but an opportunity for himself. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=54.5s)]
*  That man's name was John Fetterman. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=61.5s)]
*  Fetterman was 35 years old and had never in his life had a real job. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=63.5s)]
*  Fetterman was not from Braddock. Hardly. He grew up in an affluent neighborhood four hours away. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=67.5s)]
*  Fetterman had spent his adult life going to school, first to business school, then to Harvard for a so-called Masters of Public Policy, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=72.5s)]
*  which for the uninitiated is an utterly meaningless document that you pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to get in order to tell people that you went to Harvard. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=80.5s)]
*  But in Fetterman's case, it wasn't expensive at all. It was free. His dad paid for it and paid for everything else. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=88.5s)]
*  As the Philadelphia Inquirer put it, for a long stretch lasting well into his 40s, deep into middle age, Fetterman's main source of income came from his parents. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=94.5s)]
*  They gave him and his family $54,000 in 2015 alone. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=104.5s)]
*  In other words, John Fetterman was a classic trusteferian, a flaky middle aged man looking for a purpose in life. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=108.5s)]
*  And in Braddock, Pennsylvania, he found one. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=115.5s)]
*  In 2005, a year after arriving in Braddock, Fetterman announced he was running for mayor. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=118.5s)]
*  And amazingly boldly, given that he was a professional student living off his rich family, John Fetterman decided to run as a blue collar populist. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=123.5s)]
*  But the media asked no questions. They loved it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=133.5s)]
*  In John Fetterman, the media saw themselves. He was just like them. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=136.5s)]
*  So Fetterman narrowly won the race and then the campaign to boost John Fetterman's career began in earnest. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=139.5s)]
*  The Guardian newspaper described John Fetterman as the coolest mayor in the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=146.5s)]
*  The New York Times told its readers, who didn't know any better, that John Fetterman had, quote, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=150.5s)]
*  turned the busted town of Braddock, PA, into a national symbol of hope, hard work and authentic blue jeans. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=155.5s)]
*  Wow, how inspiring. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=162.5s)]
*  Fetterman thought it was. He went on a national tour to brag about how he was single handedly saving this benighted mill town in western Pennsylvania. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=165.5s)]
*  He gave a TED talk. Of course he did. But he was running Braddock using the lessons that he learned at Harvard. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=172.5s)]
*  In 2011, he went. Of course he did, to the Aspen Ideas Festival to further brag. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=179.5s)]
*  Here's what he said, quote, We created the first art gallery in the Furtown region with artist studios. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=185.5s)]
*  We did public art installations. And I don't know if you consider it art exactly, but I consider growing organic vegetables in the shadow of a steel mill an art. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=191.5s)]
*  And that has attracted homesteading. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=200.5s)]
*  It's so perfect. Homesteading, organic vegetables, art installations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=203.5s)]
*  And also, again, inevitably a heaping dose of climate theology, all imported from Harvard. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=208.5s)]
*  So Fetterman imposed on a town with no jobs carbon caps on Braddock, Pennsylvania. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=214.5s)]
*  And he claimed these carbon caps would somehow, he never explained how, bring more manufacturing jobs back. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=219.5s)]
*  He called this initiative Carbon Caps Equals Hard Hats. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=225.5s)]
*  So expensive, unreliable energy will mean more manufacturing jobs. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=229.5s)]
*  And yet somehow no one laughed at him. So John Fetterman kept going. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=235.5s)]
*  In a 2009 advertisement for himself, he promised that, quote, With a smart, economically viable carbon cap policy in place, communities like Braddock can begin to build its manufacturing and middle class backup. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=240.5s)]
*  This whole notion that we can continue to operate as we have been and ignore climate change is ludicrous. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=252.5s)]
*  They loved it at the Aspen Institute. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=260.5s)]
*  And to be fair, John Fetterman did not ignore climate change. He talked about climate change endlessly. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=262.5s)]
*  He made climate change the centerpiece of his administration in Braddock, Pennsylvania. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=267.5s)]
*  As for actually running the town or improving the town of Braddock, he was not interested, not even a little bit interested. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=271.5s)]
*  And that's provable. As mayor, according to public records obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, Fetterman missed more than a third of the borough's monthly meetings. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=276.5s)]
*  He was off at the Aspen Institute. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=286.5s)]
*  In his entire tenure as the mayor of Braddock, John Fetterman cast just a single vote at a city council meeting. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=288.5s)]
*  And that was a meaningless one. It was a procedural vote for borough president. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=294.5s)]
*  So what happened next? This is always our favorite part of the story. What were the results? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=298.5s)]
*  How did Braddock, Pennsylvania fair under the leadership of John Fetterman? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=302.5s)]
*  That's the only question that matters. And again, we want to be as fair and objective as we can be. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=306.5s)]
*  So we're going to tell you that under his tenure as mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, the seas did not rise. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=311.5s)]
*  That is true. Braddock is still on dry land. Of course, it's very far from the ocean, but it's still dry. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=316.5s)]
*  So his climate policy worked. He can be proud of that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=321.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, everything else fell apart in Braddock. People kept fleeing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=324.5s)]
*  Braddock's population is currently at its lowest level ever recorded. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=328.5s)]
*  The median income in Braddock, Pennsylvania is $14,000 a year. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=332.5s)]
*  More than a third of households in Braddock live below the poverty line. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=337.5s)]
*  Braddock, by the way, has one of the highest crime rates in the state of Pennsylvania. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=341.5s)]
*  In 2018, shortly after Fetterman left office, Braddock's per capita murder rate was higher than it is in some of the most dangerous countries in the world. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=345.5s)]
*  Honduras and Belize are safer than Braddock, Pennsylvania. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=354.5s)]
*  So that's a failure. And in a functioning system, a record like this would have disqualified John Fetterman from ever running for anything again. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=359.5s)]
*  He failed demonstrably as a leader. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=368.5s)]
*  It had a higher murder rate than Honduras and the lowest population ever recorded. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=371.5s)]
*  Sorry, climate change didn't improve the town. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=375.5s)]
*  So in a fair system, a system that cared about achievement, a meritocratic system, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=379.5s)]
*  John Fetterman would be leaving politics on the express train and moving on to something like interpretive dance. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=384.5s)]
*  Try that. Maybe get his dad to pay for ski lessons and move to Aspen or something. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=389.5s)]
*  But we don't have a functioning meritocracy, much less a functioning political system. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=394.5s)]
*  We have a very broken one. So John Fetterman set his sights even higher. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=398.5s)]
*  Having wrecked Braddock, he became lieutenant governor and now he plans to run for the United States Senate. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=402.5s)]
*  What's he going to do if he gets there? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=408.5s)]
*  Well, his idea is to make the entire state of Pennsylvania and the entire country much more like Braddock with much higher crime rates. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=409.5s)]
*  And we're not making that up. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=417.5s)]
*  Here he is, John Fetterman in 2020 as lieutenant governor, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=418.5s)]
*  fantasizing about giving amnesty to thousands of violent criminals, including murderers. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=422.5s)]
*  If you had a magic wand and you could wave it and fix one thing, what would it be? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=427.5s)]
*  Life without parole in Pennsylvania, we could save billions in revenue long term. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=434.5s)]
*  We could save thousands of lives and not make anyone less safe and also expunges [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=440.5s)]
*  many permanent records of people that have been living their best lives and have been paying well beyond when they should have for a charge that they caught 10, 15, 20 years ago. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=445.5s)]
*  So in huge parts of Pennsylvania, which is a big state, real state filled with really nice people, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=456.5s)]
*  and it was an economic powerhouse for more than 100 years in huge parts of that state, there are no jobs. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=462.5s)]
*  There is poverty, there is hopelessness, and there are huge numbers of drug ODs. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=468.5s)]
*  That's the state's been devastated by opioids, by fentanyl. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=473.5s)]
*  But John Fetterman, if he had one wish, if he could make one change to the state of Pennsylvania, he'd let the murderers out. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=477.5s)]
*  Right. That's what he cares about. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=485.5s)]
*  So in Pennsylvania, typically if you commit murder, you get life in prison, as you should. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=488.5s)]
*  You're not allowed to kill people. But Fetterman would change that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=492.5s)]
*  He'd like you out of jail as quickly as possible. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=495.5s)]
*  Talk about a rich kid concern, by the way. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=497.5s)]
*  No actual populist or actual working class person talks like this, worries about punishing murderers too much. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=500.5s)]
*  Maybe if you achieved the first 115 things on your to-do list, you'd worry about, are the murderers serving too much time in prison? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=507.5s)]
*  That'd be after you got people jobs, after you convinced their children to stay in the state where they were born, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=514.5s)]
*  after you fixed the fact that thousands are dying of drug ODs. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=520.5s)]
*  Only rich kids think like that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=524.5s)]
*  And by the way, only rich kids wear hoodies to political events. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=526.5s)]
*  I'm a working man, I'm wearing a hoodie. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=531.5s)]
*  No working man actually wears a hoodie to a political event. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=533.5s)]
*  All your stupid little fake tattoos. It's a costume, of course. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=536.5s)]
*  Duh. It's not real. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=540.5s)]
*  But John Fetterman, inspired by his time at Harvard and the Aspen Institute, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=543.5s)]
*  would like to free a third of the prison population in Pennsylvania. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=548.5s)]
*  And it's just for starters. Watch. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=552.5s)]
*  I was on a panel with Secretary Wetzel earlier before the pandemic hit, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=554.5s)]
*  and he said something remarkable that I agree with. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=559.5s)]
*  He said, we could reduce our prison population by a third and not make anyone less safe in Pennsylvania. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=562.5s)]
*  And that's a profound statement. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=570.5s)]
*  It's not a profound statement. It's absurd. It's ridiculous. It's a profound statement. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=572.5s)]
*  Where do you learn to talk like this? It's a profound statement, says the hoodie guy. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=578.5s)]
*  You're an idiot. You've never had a job. And you wrecked the town that you ran. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=581.5s)]
*  You didn't even show up at council meetings. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=585.5s)]
*  What? Climate change. Let the murderers out. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=587.5s)]
*  We'll have a much safer society when we let the incorrigibly violent roam among us. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=590.5s)]
*  Right. This is the guy who made Bratid, Pennsylvania more dangerous than Honduras. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=596.5s)]
*  And of course, the point is not simply to wreck what he inherited, what we all inherited. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=602.5s)]
*  It's to change the state forever for his own political benefit. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=607.5s)]
*  The point is to flood the state of Pennsylvania with brand new voters, all of them loyal to the Democratic Party. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=611.5s)]
*  More voter fraud, please. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=617.5s)]
*  Feteman has been in a lockstep with the leaders of his party on that question from the very beginning. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=619.5s)]
*  And that's why he would like to get rid of all barriers to voter fraud, including and especially voter ID, as soon as possible. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=623.5s)]
*  In my own state, they are going to pass, attempt to pass a constitutional amendment, making sure that universal voting ID for every time you vote, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=633.5s)]
*  not just when you sign up to vote, but every time you vote, because they understand that at any given time, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=642.5s)]
*  there's tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians who typically are on the poorer side and are people of color that are less likely to have their ID at any one given time. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=648.5s)]
*  So poor people don't have IDs? Really? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=659.5s)]
*  Because everyone who lives in our society over the age of 18 has a government issued ID because you can't live here otherwise. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=664.5s)]
*  And you can't collect any government benefits without one. You can't do anything without one. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=670.5s)]
*  So that's a lie. He's affirmatively abetting voter fraud. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=674.5s)]
*  Now, we should tell you that the clips we just played were John Feteman speaking before he had. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=680.5s)]
*  And we say this with no glee, but instead with deep sympathy, a massive stroke. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=686.5s)]
*  His campaign says the stroke occurred shortly before he won the Democratic state primary in May. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=691.5s)]
*  Whenever it happened or whatever caused it, the stroke has been profound and has rendered Feteman unable to speak coherently. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=697.5s)]
*  And again, we're not being mean. We say this with sympathy. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=704.5s)]
*  But it's true because it's not just about John Feteman and how he's feeling. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=707.5s)]
*  It's about the country he hopes to control if elected to the United States Senate. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=711.5s)]
*  And so it's bad. It's really bad. Here he was campaigning recently in Pittsburgh, for example. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=716.5s)]
*  Just earlier today, I was so proud to march with you in downtown Pittsburgh. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=722.5s)]
*  Labor Day. Happy Labor Day. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=728.5s)]
*  Send me to Washington, D.C. to send so I can work with Senator Casey. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=731.5s)]
*  And I can champion the union way of life in Jersey and excuse me in D.C. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=737.5s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=744.5s)]
*  And it's an honor. I live eight minutes away from here. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=747.5s)]
*  And when I leave tonight, I got three miles away. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=752.5s)]
*  Dr. Oz in his mansion in New Jersey. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=757.5s)]
*  You've got a friend and you have an ally. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=761.5s)]
*  Send me to Washington, D.C. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=764.5s)]
*  You know, it's not even worth making fun of. It's sad. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=769.5s)]
*  But when cognition goes, when the ability to think clearly disappears, and in his case, it obviously has what's left, the talking points, that's all that remains. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=772.5s)]
*  And that's all he has. The talking with the union way of life. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=783.5s)]
*  This is a kid who lived off his parents until he was in his mid 40s. What? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=786.5s)]
*  He's never been in a union. What are you even talking about, you fraud? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=789.5s)]
*  So not surprisingly, Federman has refused up until today to schedule a debate with his opponent, Dr. Oz. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=794.5s)]
*  Just hours ago, he announced he's willing to debate. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=801.5s)]
*  But no details are forthcoming. Sometime in mid-October, of course, when the early voting has already been well in progress. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=803.5s)]
*  It's starting now, by the way, the early voting in Pennsylvania. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=812.5s)]
*  So if you delay the debate to right before the election, it's irrelevant because people have already voted. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=815.5s)]
*  Only Democrats seem to understand this. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=823.5s)]
*  He doesn't even talk to the media at this point because he can't. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=827.5s)]
*  In some cases, here's one, his staffers won't even let him answer questions that he has posed. Watch this. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=831.5s)]
*  Hey, John, are you afraid to debate Dr. Oz? Are you afraid to debate Dr. Oz? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=838.5s)]
*  Thank you, John. Are you going to debate him? He's offered five debates. Are you going to debate him? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=844.5s)]
*  His hoodie and his fraudulent tattoos. I mean, honestly, this is like the barista in Brooklyn dressing like a lumberjack. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=851.5s)]
*  Oh, please go back to Oberlin, you fake. So there's a huge problem here. The guy can't talk. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=858.5s)]
*  OK, and even Senators acknowledged that. John Federman, a candidate for the US Senate, cannot speak. Watch. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=864.5s)]
*  Members of the United Steelworkers Tuesday, Federman was on message, but often halting in his speech and occasionally dropped words mid-sentence. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=872.5s)]
*  Being anti-Union is anti-American. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=881.5s)]
*  What is wrong with demanding for an easy, safe kind of their income, a path to a safe place for them to win or excuse me, to work? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=887.5s)]
*  Federman declined to answer questions from CNN and other reporters at the event. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=907.5s)]
*  So we can go on and on and play you more tape, but it's just awful. And nobody wants to watch that. We don't want to play it for you. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=913.5s)]
*  We just want to make the point. This guy is completely impaired. That's not some kind of Republican talking point. It's completely real. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=918.5s)]
*  So think about what that means. The Democratic Party has not replaced him. This has been going on since he got the nomination, but he's still in the race. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=925.5s)]
*  That is shocking. And it's insulting not simply to voters in Pennsylvania, but to the rest of us who, if this guy's elect, will have to live under his rule. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=933.5s)]
*  But the Democratic Party prefers it that way. They did it with Biden. They're trying to begin with Federman. Run a wax dummy for office. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=942.5s)]
*  People who can't form complete sentences apparently seem less threatening to voters. How much damage can he really do? He can't even talk. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=951.5s)]
*  Apparently that's what they think. And of course, people like Federman and Biden are much easier to control. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=958.5s)]
*  So on the one occasion, Federman has actually been asked directly about this. Wait a second. You're cognitively impaired. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=965.5s)]
*  How did he respond as a victim, of course? If you've got a problem with a brain damage senator, you're a bigot. Watch this. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=971.5s)]
*  I would like to think that Dr. Oz may have really lost his way if you're going to make fun of somebody that had a stroke. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=995.5s)]
*  Oh, making fun of people. How dare you do that? He's disabled. Shut up. Accept it. How dare you acknowledge the obvious? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1002.5s)]
*  You have no right. This is all about John Federman's personal journey. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1012.5s)]
*  So you're not allowed to ask, well, how does this affect me if that guy who can't think clearly is elected to the United States Senate? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1018.5s)]
*  That's impolite. They do this on so many issues, and they're doing it with him. And it works. Most people just shut up. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1024.5s)]
*  It's considered completely out of bounds to mention the fact that John Federman is completely incapable of representing Pennsylvania in the United States Senate. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1031.5s)]
*  And as we said, that fact, and it is a fact, is fine with the people who run the Democratic Party. They just want the power. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1040.5s)]
*  But the rest of us should be very worried by this. If they can get this guy elected statewide in this nation's fifth largest state, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1046.5s)]
*  this guy in incompetent husk with incredibly stupid and totally provably destructive ideas, a man with no record of achievement at all, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1056.5s)]
*  a man with a long list of documented failures, a man who, by the way, cannot even think clearly. If they can do that, they can do literally anything. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1066.5s)]
*  Anything. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB7VA-uP7BU&t=1075.5s)]
