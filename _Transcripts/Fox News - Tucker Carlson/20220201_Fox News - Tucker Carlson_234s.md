# White House picks aspiring musician to fix this crisis
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY)
*  More people living on American streets than any time in 100 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=0.0s)]
*  It's getting very noticeable. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=3.84s)]
*  It's obviously a sign of decay. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=5.36s)]
*  It's scary, actually. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=7.28s)]
*  So Joe Biden has finally named someone to be his new homelessness czar. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=8.28s)]
*  Turns out the problem is we're all too transphobic. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  That's why we have the homeless. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=15.64s)]
*  So Biden has appointed an aspiring musician called Jeff Olivett. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=16.8s)]
*  Jason Rantz has been looking into Mr. Olivett. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=21.84s)]
*  Jason Rantz is the host of the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=24.72s)]
*  It will always happen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=28.0s)]
*  Join us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=29.0s)]
*  Jason, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=30.0s)]
*  Who is this guy? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=31.32s)]
*  He is someone who is deeply unimpressive and a long established member of the homeless [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=32.32s)]
*  industrial complex. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=38.16s)]
*  He most recently became an anti-racist consultant who tells white people to curb their white [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=39.16s)]
*  privilege, which is ironic because he probably used that to land this new job. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=43.84s)]
*  So all that basically views homelessness through a critical race theory and social justice [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=47.56s)]
*  Which basically means he blames homelessness on racism because the homeless population [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=54.72s)]
*  is disproportionately black. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=58.96s)]
*  So what he's basically saying is, look, if you're black, if you have a mental illness [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=60.48s)]
*  or an addiction and you're homeless, he says it's because of institutional racism in the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=64.44s)]
*  health care system that didn't give you affordable health care treatment to begin with that led [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=69.32s)]
*  you to become homeless. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=73.6s)]
*  Are you freaking serious? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=74.6s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=75.6s)]
*  Is there any end to these people? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=78.16s)]
*  They just stopped breaking things? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=79.88s)]
*  Are you fairly characterizing this guy's views? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  Because it's like, how much more of this can we take? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, I was in the same way. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=86.68s)]
*  I've been looking over and over a lot of his interviews and it's pretty clear where he [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  stands. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=93.76s)]
*  He's basically saying, look, if you're going to end racism, you have to get at the root [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=94.76s)]
*  causes and then that turns into ending homelessness. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=98.84s)]
*  And he actually explains what needs to happen, he says, in this interview here with a nonprofit [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=101.68s)]
*  called Family Promise. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=105.56s)]
*  If we don't pull it out by the root, if we don't address the deep structural underlying [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=108.04s)]
*  racism that is driving high rates of homelessness for people of color and families of color, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  then there's no way we'll ever end it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  So that doesn't actually explain why white people are homeless or Asians or Latinos, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=123.0s)]
*  but it's not a priority for this White House. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=127.28s)]
*  So moving forward, this is what we can expect. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=128.68s)]
*  He's going to pour billions of dollars into a housing first strategy, which kind of functions [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  the way it sounds. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=135.24s)]
*  The homeless get housed first, meaning there's no conditions on the housing, like getting [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=136.4s)]
*  addiction treatment so you're not shooting up in the subsidized home. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=140.54000000000002s)]
*  And usually proponents will look to Salt Lake City because they use this model. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=144.56s)]
*  And it's been really effective in getting like 95 percent of the homeless people that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  they get into contact with into housing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=151.28s)]
*  However, the studies show they don't actually become self-sufficient. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=153.52s)]
*  So that's in part because of the underlying conditions that are never treated successfully. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=157.56s)]
*  So using this approach nationally basically means you're going to be spending billions [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  of dollars on housing and case management where the homeless never actually leave. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=165.96s)]
*  And so your question, which I think is a legitimate one, is how did someone like this get to this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=172.28s)]
*  position? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  And maybe it has nothing to do with homelessness. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Maybe it's the other skills. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=181.58s)]
*  Maybe you can entertain the White House interns. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=183.0s)]
*  But you know exactly what's going on. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=184.44s)]
*  It's the same gig all the time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  You blame Whitey and then you take money from developers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=188.16s)]
*  So this is a payoff to developers, of course. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  So we're going to build a lot more multi-family housing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=193.68s)]
*  Developers are going to get rich all under the cover of wokeness. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=198.28s)]
*  Like we're onto the game now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  It's clear as day and we know exactly how much money they're going to be putting into [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=207.72s)]
*  It is absolutely ludicrous. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=208.72s)]
*  And people better step up because otherwise all we're doing is creating a situation where [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=209.72s)]
*  they never actually get out of the homelessness. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=215.84s)]
*  It doesn't help anybody except the developers, of course. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=216.84s)]
*  Jason Rantz, great to see you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaidZJZlcY&t=219.08s)]
