# Tucker: Are Black White House staffers fleeing for their lives?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk)
*  But the headline here is that the white supremacy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Biden White House is so intense, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=2.6s)]
*  21 black staffers, can there be more than 21 total? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=5.24s)]
*  Not a huge staff at the White House. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=10.16s)]
*  21 black staffers have fled. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=11.76s)]
*  Speaking of the new Jim Crow, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=14.9s)]
*  Candace Owens is the founder of the charity, Blexit. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=16.68s)]
*  She's probably not surprised by this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=18.68s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=20.0s)]
*  Candace, are you surprised at the racism, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=21.04s)]
*  the white supremacy at the White House is so intense [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=23.32s)]
*  that black staffers are fleeing for their lives? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=26.84s)]
*  I have to say I'm a little bit upset [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=30.8s)]
*  that I'm not involved in these strategy sessions [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=32.24s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=34.3s)]
*  I just picture them all sitting around a table [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=35.14s)]
*  and just quick, quick, black people are waking up [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=37.12s)]
*  and they're not happy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=39.64s)]
*  Grab me an Asian and put them in front of the podium. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=40.6s)]
*  We've got to shift here [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=42.92s)]
*  and shift gears completely on the PR strategy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=44.28s)]
*  I mean, this is actually what they're doing, right? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=46.16s)]
*  Because black Americans, first and foremost, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=47.84s)]
*  what's happening parallel to this [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=50.04s)]
*  is black Americans are waking up [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=51.32s)]
*  to the lie that was Black Lives Matter. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=52.72s)]
*  So at the same time, you're having these black Americans [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=54.92s)]
*  that were quite literally just given these positions. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=57.08s)]
*  They weren't meant to do anything. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=59.68s)]
*  They never wanted them to actually do anything. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=60.88s)]
*  They probably were under qualified [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  for the positions that they even had. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=64.08s)]
*  But the idea was, oh, look, we're getting on our knees, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=65.52s)]
*  literally, if you're Nancy Pelosi, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=68.24s)]
*  to the Black Lives Matter narrative, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=69.64s)]
*  Remember she did that notorious bow [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=71.36s)]
*  and got down on one knee. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=73.36s)]
*  And we're gonna do this and show you [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=74.6s)]
*  that we're gonna hire a bunch of black people, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=76.16s)]
*  but we don't actually care what they think. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=77.88s)]
*  We just need them to sit there and be black. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=80.06s)]
*  Now the black Americans in the White House [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=82.78s)]
*  are waking up and going, you know what? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  That's not okay with me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=85.36s)]
*  And they're frantically searching [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=86.78s)]
*  to drum up a new narrative of hate. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=89.28s)]
*  And this one's gonna be Asian American, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=90.64s)]
*  Asian Lives Matter, quick, grab me K-pop, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=92.72s)]
*  and hopefully America's going to fall for this [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=95.56s)]
*  when in reality we're focused on the gas prices, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=98.08s)]
*  the inflation prices, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=101.16s)]
*  and it's just an absolute complete joke. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=102.6s)]
*  Is there anything more destructive [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=105.24s)]
*  than white liberal guilt? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=106.88s)]
*  It feels like it's hurt more people than nuclear weapons. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=108.12s)]
*  It really has. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=112.0s)]
*  And people are starting to see that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  Even Patrice Colors, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=114.24s)]
*  The person who started Black Lives Matter [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=116.12s)]
*  just basically said, well, it's not my fault [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=117.72s)]
*  that you guys gave me your white guilty dollars [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=119.16s)]
*  and I lied about what I did with it [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=121.28s)]
*  and bought myself an entire real estate empire. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=122.72s)]
*  And that's the truth. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=125.08s)]
*  So it's not just black Americans [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=125.92s)]
*  that need to have an awakening, it's white Americans. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=127.28s)]
*  You know, you have to stop allowing people [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=129.68s)]
*  to manipulate you emotionally [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=131.4s)]
*  and tell you that you're a bad person [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=132.84s)]
*  just because you're born a certain color. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=134.6s)]
*  And hopefully we're gonna start to see that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=136.56s)]
*  as we head into this election cycle. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=138.2s)]
*  People who hate themselves are not good leaders. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=140.46s)]
*  Weak men and unhappy women. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=142.6s)]
*  I agree. That's the Democratic party. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=144.0s)]
*  Candace Owens. Absolutely. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=145.24s)]
*  Neither one of them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=146.44s)]
*  Great to see you tonight. Thank you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=147.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXvW_Gc_6nk&t=149.6s)]
