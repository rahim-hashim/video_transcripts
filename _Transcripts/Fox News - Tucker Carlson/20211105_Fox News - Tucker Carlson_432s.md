# Will Cain: These are the criminals Joe Biden is welcoming to America
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Will Kane in for Tucker. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=2.72s)]
*  Disturbing phone calls started coming into [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=5.34s)]
*  Jacksonville Sheriff's Police Office on a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=7.48s)]
*  Wednesday night just a few weeks ago. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=9.68s)]
*  Motorists had reported seeing a man [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  covered in blood walking along the highway, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=14.24s)]
*  and then he disappeared into the woods [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=17.18s)]
*  when authorities finally arrested the man. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=19.68s)]
*  The next morning they identified him as [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=22.0s)]
*  a Honduran migrant named Medina Aloha. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Now Aloha claimed to be a teenager. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=27.2s)]
*  Authorities followed the trail of blood [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=30.0s)]
*  left by Medina Aloha to find his victim, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  a 46 year old father of four and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=35.48s)]
*  security cameras showed Aloha stabbing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=38.0s)]
*  the man multiple times in beating him [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=39.92s)]
*  to death with a chair in his own home. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=42.2s)]
*  Just a terrible story. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=44.76s)]
*  Now investigators suspect Aloha [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=46.08s)]
*  was lying about his identity, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=47.36s)]
*  so they checked in with the Honduran [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=48.84s)]
*  consulate and that's when they found [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=51.04s)]
*  out that Medina Aloha is not in fact a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=53.04s)]
*  teenager. He's actually 23 years old [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=56.0s)]
*  and he's in this country illegally. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=58.44s)]
*  So how did he get here? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=60.68s)]
*  It turns out Aloha did not [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=62.68s)]
*  sneak across the border. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=64.56s)]
*  He didn't overstay his visa, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=65.92s)]
*  no instead, according to report [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=67.64s)]
*  in the New York Post, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=69.52s)]
*  Aloha crossed the border under a fake name, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=71.32s)]
*  pretending to be an unaccompanied minor, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=74.48s)]
*  and in keeping with the Biden [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=76.88s)]
*  administration's immigration policies, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=79.16s)]
*  he was led into the country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=80.64s)]
*  He was placed into a shelter and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=82.88s)]
*  then he was released. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  The Biden administration then [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=87.36s)]
*  reportedly put Aloha on a secret [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  resettlement flight to Florida. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  The governor of Florida, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=92.64s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, has called this what it is. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  It's a deliberate effort by the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  Biden administration to endanger [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=99.28s)]
*  American citizens in exchange [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  for political power. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=102.52s)]
*  This individual has been detained, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=104.6s)]
*  should have never been in this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  country to begin with, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=108.88s)]
*  and definitely should not have been [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=110.44s)]
*  dumped in the state of Florida. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  These are middle of the night flights. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=114.8s)]
*  No, no notification to the state or anybody, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=117.44s)]
*  and this is not the way you keep people safe. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  No, it's not. The Biden administration [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  isn't just letting record number of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=127.88s)]
*  illegal immigrants cross our borders. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=129.92s)]
*  They're bringing them here and they're [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=131.76s)]
*  prohibiting immigration authorities [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=134.04s)]
*  from deporting any of them, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=135.48s)]
*  even ones with violent criminal records. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=137.4s)]
*  To be clear, this is against the law. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=139.8s)]
*  Section 236 C of the Immigration [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=143.16s)]
*  and Nationality Act requires ICE [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  to arrest and hold almost all [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=147.32s)]
*  removable criminal aliens. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=149.6s)]
*  Congress passed that law and Joe [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=150.76s)]
*  Biden is simply ignoring it the same [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=152.96s)]
*  way he ignores pesky questions at a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=155.4s)]
*  press conference by turning his [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=158.0s)]
*  back and shuffling away. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=159.88s)]
*  He's shuffling away from this problem. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=161.32s)]
*  Now that's why the state of Texas [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=163.48s)]
*  is currently suing the Biden administration. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=165.56s)]
*  They want the law enforced, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=167.8s)]
*  and as part of that lawsuit, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=169.56s)]
*  they're going to learn much more about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  the kind of people the Biden administration [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=174.16s)]
*  is allowing to stay in this country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=176.72s)]
*  Jason Clark, he's the chief of staff of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=182.16s)]
*  He said in an affidavit attained by this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=184.44s)]
*  show that ICE has rescinded detainers [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  for at least 130 illegal immigrants [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=189.56s)]
*  between January 20th and October 20th. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=191.84s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=194.2s)]
*  Rescinding detainers that means ICE [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=196.04s)]
*  no longer wants to take custody of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=197.84s)]
*  of these illegal immigrants when they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=200.4s)]
*  are released in order to deport them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=202.72s)]
*  I shows no interest is following their [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=205.16s)]
*  orders not to deport these criminals. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=207.56s)]
*  Now look, to give you just an idea [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=209.84s)]
*  of how unprecedented this is, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  no detainers zero were rescinded [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  in this same time period one year ago. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=216.0s)]
*  These aren't just minor criminals [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=218.84s)]
*  were talking about that ICE [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=220.56s)]
*  is refusing to deport. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=222.28s)]
*  Clark's affidavit states that one [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=223.56s)]
*  of the illegal immigrants allowed [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=225.4s)]
*  to stay in this country is a man [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=227.16s)]
*  named Yolando Camacho and he was [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=229.52s)]
*  convicted of intoxicated manslaughter [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  with a vehicle. Another example, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  Charles Mainsa. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  He was in prison for theft of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=236.4s)]
*  property worth more than $2500. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=239.18s)]
*  He was released from Texas [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=241.28s)]
*  custody in February. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=243.36s)]
*  ICE never arrested him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  They dropped his detainer. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=246.36s)]
*  Luis Alar Rodriguez was released [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=248.0s)]
*  from a Texas prison in September. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=250.0s)]
*  He was there for having multiple DWI's [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  and Yulisa Espinosa had her detainer [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  dropped by ICE in March. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=258.08s)]
*  She was locked up for credit card abuse, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=260.08s)]
*  and when police arrested her, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  they found her with card numbers that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=265.2s)]
*  matched 15 different food stamp cards, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=267.8s)]
*  but nothing, nothing tops 24 year old [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=270.2s)]
*  Jose Reyes Reyes was arrested by ICE in 2018. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=273.32s)]
*  He was later released from ICE custody [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=277.36s)]
*  and in less than a year after that, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  Reyes was convicted of drunk driving. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=283.28s)]
*  He was again released and then [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=286.04s)]
*  he decided to become a poet. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=288.48s)]
*  He spoke at an open border protest [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=291.12s)]

*  federal immigration laws. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=296.0s)]
*  Dear America, our administration has failed. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=297.6s)]
*  They passed laws against our people, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  took away our rights and our freedom [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=302.56s)]
*  and still expect to be held. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGok6mZEL4&t=305.28000000000003s)]
