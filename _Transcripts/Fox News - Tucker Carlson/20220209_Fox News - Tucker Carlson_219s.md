# Democrats don't want you to read this controversial Florida bill
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU)
*  Well, a new bill in Florida aims to stop teachers from discussing sex and gender identity with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=0.0s)]
*  young children and not like eighth graders like kindergartners. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=6.22s)]
*  The bill in the Florida Senate covers, well, kindergartners through third grade. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=9.94s)]
*  But you're probably not hearing that from your local news organization. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=14.38s)]
*  They're calling this the don't say gay bill as if it's banning conversation about gay [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=19.22s)]
*  people or sex. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=26.3s)]
*  Here's what they're saying. In your view, is this dangerous legislation? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=29.14s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. And the reason is that it tells youth who are different or whose families are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=34.66s)]
*  different that there's something wrong with them out of the gate. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  He wants to really say that Florida is a free state, but it's only free if you act like him, look like [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=44.34s)]
*  him and a Republican or a cisgender, heterosexual, white Republican man. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=50.94s)]
*  You know, this falls under the rubric of parental rights legislation, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=56.58s)]
*  And it started with CRT. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=60.94s)]
*  Let's remember that. So if you start coming after black people, what comes next? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=62.58s)]
*  Right. Of course, the LGBTQ community and then women and then other marginalized groups. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  So the main trade route between Southern Canada and Michigan, the bridge is shut down right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=72.5s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of dollars stopped on the bridge. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=78.62s)]
*  And our transportation secretary is on TV complaining about a bill in the Florida legislature [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  that would prevent kindergartners from learning about sex. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  Misplaced priorities, anyone? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=92.86000000000001s)]
*  Chabot Moore has been following all of this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=94.9s)]
*  He's the editor in chief of Outspoken. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=96.66000000000001s)]
*  He knows what's in the bill because he's actually read it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=98.38000000000001s)]
*  He joins us tonight. Chabot Moore, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  The hysteria about this seems a little calculated, no? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look, if wacky gay activists, childless, wacky gay activists want to drive the White [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=106.58000000000001s)]
*  House, the Democrat Party, gay media like CNN into this arena of demonizing concerned parents [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=112.38s)]
*  after what happened in Virginia last year, this year now and with the midterms coming up. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  I mean, more power to them. It's a terrible look. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=123.58s)]
*  And like you had mentioned, the bill is four pages long. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=126.3s)]
*  All right. No Democrat has read it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=129.54s)]
*  And if they had, they don't want you to read it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=131.7s)]
*  The media doesn't want you to read it because when you do, you realize it's perfectly [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=133.26s)]
*  reasonable, rational bill that would not even be necessary if parents didn't become so [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=137.5s)]
*  privy to the insane things their teachers were saying to their students during lockdown, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=143.1s)]
*  during remote learning. This bill says basically you can't have classroom wide discussions [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=148.58s)]
*  from five to eight year olds about gender identity and sexual orientation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  You can have one on one discussions. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=158.94s)]
*  Kids can talk about what they will and ask questions about what they will. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=160.86s)]
*  But you can't have discussions with five year olds about switching their gender in a classroom [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=163.98s)]
*  setting in a classroom. What is wrong with this? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=167.86s)]
*  What what, Aaron, has an issue with this? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=170.5s)]
*  None. But they want to demonize it and call it the don't say gay bill. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=172.94s)]
*  You've got Pete Buttigieg's husband saying it's going to kill gay people. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=176.5s)]
*  What are they even talking about? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=180.66s)]
*  It's it's so in another world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=182.46s)]
*  But of course, they don't want you to read it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=184.78s)]
*  They don't want to see how reasonable this is. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=186.02s)]
*  And they don't want to lose any grip they have on the education system. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=188.26s)]
*  They shouldn't be pushing gender propaganda in kindergartners. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=191.74s)]
*  This is all a fundraising opportunity for the human rights campaign, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=194.26s)]
*  which has achieved its goals, but still needs to raise money. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=197.38s)]
*  What a scam. And we're all falling for it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=200.34s)]
*  I appreciate the clarity of what you just said, Chad McMor. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=202.38s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. My pleasure. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5UQePDUMUU&t=204.34s)]
