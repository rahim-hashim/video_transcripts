# Candace Owens: Colleges have become 'criminal enterprises'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8)
*  Candace Owens is the host of the Candace Owens podcast, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=0.0s)]
*  and she has her own ideas for what Stanford might [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  ban on its banned word list. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=5.4s)]
*  It's great to see you tonight, Candace. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=7.8s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Both of us, of course, went to Stanford. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=10.44s)]
*  We met in the computer science department there. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=12.08s)]
*  And so for us, this is personal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  What would you suggest that they ban? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=15.8s)]
*  You know, to be honest, I'm scared to speak. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=17.44s)]
*  I'm not trying to get banned. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  I'm trying to abide by all of the rules, which would probably [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=22.84s)]
*  be easier if you're a student at Stanford, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=25.8s)]
*  if you just kept your mouth shut. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=27.8s)]
*  It just seems like a walking minefield, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=29.64s)]
*  which is ridiculous. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=31.92s)]
*  But I think if we can't beat it, we got to join in. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=32.96s)]
*  We should ban some more words. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=34.96s)]
*  I would say we should ban intelligence, obviously, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  because it's an ableist term. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=39.4s)]
*  They had a whole section for ableism, right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=40.84s)]
*  And of course, intelligence would be ableism. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=42.72s)]
*  It doesn't allow people who don't have thinking brains [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=45.32s)]
*  to be able to join in. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=47.72s)]
*  And clearly, people that created this list [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=48.88s)]
*  do not have thinking brains. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=50.88s)]
*  And what people should be thinking [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=52.68s)]
*  when they see things like this is that college campuses have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=54.0s)]
*  become a criminal enterprise. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=57.68s)]
*  Kids are taking out hundreds and thousands of dollars in loans [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=59.16s)]
*  to attend these universities to be told essentially [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  that they can't speak and that everything that they do is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  wrong. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=66.6s)]
*  I'm not sure at what benefit it is for parents [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=67.24s)]
*  to send their children to university anymore [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=69.96s)]
*  when they come back and they don't even know anything [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  about their own genders. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=74.12s)]
*  They come back dumber than when you sent them, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=75.08s)]
*  Because they see everything as a buzz word, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=77.72s)]
*  everything as a trigger. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=80.08s)]
*  And in the end, they end up as non-productive human beings [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=81.4s)]
*  in society that also have hundreds and thousands [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=84.64s)]
*  of student loan debt and nothing that they're able to do [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  because nobody wants to hire these people, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=90.0s)]
*  these people that are just sensitive crybabies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  What they end up becoming are government dependents, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=93.6s)]
*  angry professors. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=96.36s)]
*  They go back into the ecosystem that taught them [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=97.36s)]
*  the nonsense in the first place. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=99.24s)]
*  I mean, this list is so laughable. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=101.16s)]
*  But you shouldn't laugh because this is coming [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=103.16s)]
*  from Stanford University. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=104.96s)]
*  Stanford, Harvard, Yale, yes, all these pretentious universities [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=107.0s)]
*  supposed to be the best, the smartest, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=110.6s)]
*  the cream of the crop is supposed to be. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=112.52s)]
*  I'm sure we're not allowed to say that, by the way, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  are supposed to be attending these university campuses. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=115.64s)]
*  And this is what they come up with. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=118.16s)]
*  Astounding, Tucker. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=120.36s)]
*  But it's also a cover for them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=121.8s)]
*  So you can't use the term beat it at horse [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=123.28s)]
*  because it's violence against animals. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  As someone who actually loves animals, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=126.32s)]
*  I would be interested to know how many dogs, cats, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  and monkeys have been tortured to death [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=130.04s)]
*  over the years at Stanford because they got [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=131.6s)]
*  some government grant to do it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=133.68s)]
*  Not to advance science, but simply because they got paid [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=135.28s)]
*  to torture those animals to death. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=138.16s)]
*  You think they'll answer that question? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=139.4s)]
*  No, I think what you're gonna be careful here [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=142.4s)]
*  is that could be against the religion of Fauciism. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=144.04s)]
*  And you wanna be very careful not to be anti-Fauci anywhere [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=146.4s)]
*  because God forbid you question any of his morals, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=150.2s)]
*  any of the experience that they've done on animals [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=153.32s)]
*  or the experimentation that they did on human beings [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=155.68s)]
*  and you will land yourself on the wrong side [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=158.04s)]
*  of Stanford University. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=159.64s)]
*  So I'm not as brave as you are, Tucker. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=160.6s)]
*  I wouldn't dare speak against Dr. Fauci. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=162.36s)]
*  I would take a beagle over Fauci any day of the week. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=165.96s)]
*  Candace Owens, great to see you tonight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMoC-FOzP8&t=168.64s)]
