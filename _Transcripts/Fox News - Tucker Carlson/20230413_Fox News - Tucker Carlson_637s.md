# Tucker Carlson: This will make you sick to your stomach
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  For the past 14 months, you have heard two main things about the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=3.88s)]
*  The first is that the war in Ukraine is a war of national sovereignty. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  It is not a proxy battle between superpowers. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=12.08s)]
*  Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=16.36s)]
*  That was immoral. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=17.78s)]
*  The United States supports Ukraine because the United States supports democracy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=18.78s)]
*  But the United States itself is not at war with Russia. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=23.22s)]
*  This is Ukraine's war to fight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  The second thing we have heard over and over again is that Ukraine is winning that war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=28.96s)]
*  Ukrainian troops are brave and noble. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=33.92s)]
*  Russian troops are evil and incompetent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  The Ukrainians are beating the Russians. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=38.64s)]
*  In the end, their victory is inevitable. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=41.28s)]
*  Now you're very familiar with these points because you have heard them every day since [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=44.8s)]
*  last February. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  You've heard them repeated by every power center in the United States, the Pentagon, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=50.84s)]
*  the leaders of both parties in Congress, CEOs and celebrities. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=55.52s)]
*  And most insistently of all, you've heard them from virtually every single outlet along [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  the entire spectrum of our national news media. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=64.08s)]
*  These are the two essential themes of the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  And both of them are lies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  We know that they're lies because late last week, leaked intelligence about the war in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=74.42s)]
*  Ukraine began to appear on social media. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=78.16s)]
*  Briefing slides prepared by the U.S. government began to show up, among other places, on Twitter. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=80.92s)]
*  And the slides show that this is in fact not Ukraine's war. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=86.8s)]
*  It's our war. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=90.28s)]
*  The United States is a direct combatant in a war against Russia. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=91.72s)]
*  As we speak, American soldiers are fighting Russian soldiers. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=95.8s)]
*  So this is not a regional conflict in Eastern Europe. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=100.0s)]
*  This is a hot war between the two primary nuclear superpowers on Earth. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=103.0s)]
*  And yet this war has never been formally declared. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=109.68s)]
*  It has not been authorized by Congress. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  And for that reason, this war is a violation of American law. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=114.64s)]
*  It is a crime. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=117.48s)]
*  The second thing we learn from these slides is that despite direct U.S. involvement, Ukraine [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  is in fact losing the war. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=124.56s)]
*  Seven Ukrainians are being killed for every Russian. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  Ukrainian air defenses have been utterly degraded. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=130.36s)]
*  Ukraine is losing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  The Biden administration is perfectly aware of this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  They're panicked about it, but they have lied about this fact to the public. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=137.72s)]
*  Just two weeks ago, for example, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told the U.S. Senate [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=143.12s)]
*  that Russian military power is, quote, waning. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=147.48s)]
*  In other words, Russia is losing the war. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=150.04s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=153.62s)]
*  He knew it was when he said it, but he repeated it in congressional testimony. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=154.62s)]
*  That is a crime. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=158.86s)]
*  But Lloyd Austin has not been arrested for committing that crime. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=160.44s)]
*  Instead, the only man who has been taken into custody, or likely ever will be, is a 21-year-old [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=163.72s)]
*  Massachusetts Air National Guardsman who leaked the slides that showed that Lloyd Austin was [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=169.12s)]
*  lying. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=174.28s)]
*  He revealed the crimes, therefore he's the criminal. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=175.68s)]
*  That's how Washington works. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  Telling the truth is the only real sin. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=180.68s)]
*  Now our news media exist and have constitutional protection precisely in order to push back [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  against this grotesque standard. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=190.24s)]
*  Their only job is to tell the truth. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=192.92s)]
*  And yet tonight, the news media are celebrating the capture of the kid who told Americans [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=195.88s)]
*  what's actually happening in Ukraine. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=200.32s)]
*  They are treating him like Osama Bin Laden. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  Maybe a little worse, actually, because unlike Al Qaeda, apparently this kid is a racist. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=204.44s)]
*  Here's CNN. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  The Washington Post, as you know, reviewed video of this suspect yelling racial and anti-Semitic [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  slurs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  Is this a dangerous person? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  This Air Guardsman who's now been taken into custody had talked about being a gun enthusiast, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=221.64s)]
*  had been at gun ranges. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=225.64s)]
*  He's obviously a member of the military. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=226.83999999999997s)]
*  And he's the big guy in the scene. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  Somehow he has access to this kind of information and that makes him even larger. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  A person who thinks they know better than everyone else, they're smarter than everyone [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=235.64s)]
*  else in their view. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  And that this is a 21-year-old man. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  He's described as a gun enthusiast. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=242.44s)]
*  So this 21-year-old Air National Guardsman from Massachusetts is not a whistleblower, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=244.48s)]
*  CNN explains, with the help of the many intelligence agency figures it has now hired as analysts. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=257.52s)]
*  No, he's not a whistleblower. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=263.08s)]
*  He's a criminal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=265.64s)]
*  Because he is, unlike the people who run our government, quote, hungry for power. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=267.2s)]
*  And because this 21-year-old was so hungry for power, federal law enforcement had to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=272.08s)]
*  swing into action with unfamiliar speed and efficiency and apprehend him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=276.64s)]
*  He was that threatening. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  Now keep in mind, as of tonight, we still don't know where Jeffrey Epstein got hundreds [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  of millions of dollars. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=288.36s)]
*  We have no idea. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=289.44s)]
*  Nor do we know what he did for a living. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=290.44s)]
*  We don't know who left pipe bombs on Capitol Hill on January 6th. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  Two of them. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=297.44s)]
*  We don't know who leaked the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=298.72s)]
*  We can't even say for certain who killed the President of the United States, because after [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  60 years, the Biden administration is still hiding thousands of pages of classified documents [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  from the Kennedy assassination, just as they are hiding more than a billion other classified [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  documents. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  But tonight, we can say for dead certain who embarrassed Toria Nuland and Joe Biden. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=320.0s)]
*  And that kid is going to jail for a long, long time. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=326.92s)]
*  That's the standard. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=331.04s)]
*  The media are fine with that standard. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=332.04s)]
*  Watch this remarkable exchange on Monday of this week between the White House press corps [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=333.32s)]
*  and Biden flack John Kirby. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  Without confirming the validity of the documents, this is information that has no business in [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  the public domain. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  It has no business, if you don't mind me saying, on the pages of front pages of newspapers [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=347.3s)]
*  or on television. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=353.86s)]
*  It is not intended for public consumption and it should not be out there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=355.64s)]
*  So the fact that U.S. soldiers are fighting Russian soldiers in a war in Ukraine has no [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=362.4s)]
*  business in the public domain. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=371.96s)]
*  The fact that the country we are backing and fighting alongside is losing, not winning, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=374.56s)]
*  has no business in the public domain. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=380.44s)]
*  You have no right to know what your government is doing in your name with your tax dollars [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=382.12s)]
*  and with the future of your children and grandchildren. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=388.08s)]
*  You have no right to know. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=390.54s)]
*  Shut up and stop asking relevant questions. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=391.54s)]
*  Okay, said the media. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=393.76s)]
*  And if you want to get really sick to your stomach, go pull a transcript from the Pentagon [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=396.0s)]
*  briefing today where news reporters asked flacks from the Pentagon, what are we going [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=400.36s)]
*  to do to keep information like this secret in the future? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=407.2s)]
*  Now one question about the substance of the information, we're fighting a war against [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=410.6s)]
*  Russia directly, really? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  Don't they have the largest nuclear arsenal in the world? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  Not one question. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  How can we help you keep it secret? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  Those were the questions. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=422.76000000000005s)]
*  And not only are the media covering up the substance of the story, which is not who leaked [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=424.16s)]
*  it, but what he leaked, they're covering up the crimes committed to get you this information. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=431.0s)]
*  The administration apparently used illegal surveillance techniques to identify this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=437.2s)]
*  kid, apparently with the help of the Washington Post and the New York Times, who are its accomplices. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=440.68s)]
*  They're not holding government accountable. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=445.4s)]
*  They're helping government keep you from knowing what government is doing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=447.14s)]
*  Today the Washington Post reported it had exclusively obtained some of the classified [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=451.44s)]
*  documents this leaker possessed. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=455.28s)]
*  Quote, the Post also reviewed approximately 300 photos of classified documents, most of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=457.12s)]
*  which have not been made public. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=463.12s)]
*  So the text documents the leaker is said to have written out. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=465.12s)]
*  So we've got two problems here. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=469.58s)]
*  If it's illegal to see these documents, if you don't have a security clearance, how is [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=471.92s)]
*  the Washington Post doing this legally? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=475.08s)]
*  They don't have a security clearance. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=477.12s)]
*  Well, obviously they were given them by the US intel agencies and are working alongside [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=478.12s)]
*  them. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=482.12s)]
*  But the bigger problem is this is information that's relevant to the public in a so-called [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=483.3s)]
*  democracy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=487.48s)]
*  You can't lie about things that jeopardize our collective future and get away with it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=489.24s)]
*  And you certainly shouldn't be doing that with the assistance of the news media. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=494.48s)]
*  The news media whose job it is to inform you of what your government is doing. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=499.0s)]
*  But instead they are working actively late into the night to lie to you on behalf of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=503.98s)]
*  their masters in permanent Washington. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=508.82s)]
*  And by the way, just last week the plan was to lie in an even more grotesque way and blame [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=510.44s)]
*  Russia for this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=515.64s)]
*  And we're quoting, Russia or pro-Russian elements are likely behind the leak of several classified [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  US military documents posted on social media that offer a partial month old snapshot of [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=522.44s)]
*  the war in Ukraine. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=527.32s)]
*  Three US officials told Reuters on Friday. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=528.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=532.36s)]
*  Who are these officials who lied to Reuters? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=533.36s)]
*  Then Reuters just of course obediently reprinted their lies as they always do. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=535.76s)]
*  News agencies print what they are told to print by the intel agencies no matter how [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=541.48s)]
*  ridiculous it is. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=545.94s)]
*  No matter how much dignity and self-respect they exchange in return for doing it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=548.0s)]
*  So what's happening to the sleeker now is what happens to anyone who contradicts the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=554.08s)]
*  national security state and their obedient servants in the media. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=558.56s)]
*  You go to prison. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=561.9s)]
*  So the media can continue to tell you lies. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=563.94s)]
*  Here's MSNBC for example assuring its viewers that everything's just fine. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=567.36s)]
*  What the Russians didn't understand was that they were going into the lion's den. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=572.72s)]
*  That kind of what we would say in the military, this force multiply made the Ukrainian army [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=577.76s)]
*  quite literally unbeatable. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=586.28s)]
*  They are winning. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=588.5400000000001s)]
*  Russia is going to lose this war. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=590.0400000000001s)]
*  Every last person has said exactly what Malcolm just said. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=592.28s)]
*  They're going to win this war. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=595.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not a matter of if but when. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=596.28s)]
*  14 months in they are simultaneously telling you that Ukraine's victory is inevitable [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=601.28s)]
*  mostly because of the moral power they possess. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=608.04s)]
*  But at the same time you need to send tens or hundreds of billions of dollars more in [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=611.0s)]
*  advanced weapons systems to Ukraine to keep them from losing. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=616.0799999999999s)]
*  What will they say now that we know the truth and that we know that they lied to us not [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=620.28s)]
*  just the US government but the US news media. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzpCKjl8OxQ&t=623.72s)]
