# Tucker Carlson: What is going on here?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=0.0s)]
*  Peter Navarro is the picture [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  of a law abiding American citizen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=4.92s)]
*  He's a 72 year old retired business school professor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=6.72s)]
*  He's got a PhD in economics from Harvard University. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=9.76s)]
*  His most recent job was extremely white collar. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=13.0s)]
*  He served as the White House trade advisor [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=15.22s)]
*  in the last presidential administration, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  famous for his tough stance on China. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=20.44s)]
*  He's never been charged with a crime. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=22.8s)]
*  He's never trafficked fentanyl, for example, for Mexico. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=24.48s)]
*  In fact, his hobby is yoga and riding his bicycle. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=26.86s)]
*  In short, Peter Navarro does not seem like a criminal, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=30.58s)]
*  much less a danger to this nation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=32.78s)]
*  And yet, last Friday, federal agents arrested Peter Navarro [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=34.62s)]
*  at Reagan National Airport in Washington. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  They did not call his lawyer [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=42.06s)]
*  as his customary in cases like this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=43.22s)]
*  They didn't even come to his house, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=45.68s)]
*  which as it happens is just feet from the FBI building. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  They could have walked, but they didn't. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=49.54s)]
*  Instead, they took down Peter Navarro in public, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=51.46s)]
*  as you would a fugitive terror mastermind. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  So everyone could see it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=56.3s)]
*  and learn the lesson they were sending. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=58.14s)]
*  They handcuffed Peter Navarro. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  They put him in leg irons, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=61.86s)]
*  and then they threw him in a cell. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=62.94s)]
*  He's now facing years in prison. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=65.38s)]
*  So what did Peter Navarro do [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=68.06s)]
*  to deserve treatment like this? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, he resisted a subpoena from the January 6th committee. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=71.86s)]
*  The January 6th committee [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=75.9s)]
*  is Washington's latest partisan inquisition. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=76.86s)]
*  It's run by Nancy Pelosi, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  with help from obedient little quizlings [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=80.62s)]
*  like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  Navarro resisted that subpoena [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=85.22000000000001s)]
*  because he had nothing to do with January 6th, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=86.9s)]
*  nothing whatsoever. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=90.36000000000001s)]
*  That's not disputed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=91.9s)]
*  Peter Navarro did not break into the Capitol. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=93.26s)]
*  He didn't encourage anyone else to break into the Capitol. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  He wasn't even there that day. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=97.86000000000001s)]
*  He had no idea it was going to happen. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  Again, that's beyond dispute, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  and Nancy Pelosi and Liz Cheney know that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=103.18s)]
*  If you really wanted to figure out [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=106.66000000000001s)]
*  what happened on January 6th, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=108.18s)]
*  Peter Navarro would be the last person you would talk to. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  Instead, you'd be talking to Ray Epps [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=112.9s)]
*  and various FBI informants. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=114.58s)]
*  But finding out what happened on January 6th [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=117.0s)]
*  and why is not the point of the exercise. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=119.16s)]
*  The point of the exercise is preventing Donald Trump [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=121.44s)]
*  from running for president again. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=124.9s)]
*  So in the service of that goal, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=127.46s)]
*  Pelosi and Liz Cheney demanded [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=128.9s)]
*  that Peter Navarro surrender records [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=130.42s)]
*  of his private conversations [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=132.18s)]
*  with his former boss, President Donald Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=133.6s)]
*  And when he refused to do that, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=136.3s)]
*  Congress voted to hold him in contempt in a partisan vote, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=137.66s)]
*  and then Merrick Garland's Justice Department [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=140.62s)]
*  filed criminal charges against Peter Navarro. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=142.22s)]
*  This is not the way civilized countries operate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=145.9s)]
*  Just because you control the White House [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=149.78s)]
*  and both houses of Congress [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=151.7s)]
*  does not mean you get to throw [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=153.06s)]
*  your political opponents behind bars. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=154.5s)]
*  That's not what we do in America, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=157.22s)]
*  that's what they do in Haiti. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=158.5s)]
*  But that's what we're doing now, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=160.7s)]
*  and Peter Navarro is not the first. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=162.16s)]
*  Biden's Justice Department also arrested [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=164.14s)]
*  former Trump advisor, Steve Bannon, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=166.04s)]
*  for a similar fake crime. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=167.74s)]
*  Steve Bannon is awaiting trial this summer. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=170.1s)]
*  So this is not something we've seen before, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=173.42s)]
*  it's a huge step toward the politics of the third world. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=175.78s)]
*  But the media, whose job you thought it was, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=179.14s)]
*  to push back against power, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  are not there in fact applauding [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=182.66s)]
*  because it turns out no punishment is too severe [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=184.22s)]
*  for those who disagree with the national news media. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=187.5s)]
*  Watch them gloat. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=190.7s)]
*  What happened to Peter Navarro [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=192.78s)]
*  is what should have happened to Peter Navarro. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=194.26s)]
*  He was indicted. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=196.45999999999998s)]
*  And when you're indicted, you're arrested. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=197.9s)]
*  What Peter Navarro did, it was so far out of bounds, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=200.46s)]
*  it's so indefensible. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=203.18s)]
*  This prosecution is really about punishing Navarro [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=204.5s)]
*  based on his blatant disrespect [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=207.94s)]
*  for the congressional subpoena. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=210.34s)]
*  So they really are your enemies, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=213.66s)]
*  they're not covering the news, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  they're plotting ways to hurt you, that's true. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=216.1s)]
*  Congressional subpoenas are not optional, they lecture you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=220.46s)]
*  Comply with them or go to jail, that's the message. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  The lawyers on television are sending. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=226.7s)]
*  So let's pretend for a moment that that was true, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=229.14s)]
*  though it's in fact not true. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=231.06s)]
*  If there was in fact a law like that, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=233.06s)]
*  for that law to be legitimate, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=234.98s)]
*  it would have to be like all laws [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=236.76s)]
*  applied equally across the board. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  And no less than the attorney general himself [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=240.94s)]
*  has said that again and again and again. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  I came to work here, he said, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=245.82s)]
*  because we're committed to the rule of law [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=247.33999999999997s)]
*  and to seeking equal justice under the law. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  That was Merrick Garland in January. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=251.82s)]
*  We conduct every investigation [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  guided by the same norms. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=256.02s)]
*  Now those are the norms under which this country [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=259.06s)]
*  has lived for 250 years. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=261.85999999999996s)]
*  It's not justice unless it's applied [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  equally to all adult American citizens, period. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=265.7s)]
*  Anything less than that is by definition not justice. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=269.06s)]
*  But we're getting much less than that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=272.96s)]
*  And it's very obvious. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=274.38s)]
*  Here's just one example. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=275.44s)]
*  10 years ago this month, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=277.32s)]
*  Congress voted overwhelmingly on a bipartisan vote, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=278.88s)]
*  vote by the way, 17 Democrats, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=281.58s)]
*  to hold Eric Holder, then the attorney general, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=283.66s)]
*  in criminal contempt of Congress. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  Holder had refused to turn over documents [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=288.94s)]
*  showing how the Obama administration [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=291.38000000000005s)]
*  had armed the Mexican drug cartels. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=293.24s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  One of the firearms they sent to Mexico [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=296.74s)]
*  under the so-called Fast and Furious program [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  was then used to murder a US border patrol officer. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=300.76000000000005s)]
*  It was a scandal at the time, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  in case you don't recall, watch. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=305.24s)]
*  Border patrol agent Brian Terry died in December 2010, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=307.58000000000004s)]
*  killed by guns tied to an Obama administration plan [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=310.92s)]
*  that armed Mexicans. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=314.26s)]
*  A scandal officials tried to hide [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=315.8s)]
*  by wrongly claiming executive privilege. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  Emails contained in the House Oversight Committee's report [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=320.2s)]
*  show top officials knew the ATF sent guns to Mexico [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=322.76s)]
*  even before Terry's death. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=326.14000000000004s)]
*  Even the border patrol, which sent Terry's team [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=327.76s)]
*  into the desert, didn't know about the operation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=329.94s)]
*  So that was a legitimate scandal [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=334.1s)]
*  that implicated the entire US government, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  people who actually have power, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=339.84s)]
*  not the retirees sitting in jail [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  because of what they did on January 6th, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  but people with actual power. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=345.32s)]
*  And Eric Holder was the very center of it, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=347.0s)]
*  but Holder refused to comply with a subpoena [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=349.2s)]
*  from the Congress. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=352.28s)]
*  Did the FBI arrest Eric Holder for that? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=353.44s)]
*  Please. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=356.35999999999996s)]
*  It was never even seriously considered. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=357.2s)]
*  Holder asserted executive privilege, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=359.55999999999995s)]
*  the right to have conversations with the executive, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=362.0s)]
*  the president, that are private. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=364.28s)]
*  He cited the longstanding policy [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=366.76s)]
*  of respecting executive privilege, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  and he got away with it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=373.74s)]
*  So a week ago, Peter Navarro made this exact point. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=375.52s)]
*  He sued the Justice Department [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=378.52s)]
*  pushing back against the subpoena [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=380.36s)]
*  four days before he was arrested. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  And in that suit, Navarro cited policy [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  written by the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=386.44s)]
*  That policy reads this way, quote, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=388.84s)]
*  "'Since the 1970s, this office has consistently advised [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=390.84s)]
*  that the president and his immediate advisors [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=394.36s)]
*  are absolutely immune from testimonial compulsion [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=396.8s)]
*  by congressional committee on matters [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=400.12s)]
*  related to their official duties." [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=402.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=404.04s)]
*  In other words, if somebody asserts executive privilege, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  at the very least, Congress doesn't get to arrest them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  Before anyone is arrested, they have to go to a judge [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=412.8s)]
*  to rule on whether or not executive privilege [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  is valid in this case. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened in Eric Holder's case. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=419.56s)]
*  And by the way, the federal judge rejected [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  Eric Holder's executive privilege claim, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=423.6s)]
*  and still he was not arrested. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=425.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=427.6s)]
*  You know why. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=428.56s)]
*  Because he's a leading Democrat. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=430.06s)]
*  But in Peter Navarro's case, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=432.64s)]
*  Merrick Garland's DOJ did not even bother to ask a judge. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=434.48s)]
*  They just arrested Peter Navarro at National Airport. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=437.8s)]
*  So what we're seeing here isn't really about Peter Navarro [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=442.92s)]
*  or Steve Bannon. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=446.2s)]
*  What we're seeing is a massive escalation [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=447.02s)]
*  in the use by the Democratic Party of our justice system [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=449.8s)]
*  for partisan revenge. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=453.64s)]
*  That's exactly what that was. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=455.88s)]
*  Peter Navarro wouldn't shut up, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  so they threw him in handcuffs. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=459.04s)]
*  And in fact, at the same moment, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=461.48s)]
*  Peter Navarro was thrown in jail [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=463.0s)]
*  for asserting executive privilege. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=464.48s)]
*  A Clinton lawyer called Michael Sussman [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=466.48s)]
*  was acquitted by a jury seated by an Obama-appointed judge. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=468.2s)]
*  Three of the jurors in that case [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=471.8s)]
*  gave money to Hillary Clinton's campaign, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=473.16s)]
*  and not surprisingly, those same jurors [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=474.8s)]
*  declined to punish Michael Sussman for lying to the FBI [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  to advance the Russia collusion myth [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=479.48s)]
*  that helped Hillary Clinton's campaign. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=481.88s)]
*  Following all this, how'd those jurors get on the jury? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  How'd they stay there? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=487.44s)]
*  Now, the FBI pretended to be outraged [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=489.26s)]
*  by the fact that Michael Sussman had lied to them, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=491.16s)]
*  but then we learned actually the FBI was working [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=493.6s)]
*  with Michael Sussman and his law firm, Perkins-Coy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=496.48s)]
*  Perkins-Coy had an FBI workspace [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=500.56s)]
*  in its offices in Washington for a decade, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=502.72s)]
*  and Michael Sussman was so close to the FBI, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=506.52s)]
*  he had a key card to FBI headquarters. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=509.76s)]
*  We know this from a recently released text exchange. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=512.76s)]
*  We're quoting, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=515.42s)]

*  Really, you had no idea? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=644.36s)]
*  Because they were with you. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=645.84s)]
*  They helped you. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=647.72s)]
*  You committed a gun felony. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=649.48s)]

*  But Hunter Biden is the president's son, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=654.24s)]
*  and more importantly, he's a faithful party loyalist. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=656.36s)]
*  So you know, as well as he does, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=659.08s)]
*  he doesn't have a thing to worry about. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=660.72s)]
*  In fact, he can flaunt his crimes. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=662.2s)]
*  RadarOnline.com just got pictures [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=663.88s)]

*  as he cavorted with a prostitute several years ago. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=669.76s)]

*  on the trigger of the gun, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=674.62s)]
*  as well as crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=675.72s)]
*  Hmm, a weapon of war in the hands of a drug addict. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=678.08s)]
*  Is the Justice Department bothered by this? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=681.86s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=683.4200000000001s)]
*  You know what bothers the Justice Department quite a bit? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=685.86s)]
*  Defying the Democratic Party. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=688.22s)]
*  Do that, and your house gets raided by a SWAT team [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=690.34s)]
*  that tips off CNN before it happens. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=693.46s)]

*  They arrived before dawn there, before 6 a.m., [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=711.42s)]
*  or just after 6 a.m., a dozen officers were told. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=714.54s)]
*  So that's the actual norm. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=723.0999999999999s)]
*  If you were Tony Podesta [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=725.66s)]
*  and you work for the Democratic Party, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=727.5s)]
*  you're totally fine. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=728.8199999999999s)]
*  Nothing you do is gonna get you in trouble, and you know it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=729.66s)]
*  If you're Roger Stone, you've done nothing wrong at all, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=732.5799999999999s)]
*  but you've given the finger to the Democratic Party, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=734.66s)]
*  they show up at your house with guns. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=737.26s)]
*  That's the norm the Attorney General is upholding. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=739.14s)]
*  Serve the Democratic Party, and you will be rewarded, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=743.02s)]
*  even if you're a felon. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=746.46s)]
*  At almost exactly the moment [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=748.54s)]
*  the DOJ was putting Peter Navarro in shackles, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=749.9399999999999s)]
*  the DOJ was also dropping the most serious charges [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=752.74s)]
*  against the two left-wing lawyers [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=755.5s)]
*  who tried to incinerate cops, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=757.02s)]
*  burn them to death in their patrol cars [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=758.78s)]
*  during the BLM riots. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=760.9399999999999s)]
*  Now this pair had faced 30 years in jail [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=762.54s)]
*  on terrorism charges, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=764.8199999999999s)]
*  but that was too tough for the Biden DOJ. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=765.9399999999999s)]
*  They'll be out in a couple, max. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=768.26s)]
*  Why? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=770.74s)]
*  Because they've got the right politics. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=771.58s)]
*  And Liz Cheney's not giving you a lecture [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=773.1s)]
*  about people who try to burn police officers to death [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=774.7s)]

*  No, they're fine, we're just gonna ignore them. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=778.8199999999999s)]
*  It never happened. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=779.98s)]
*  This happens all the time. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=782.1s)]
*  In California, at the height of the BLM riots, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=783.3s)]
*  a career felon called Tony Walker [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=785.38s)]
*  executed a 19-year-old Berkeley student called Seth Smith, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=787.7s)]
*  walked up for no reason, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=791.26s)]
*  never seen him before in his life, and executed him, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=792.58s)]
*  fired a gun into the back of his head. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=794.98s)]
*  Why did he do this? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=796.58s)]
*  Because of his skin color. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=797.42s)]
*  It was a racially motivated attack. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=798.54s)]
*  F that white MF'er, Walker said. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=800.62s)]
*  No one denies that, he said that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=803.06s)]
*  But here's the interesting thing. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=805.18s)]
*  A guy's just executed on the street [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=806.3s)]
*  because he's got the wrong skin color. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=807.42s)]
*  Sounds like a hate crime, right? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=808.4599999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=810.3s)]
*  Merrick Garland's DOJ did not pursue hate crime charges. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=811.2199999999999s)]
*  In fact, a month ago, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=814.9s)]
*  prosecutors caught an unbelievable deal with Walker. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=816.8199999999999s)]
*  They sentenced him on a single charge of, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=820.42s)]
*  brace yourself, voluntary manslaughter. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=822.62s)]
*  F that white MF'er, he said, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=826.26s)]
*  is he executed a college student. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=828.4200000000001s)]
*  That sounds like voluntary manslaughter. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=830.46s)]
*  This is a dangerous trend, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=833.5400000000001s)]
*  and not just because people are dying. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=834.74s)]
*  Nothing destroys the legitimacy of our institutions [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=836.78s)]
*  more than politicized law enforcement. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=839.5s)]
*  You can't have that. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=842.12s)]
*  Justice must be blind. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=843.5400000000001s)]
*  If there is a single institution we have to preserve [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=844.94s)]
*  for the sake of our children and grandchildren, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=847.74s)]
*  it's our justice system [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=850.46s)]
*  and the law enforcement agencies that serve it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=852.1s)]
*  They can't be corrupt. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=854.86s)]
*  If they're corrupt, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=857.18s)]
*  it's gonna be pretty hard to live here. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=858.02s)]
*  Liz Cheney and Nancy Pelosi [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=859.8599999999999s)]
*  and the rest of the lunatics on the January 6th committee [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=861.8199999999999s)]

*  Another trying to make it worse. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  Axios is reporting that some members of the committee, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=872.2199999999999s)]
*  quote, want big changes on voting rights [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=874.5s)]
*  and even to abolish the electoral college. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=877.3399999999999s)]
*  Abolishing the electoral college. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=880.8599999999999s)]
*  And if you're against that, of course, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=883.62s)]
*  you're undermining democracy. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=885.18s)]
*  Was it a conspiracy? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=887.9799999999999s)]
*  I think certainly, I mean, look, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=889.42s)]
*  if you look at the court filings, you look at- [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=891.2199999999999s)]
*  Do you believe it was a conspiracy? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=894.2199999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=895.7399999999999s)]
*  It is extremely broad. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=896.5799999999999s)]
*  It's extremely well-organized. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=898.54s)]
*  It's really chilling. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=900.3399999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's really chilling. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=904.26s)]
*  What's really chilling is when the committee [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=905.16s)]
*  gets to arrest people, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=907.5799999999999s)]
*  not because they violated meaningful laws [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=908.9799999999999s)]
*  or pose a threat to the United States, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=911.26s)]
*  but because their politics are unacceptable [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=913.9s)]
*  because they have given the finger [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=918.6s)]
*  to people like Liz Cheney. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=921.1s)]
*  Is Liz Cheney okay with that? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=922.1s)]
*  The upholder of democracy. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=923.6999999999999s)]
*  We texted Liz Cheney on Friday and said, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=924.78s)]
*  are you okay with this? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=926.5799999999999s)]
*  They just arrested a 72 year old man who did nothing wrong. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=928.34s)]
*  Doesn't that cross some kind of line? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=931.88s)]
*  Are you gonna stand up and say something about it? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=933.38s)]
*  She didn't respond. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=936.18s)]

*  on Thursday night. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lag8WSbk5B0&t=947.18s)]
