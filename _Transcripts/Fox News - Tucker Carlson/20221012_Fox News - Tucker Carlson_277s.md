# Sen. Lee calls out Mitt Romney for remaining neutral: Help me win re-election
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc)
*  I want to bring you a story that you may not be aware of as well, and that is that some prominent Republicans in Washington actually don't want to win in November. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=0.0s)]
*  It seems really important to you, maybe for the future of the country, but some of them are actively trying to lose. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Mitt Romney is one of them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=13.3s)]
*  He is working against his fellow Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee in his re-election campaign. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=15.74s)]
*  Seems like a big story, not getting a ton of coverage. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=22.18s)]
*  Senator Mike Lee joins us tonight. Senator, thank you very much for coming on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=24.3s)]
*  So your race, which I haven't been really paying attention to, but I just started reading about it, you are being painted as some sort of dangerous extremist, which I can see firsthand you are not. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=28.54s)]
*  And you have your fellow Utah Republican Senator working against you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  Like, how did this happen? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=44.1s)]
*  Well, he's explained that he's got two friends in this race. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=46.42s)]
*  When he first told me that, my reaction was, who's the other friend? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=49.06s)]
*  And that he therefore wants to remain neutral. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=52.26s)]
*  Look, I understand it. I respect it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  Here's what's going on. My opponent, Evan McMohen, is a Democrat running in disguise. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=55.78s)]
*  So I understand the commitment made by my colleague, and I work with him, I like him, but here's the deal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=61.5s)]
*  I don't think Mitt Romney wants Chuck Schumer to continue to be the Senate Majority Leader. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=69.18s)]
*  If I'm right on that, then he's get on board because that's exactly what he will be producing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=74.58s)]
*  That's exactly what this will lead to. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=78.98s)]
*  If Utah gets tricked into electing Evan McMohen, a closeted Democrat, into the United States Senate, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=81.18s)]
*  and so as soon as Mitt Romney is ready to, I will eagerly accept his endorsement. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=87.9s)]
*  He's got a big family, and I'd encourage all of them to go to LeaveForSenate.com and make donations to my campaign, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=91.7s)]
*  as Evan McMohen is raising millions of dollars off of ActBlue, the Democratic donor database, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=97.06s)]
*  based on this idea that he's going to defeat me and help perpetuate the Democratic majority. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=103.7s)]
*  So maybe you don't want to say this, maybe you're not even aware of it, but I believe it is true [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=108.78s)]
*  that members of Mitt Romney's immediate family, his nuclear family, are actively helping McMohen against you. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=113.06s)]
*  So is it possible to just call Mitt Romney, whom I know you've known probably your whole life, and say, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=119.78s)]
*  please, like there's a lot at stake here? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=125.74s)]
*  Well, I've asked him, I'm asking him right here again tonight, right now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=129.1s)]
*  Mitt, if you'd like to protect the Republican majority, give us any chance of seizing the Republican majority once again, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=134.54s)]
*  getting it away from the Democrats who are facilitating this massive spending spree and a massive inflationary binge. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=140.86s)]
*  Please get on board. Help me win re-election. Help us do that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=149.38s)]
*  You can get your entire family to donate to me through LeaveForSenate.com. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=153.9s)]
*  I'd invite all of your viewers to do the same, because this is a race that's getting closer and closer, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=157.98s)]
*  because Evan McMullen continues to raise millions of dollars from progressive Democratic donors nationwide [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=162.9s)]
*  who are hell-bent on getting rid of me and replacing him with Evan McMullen. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=169.62s)]
*  I don't think, do you think the voters of Utah understand how fervently Evan McMullen's donors hate the values of the state of Utah? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=173.5s)]
*  I mean, for real, not about tax rates, but the way people live, the religious people with families, like they don't, they hate that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=182.46s)]
*  Do you think your voters get that? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't, because look, the local media in Utah is complicit in this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  They want Evan McMullen to win. For that very reason, they're refusing to ask him policy questions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=194.98s)]
*  They allow him simply to engage in ad hominem attacks on me, notwithstanding the fact that the guy claims to be campaigning on this platform of civility, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=200.89999999999998s)]
*  which is laughable, but they never make him answer any actual policy questions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=209.42s)]
*  So, yeah, I think a lot of Utahns are being duped and fooled, and it doesn't help to have the tacit acquiescence, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=214.98s)]
*  the tacit assistance of my Republican colleague for Utah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=221.34s)]
*  It's noteworthy here that 48, all 48 of my other Republican colleagues are on board with me, have supported me, have supported my campaign and have endorsed me. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=224.66s)]
*  It's not too late, Mitt, you can join the party. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=233.78s)]
*  I'd welcome you to do so, because otherwise you'll be stuck with two more years of Chuck Schumer being the leader [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=236.02s)]
*  and two more years of Joe Biden having unfettered rule over the United States Senate without any Republican backstop. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is a guy, Pierre Delecto, who marched with Black Lives Matter, which hates the nuclear family and endorsed riots. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=250.14s)]
*  Like, I think he's gone insane. I think, my view, not yours. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=256.09999999999997s)]
*  But Senator Mike Lee, I appreciate your coming on. It's an amazing story that we were not aware of. Thank you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=260.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=265.58s)]
*  And I'm Mike Lee, and I'm here to tell you that you're going to be a leader in a world that's going to change the world and changing your life. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=272.26s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRcggr3vtc&t=279.26s)]
