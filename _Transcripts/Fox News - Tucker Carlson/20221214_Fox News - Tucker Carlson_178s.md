# Marco Rubio unveils legislation to ban TikTok in the US
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw)
*  So TikTok turns out to be by far, didn't know this actually, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=0.0s)]
*  the most popular social media app in the United States. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=3.36s)]
*  But the problem is it's owned by a Chinese company [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=6.32s)]
*  controlled by the Chinese government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=9.84s)]
*  And it is for that reason a major security risk. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=12.32s)]
*  Not only does it disseminate propaganda, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  it hurts the country, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=16.96s)]
*  it also apparently is used for spying. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=17.92s)]
*  So the governments of a couple of states [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=20.72s)]
*  have already moved to block TikTok and government devices. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Now a US Senator from Florida, Senator Marco Rubio, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=25.36s)]
*  has introduced legislation to ban TikTok. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=28.24s)]
*  Senator Rubio joins us tonight. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=31.04s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  So Republicans, conservatives are generally [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=35.28s)]
*  against banning private companies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=37.76s)]
*  Tell us why we should ban TikTok, if you would. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=40.48s)]
*  Well, what we ban is their ability to make money in the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=42.96s)]
*  And the reason is because it's basically [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=45.44s)]
*  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Communist Party of China. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  One thing, it's not about the content ultimately. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=50.72s)]
*  I mean, we have free speech in this country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=53.2s)]
*  It's about how the data that's on it is being used. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=54.72s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=56.72s)]
*  Some people would say to me, well, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=57.52s)]
*  what do we care if the Chinese government has access [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  to the data on the phone of a 16-year-old teenager [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=61.2s)]
*  somewhere in America? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  It's not about the 16-year-old teenager. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=65.68s)]
*  It's about millions of 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=67.2s)]
*  30-year-olds, people that are on there, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=70.0s)]
*  dumping all kinds of data that the government of China [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=71.76s)]
*  gets access to on location, your pictures, your text, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=74.0s)]
*  to your consumer behavior, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=77.12s)]
*  what the algorithm is learning from you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=78.4s)]
*  And then the other thing is, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=80.16s)]
*  and this is what's really stunning to me, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=81.28s)]
*  the Chinese tried to interfere in our midterm elections. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=83.2s)]
*  They were putting out videos discouraging people, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=85.76s)]
*  and they were using the algorithms to do this, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  discouraging people from voting on a bipartisan basis [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=89.84s)]
*  or nonpartisan basis. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=92.48s)]
*  And that's why I tell people, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=94.4s)]
*  if TikTok was a Russian company, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=95.28s)]
*  there would be an FBI raid at their headquarters. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=97.44s)]
*  At least they would be calling for it on the left. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=100.0s)]
*  So I think everyone agrees there are privacy danger [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=101.92s)]
*  to America, to our national security. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't have the Communist Party of China [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=105.76s)]
*  having access to a treasure trove of American data [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=107.68s)]
*  that they can use to try to influence and divide us [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=110.4s)]
*  at the same time as they collect valuable information [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=113.2s)]
*  now and for the future. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=115.36s)]
*  Well, yeah, we banned RT. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=116.96s)]
*  I'm hoping that you're going to get [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=119.52s)]
*  at least one Democrat on your side on this, are you? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=120.72s)]
*  I think we will. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=124.24s)]
*  Look, I think we have a lot of Democrat support [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  for the concern about it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=127.28s)]
*  Mark Warner is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=128.72s)]
*  Him and I sent a letter together [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=130.64s)]
*  asking the Justice Department [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=132.24s)]
*  and the intelligence agencies to speed up this review. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=134.16s)]
*  But I don't think anything's going to come of it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=136.56s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=138.24s)]
*  I don't think at the end of the day [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=138.88s)]
*  that anything's going to come of the security review [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  or that anything they do will take care of this problem. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  I think we have to begin with a very basic principle. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=144.96s)]
*  Companies under the control of the Chinese Communist Party [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=148.0s)]
*  should not have access, unfettered access, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  to the private data of millions and millions of Americans [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  that they can then use against us [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=155.68s)]
*  for espionage, for foreign policy, for division. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for saying that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=160.72s)]
*  And so crisply and nicely put. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=161.84s)]
*  I hope you'll keep saying it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=163.36s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio-Florro, good to see you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=164.08s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMEH_2ojJaw&t=165.92000000000002s)]
