# Michael Shellenberger tells Tucker we're seeing the 'decimation' of law enforcement
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs)
*  Michael Schellenberger is one of the best journalists in this country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=0.0s)]
*  His work is on Substack. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=2.72s)]
*  He just wrote a piece on exactly this today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=4.28s)]
*  He joins us tonight with his perceptions. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=6.36s)]
*  Mike, what do you make of what are we watching here exactly? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=9.08s)]
*  And what does it mean? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=12.44s)]
*  We're going to be with you, Tucker. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=15.32s)]
*  And of course, anybody who saw the video of the young man in Memphis, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=16.28s)]
*  Tennessee being beaten by the police is horrified by it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=21.56s)]
*  But I think you're absolutely right. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=24.48s)]
*  The anti-police movement has blood on its hands. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=25.84s)]
*  At least 3000 additional black homicides have occurred since the George Floyd [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  protests of 2020, the George and also the George Floyd riots. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  We've seen about 30 unarmed African Americans killed in 2022, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=37.56s)]
*  60 police officers, but over eight thousand African Americans [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=41.68s)]
*  likely were killed in 2022. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=46.0s)]
*  And this is due to this obviously this anti-policing movement. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=48.08s)]
*  It's led to people, the police leaving the force in droves, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  the demoralization of the police, the pulling back of the police. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  So this is really quite insidious, quite dangerous situation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=59.92s)]
*  And I think that, you know, as we look at these protests going forward, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  you have to distinguish between people who are expressing genuine demands [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  for police reform from the anti-police movement, which has turned into one of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=69.76s)]
*  the most counterproductive and violent movements in American history. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=73.84s)]
*  Unless its real goal is not what they say it is, unless its real goal is to federalize [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  local police and control every organization in the country with guns. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=81.68s)]
*  I mean, do you think that's possible? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=85.72s)]
*  I mean, what we're seeing right now is the decimation of police forces. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=89.48s)]
*  Police departments are up and down all across the country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=92.68s)]
*  Three to five hundred police officers short. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=96.2s)]
*  That's why I mean, it's interesting. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  The protests you just covered in Memphis displaying that there's not enough [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=100.04s)]
*  police officers and the result is that the people that they said they wanted to save [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=103.72s)]
*  African Americans have disproportionately suffered. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=107.92s)]
*  So at least 3000 additional black homicide since the George Floyd protests, again, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=110.64s)]
*  against 30 unarmed black deaths last year. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=114.96s)]
*  It doesn't even compare. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=118.16s)]
*  No, it really doesn't. And thank you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=119.72s)]
*  You always have the numbers. We appreciate it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Michael Schellenberger. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPP1tdQhrs&t=122.63999999999999s)]
