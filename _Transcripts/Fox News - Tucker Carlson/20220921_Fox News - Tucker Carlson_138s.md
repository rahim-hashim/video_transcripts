# Harmeet Dhillon blasts New York attorney general for 'small potatoes' Trump family investigation
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M)
*  Harmeet Dhillon is the chairwoman of the Republican National Lawyers Association and of course a famous lawyer herself [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=0.0s)]
*  She joins us today Harmeet. Thanks so much for coming on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=5.18s)]
*  So I notice I'm not a lawyer, but I noticed they didn't charge him with a crime if it was a crime [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=7.66s)]
*  Why isn't he being charged with a crime? I'm confused as to what this is [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=12.9s)]
*  Well, look as you mentioned Letitia James came into office bragging about how she was going to get Trump [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=17.52s)]
*  She seems to be obsessed with him and you know denies the legitimacy of his election [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  And then it took her three years to get to this point and some would say that because she's trailing in the polls [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=27.06s)]
*  In her race for attorney general. This is time to help boost her [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=31.54s)]
*  Ratings and that's really what this is about. So you're correct Tucker [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=36.26s)]
*  She could not find any crime that she could indict president Trump for she has referred this matter to the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=40.18s)]
*  Southern District of New York in case they can find something [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=46.04s)]
*  But let's look at what she did file on in in New York State fraud has a six-year statute of limitations [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=48.34s)]
*  So they're really basically focusing on things that happen before Donald Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=54.62s)]
*  Became president and his family members got involved in the government like Ivanka Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=58.86s)]
*  so they're really looking at very stale old stuff that nobody bothered about until this time and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=62.9s)]
*  What we're really talking about is differences of opinion about valuation of assets that were heavily negotiated with banks [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=70.5s)]
*  And so Letitia James's complaint 220 pages worth [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=76.9s)]
*  Belies a shocking naivete about the realities of business about the realities of how properties are financed about [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  How businesses operate and it's really like you said very small potato stuff [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=87.84s)]
*  And if it were done by anybody else, it wouldn't be the subject of a complaint like this [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=92.86s)]
*  and so this is entirely political Tucker and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=97.48s)]
*  It is not how a attorney general the United States should be using their awesome political power [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=100.28s)]
*  So if there was a victim of this fraud it would be the banks [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=105.72s)]
*  But my understanding is the banks didn't complain about this. Did I get that right? There are no victims there [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  This is a victimless [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  Complaint nobody is complaining and the banks all got their money back. Everybody is happy except for Letitia James [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  Meet Dylan. Thanks so much for coming on tonight [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=123.36s)]
*  Appreciate my pleasure [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrCaurSz6M&t=126.08s)]
