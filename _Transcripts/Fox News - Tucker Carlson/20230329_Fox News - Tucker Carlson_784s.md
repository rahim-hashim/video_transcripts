# Tucker Carlson: No sane person wants this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we're having a lot of gun control debates this week. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=3.0s)]
*  And it's possible you've heard an advocate for gun control say that in this country we [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=6.44s)]
*  have more firearms in civilian hands than we have civilian hands. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=9.96s)]
*  And that is true, actually. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  The total American population is about 332 million people and collectively they own more [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=16.68s)]
*  than 400 million firearms. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=22.5s)]
*  About half of all U.S. households have at least one gun at home and many have much more [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=25.34s)]
*  than that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=30.08s)]
*  Plus they have ammo. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=31.08s)]
*  Billions and billions of rounds of it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=32.66s)]
*  Those are all real numbers but they are hardly an argument for gun control. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=35.08s)]
*  They're an argument in fact against it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=38.46s)]
*  Ask yourself what would it require to confiscate all those guns and all that ammunition and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=40.7s)]
*  turn the United States into a disarmed nation like Turkmenistan or North Korea? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=46.42s)]
*  Well, it would take a police state and it would end in civil war. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=50.54s)]
*  No sane person wants either one of those things. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=55.26s)]
*  But thankfully we don't need them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  The fact that so many Americans have a firearm within reach but never commit violence tells [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=60.42s)]
*  you that guns are not the problem. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=65.32s)]
*  Most people in this country can be trusted with an AR-15. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=67.82s)]
*  Just as we can be trusted with cars and light aircraft and electricity and baseball bats [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=71.16s)]
*  and insecticide and chainsaws and pruning shears and countless other objects that could [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=75.82s)]
*  easily double as weapons. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=80.84s)]
*  On some level all of us understand this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=83.08s)]
*  The problem is always the person, not the tool he uses to commit a crime. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=85.34s)]
*  If you wanted to stop murder you would focus on the people who are committing murder, not [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=90.98s)]
*  on the hundreds of millions of their neighbors who are not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=94.82s)]
*  You'd really want to know what motivated killers to kill. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=98.38s)]
*  And the first thing you would do is study what murders have in common with one another. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  How they were raised and where, their educational backgrounds, their genetic makeup, drug and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  alcohol use, their ideological and religious views, their sexual behavior and probably [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=110.68s)]
*  a whole lot of other factors. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=115.86000000000001s)]
*  You would study murderers and you would do it with an open mind as a scientist would. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=117.76s)]
*  You would be serious about it because it matters. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=122.18s)]
*  In the late 19th century researchers finally decided that infection is spread by germs [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  and as a result of that conclusion surgeons are now required to wash their hands before [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=129.82s)]
*  they cut you open. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=134.06s)]
*  Everybody agrees that this is progress. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=136.10000000000002s)]
*  But what if we had refused to learn how infection is spread? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=138.76s)]
*  What if we just didn't want to know? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=141.89999999999998s)]
*  Well appendectomies would still be fatal and we would be a backward, ridiculous, uncaring [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=144.45999999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=149.1s)]
*  It's impossible even to imagine that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  And yet on the question of violent crime, of murder, it's very easy to imagine that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  because it's happening. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  Our leaders are determined not to know why people shoot each other and they don't want [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=159.1s)]
*  us to know either. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=163.16s)]
*  We're adamant that we do not ask questions about motive. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=165.04s)]
*  It seems for example like an awful lot of mass shooters have taken prescription psychiatric [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=169.17999999999998s)]
*  drugs in the days before they opened fire and killed others. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=173.28s)]
*  Have you noticed that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=176.98s)]
*  Maybe you have noticed that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=178.18s)]
*  Good luck saying it in public. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=180.0s)]
*  You'll be shouted down immediately by someone with an advanced degree. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=181.48s)]
*  How dare you criticize Big Pharma? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=184.88s)]
*  What are you a conspiracy nut? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  No, actually you're not. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  You're someone who cares about cause and effect. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=191.32s)]
*  You're a rational person. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=194.32s)]
*  The only conspiracy here is the one designed to prevent you from figuring out why mass [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=196.38s)]
*  shootings keep happening. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=201.42s)]
*  Consider the killings that took place on Monday in Nashville. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=204.16s)]
*  The killer was a 28-year-old female transgenderist who shot her way into a Christian elementary [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=207.4s)]
*  school and murdered three nine-year-olds and three adults. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=212.12s)]
*  Why did she do that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=216.28s)]
*  In a rational country that is the very first question we would ask. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=218.42s)]
*  In our country it's the last question. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=221.88s)]
*  In fact, often it's never asked at all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=224.18s)]
*  On those rare occasions when somebody finally manages to wonder out loud about motive, our [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=227.5s)]
*  leaders immediately start lying, which should tell you a lot. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=232.34s)]
*  Here's the Attorney General of the United States yesterday. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=237.14000000000001s)]
*  I realize that the shooter is dead, but the shooter could have had collaborators. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=240.54000000000002s)]
*  Do you plan on opening a hate crime investigation for the targeting of Christians? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=247.9s)]
*  The FBI and ATF are both on the scene working with the local police. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=255.56s)]
*  As of now, motive hasn't been identified and the police chief said at his last press conference [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=262.94s)]
*  that they don't yet have reached a conclusion with respect to motive. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=268.4s)]
*  We are certainly working full-time with them to try and determine what the motive is. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=272.94s)]
*  And of course, motive is what determines whether it's a hate crime or not. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=277.22s)]
*  So here's what we just learned from Merrick Garland. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=281.82s)]
*  The FBI, the ATF, and the Nashville police are all investigating these shootings. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=284.34s)]
*  Yet more than 24 hours after they took place, none of those professional investigators can [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=290.1s)]
*  even guess as to why the shootings happened. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=295.8s)]
*  Motive hasn't been identified, Garland told us. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=299.18s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=302.62s)]
*  You wonder how that could possibly be. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=303.9s)]
*  Just before she opened fire, the Nashville shooter wrote these words to her best friend [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=306.88000000000005s)]
*  over Instagram, quote, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=311.06s)]
*  One day this will make more sense. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=312.68s)]
*  I've left behind more than enough evidence. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  That evidence includes a written manifesto where the killer spells out exactly why she [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=319.0s)]
*  killed children. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  The FBI, the ATF, the Nashville police, and for that matter Merrick Garland, all have [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=324.88000000000005s)]
*  access to that manifesto. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=329.06s)]
*  And yet somehow the attorney general informs us that a motive has not yet been identified. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, he's lying. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=336.48s)]
*  They all are lying. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=337.92s)]
*  We can't see the manifesto because the transgender lobby, which has far more power than you do, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=339.36s)]
*  has pressured politicians to keep it hidden. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=344.12s)]
*  But we can be certain what it says. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  Monday's victims were murdered because they were Christians. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  Transgenderists hate Christians above all, not because Christians are a physical threat [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=353.56s)]
*  – the third graders were not a physical threat – but because Christians refuse to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=356.36s)]
*  join every other liar in our society and proclaim that transgenderists are gods with [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=361.1s)]
*  the power to change nature itself. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=366.22s)]
*  Christians are not allowed to say that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  They have their own god. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  And for that refusal, that unwillingness to bow down and worship a false idol, in this [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=371.88s)]
*  case of transgenderism, they were murdered. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  We have never seen this battle so starkly set as it is now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=379.74s)]
*  And it opens to us, to our eyes, the main divide in America. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=385.1s)]
*  And it's not between race or political party. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=388.9s)]
*  It's not even between religious affiliation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=391.46s)]
*  The divide is between people who think they are god and those who know they are not god. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=394.28s)]
*  That is what the Nashville shooting was about. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=399.76s)]
*  It's what virtually everything is about. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=401.14s)]
*  That conflict exists because these two groups could not be more different. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  They will be forever at odds with one another, and they always have been. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=408.64s)]
*  People who know they are not god are, by definition, restrained. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=413.34s)]
*  They understand the limits of their own power and of their virtue. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=416.58s)]
*  They appreciate the complexity of the world, which they freely admit they don't really [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=419.82s)]
*  understand because no human can fully understand it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=423.18s)]
*  They may not always be good people, but they are certainly less dangerous people if only [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=427.78s)]
*  because their ambitions are limited by the acknowledgement of reality. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  Only God can do certain things and they know they are not him. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=435.14s)]
*  Now people who think they are god are not like this at all. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=439.62s)]
*  People who believe they are god have no natural limits because God has no limits. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=442.94s)]
*  Nor do they have any real concern for others. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=447.38s)]
*  They are their own god. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=449.38s)]
*  They worship themselves. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=450.68s)]
*  In Freudian terms, they are narcissists, and narcissists admit no fault. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=453.18s)]
*  They externalize everything. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=458.04s)]
*  They always blame others. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=459.9s)]
*  So not surprisingly, given this, transgenderists and their allies spent today attacking Christians [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=462.82s)]
*  just days after transgenderists murdered Christian children. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=468.62s)]
*  Here's Congresswoman Catherine Clark of Massachusetts on the House floor. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=473.02s)]
*  Layered in my pride is my concern for you. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=477.22s)]
*  I know your strength, but I also know how determined the forces are that have pitted [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=481.5s)]
*  themselves against you. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=488.3s)]
*  The politicians and preachers who would rather see you languish in a dark closet than watch [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=490.94s)]
*  you engage the world as you do, cultivating joy and love wherever you go. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=497.34s)]
*  Let's reject the forces of opposition and bigotry. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=506.34s)]
*  Let's celebrate the bravery and beauty of our trans community. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=511.53999999999996s)]
*  Cultivating joy and love wherever you go. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=518.54s)]
*  This in response to the murder of children by a self-described trans person. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=521.14s)]
*  You're the victim, transgenderists, not the dead children in Nashville. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=527.38s)]
*  And of course, virtually everyone in power in this country agreed. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=531.98s)]
*  Amazon, the company, sent an email to its employees from its LGBTQ plus department assuring [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=534.9399999999999s)]
*  its trans employees that they were affirmed and they were great people. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  No mention whatsoever of the dead children in Nashville. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=544.6999999999999s)]
*  Their concern was the only concern. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=550.06s)]
*  And then NBC News ran this headline, one of many like it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=551.78s)]
*  Tennessee's trans community's concerned because of the focus on the identity of the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=554.9399999999999s)]
*  shooter. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=559.42s)]
*  No update from NBC on how the Christian community in Nashville is doing because who cares? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=560.5s)]
*  They're just mortals. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=565.8199999999999s)]
*  Their concerns aren't meaningful. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=566.9799999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden certainly doesn't care. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=569.18s)]
*  Watch him chuckle as he talks about Monday's massacre. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=570.8599999999999s)]
*  You believe that Christians were targeted in Nashville school cheating? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=573.86s)]
*  You believe that Christians were targeted? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=578.62s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=581.62s)]
*  God probably believes they were. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=583.22s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=584.9s)]
*  Well, I probably don't bet. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=585.9s)]
*  Probably don't bet. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=587.9s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=588.9s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=589.9s)]
*  People who believe they're God will always turn their rage and frustration outward. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=593.5s)]
*  They will never blame themselves. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=598.66s)]
*  How could they? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=600.46s)]
*  They are God. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=601.46s)]
*  So you should not be surprised to learn that in the wake of this shooting, when their agenda [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=603.0600000000001s)]
*  is revealed for all to see, there will be no contrition, no changing of ways. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=607.46s)]
*  There will only be acceleration and there will be more violence coming. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=611.74s)]
*  And they're telling us that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=615.58s)]
*  The press secretary for the governor of Arizona, Katie Hobbs, someone called Jocelyn Berry, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=617.14s)]
*  who has just resigned apparently, uploaded this photograph hours after the killing along [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=621.26s)]
*  with the message, us when we see transphobes. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  A woman with a gun in her hand, hours after a woman with a gun in her hand killed Christian [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=630.74s)]
*  children in Nashville. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=635.58s)]
*  In other words, the Christians had it coming. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=636.58s)]
*  Don't affirm our delusions. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=640.7s)]
*  We will murder you. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=642.3s)]
*  Again, this is someone who works for the moderate governor of Arizona who beat the radical Carrie [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=643.9s)]
*  Lake. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=650.54s)]
*  And once again, this will continue and it will gather speed because the more they are [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=652.5s)]
*  revealed, the more they double down. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=657.1s)]
*  They can never admit they are wrong because they believe they are gods with the power [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=659.18s)]
*  to control nature. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=664.14s)]
*  So once again, you should not be surprised at all that there is something called the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=665.76s)]
*  Trans Day of Vengeance coming this weekend, planned by Antifa in Washington, D.C. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=669.2199999999999s)]
*  It was originally called the Trans Day of Visibility, but the Trans Radical Activist [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=674.62s)]
*  Network, the organizers, decided to change the name just before the massacre in Nashville. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=679.5s)]
*  Now it's a Trans Day of Vengeance. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=684.06s)]
*  And they mean vengeance. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=687.02s)]
*  For what? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=688.6600000000001s)]
*  That's not clear. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=689.6600000000001s)]
*  They've been caught and so they become more aggressive, as people who worship themselves [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=690.6600000000001s)]
*  always do. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=695.86s)]
*  And you can see it all over social media, threatening images everywhere. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=696.86s)]
*  One trans activist posted this message yesterday, quote, kill Christ cucks, behead Christ cucks, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=699.76s)]
*  roundhouse kick a Christ cuck into the concrete, slam dunk a Christ cuck baby into the trash [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=705.7s)]
*  can. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=710.3000000000001s)]
*  Attached to this post is an image of someone holding a rifle and wearing body armor. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=711.3000000000001s)]
*  Now you would think in a country supposedly as sensitive to violence as ours, run by an [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=716.38s)]
*  administration that wants to end gun violence, that the Justice Department would be all over [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=720.58s)]
*  this, because they're terrified, of course, of groups with guns who are organized trying [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=724.9399999999999s)]
*  to upset the social order. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=730.58s)]
*  But in this case, they're not terrified at all. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=731.82s)]
*  They have no problem with this whatsoever. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=733.9s)]
*  We called the DOJ today to ask, what are you doing about this? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=735.98s)]
*  They didn't bother to get back to us. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=738.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, the tech barons are, as always, making sure you don't even know what's happening. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=740.66s)]
*  Twitter, which was supposed to be free, has banned several users, including a sitting [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=745.74s)]
*  member of Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Andy Ngo, Sean Davis, for mentioning the existence [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=750.3s)]
*  of the Trans Day of Vengeance. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=756.38s)]
*  You're not supposed to know what's coming. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=758.54s)]
*  The head of trust at Twitter, a woman called Ella Irwin, is deliberately silencing reporting [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=760.5s)]
*  on this Day of Vengeance. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=766.52s)]
*  Because again, it's coming. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=768.62s)]
*  But you shouldn't be allowed to prepare for it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=771.42s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlMEaFzpek&t=773.66s)]
