# Tucker: Inflation is proof the people in charge are reckless and stupid
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, believe it or not, in 1980, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=3.84s)]
*  which wasn't that long ago, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=5.54s)]
*  Venezuela was the richest country in Latin America. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=7.08s)]
*  It had the highest wages, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=10.72s)]
*  it had the best healthcare and education. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=11.76s)]
*  It also had, by the standards of the region anyway, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=14.0s)]
*  a famously stable democracy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=16.16s)]
*  Then came an energy crisis, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=18.96s)]
*  and Venezuela wound up with inflation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=20.68s)]
*  At times it reached 100% a year. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=22.62s)]
*  Inflation makes people poor, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=25.12s)]
*  so in a very short time, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=26.8s)]
*  and the poverty rate in Venezuela doubled. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=27.84s)]
*  By 1995, 66% of all Venezuelans were impoverished. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=30.4s)]
*  Getting poor tends to make voters radical, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=36.56s)]
*  so inevitably Venezuela got radical politics. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=38.64s)]
*  You know what happened next. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Venezuela is now rated one of the most miserable places [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=43.68s)]
*  on planet Earth. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=46.44s)]
*  A few years ago, citizens in Caracas [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=48.16s)]
*  were reduced to eating zoo animals. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=50.36s)]
*  There was no food, and for that matter, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  there was no electricity. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=53.28s)]
*  So in just half a lifetime, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=54.8s)]
*  an advanced society had reverted to the Stone Age. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=56.76s)]
*  The United States is not in danger [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=60.36s)]
*  of becoming Venezuela next week, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=61.64s)]
*  but we are moving closer to it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=63.28s)]
*  Inflation is a big part of the reason. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=65.25999999999999s)]
*  Of all the economic crises a country can face, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=67.78s)]
*  inflation is the most dangerous. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=70.5s)]
*  Inflation doesn't just make people poor, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=72.5s)]
*  it totally destroys their confidence in their leaders, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=74.52s)]
*  the authorities who issued the now worthless currency [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=77.2s)]
*  they're using for toilet paper. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=79.3s)]
*  Inflation is not an act of God, like a drought or hurricane, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=81.14s)]
*  it's an act of negligence, like drunk driving. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=84.44s)]
*  It is proof that the people in charge [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  are reckless and stupid. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=88.84s)]
*  That's why inflation tends to topple governments. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=90.52s)]
*  Once you get inflation, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=93.14s)]
*  there is no pretending you've done a good job. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  You have not done a good job, and everybody knows it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  So you can see why the Biden administration [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=99.0s)]
*  is very worried about this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=101.0s)]
*  Joe Biden has historically low approval ratings. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=102.5s)]
*  Voters say inflation is their top concern. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=104.72s)]
*  Those two facts are directly related. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=107.44s)]
*  So Biden's most pressing task right now [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=109.8s)]
*  is reassuring Americans [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  that he understands their suffering under inflation [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=113.08s)]
*  and under a rapidly worsening economy, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=116.28s)]
*  and that he's got a plan to fix it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=118.28s)]
*  If he can't convince Americans of that, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=120.2s)]
*  it may be a long time [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=122.56s)]
*  before we have another Democratic president. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=123.56s)]
*  Thankfully, Joe Biden has a plan, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=125.98s)]
*  or at least a new publicist, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=127.82s)]
*  a silver-tongued wordsmith slash policy guru [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=129.12s)]
*  called Corrine Jean-Pierre. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=132.12s)]
*  It is Corrine Jean-Pierre's job [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=134.6s)]
*  to take this message of economic hope [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=136.44s)]
*  to the American people and save the Biden administration. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=138.52s)]
*  She started Monday. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=142.46s)]
*  Here were her first words from the podium. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  I am obviously acutely aware [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=147.08s)]
*  that my presence at this podium represents a few firsts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=149.86s)]
*  I am a black, gay, immigrant woman, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=154.72s)]
*  the first of all three of those to hold this position. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=157.26000000000002s)]
*  So that was a little confusing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=162.34s)]
*  It wasn't actually about America, it was about her. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=163.58s)]
*  But still, we learned that Corrine Jean-Pierre [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=165.18s)]
*  is a black lesbian, the first ever in history, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=168.02s)]
*  which she reminded us to hold this particular job. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=170.46s)]
*  Listen carefully. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  That shattering you here in the background? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=175.18s)]
*  It's a thousand glass ceilings cracking simultaneously [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=177.66s)]
*  into millions of tiny pieces [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  and then being swept by the custodians of tomorrow [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=183.72s)]
*  into the trash bin of bigotry and hate. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=185.94s)]
*  Soon they'll be trucked to a landfill and buried. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=188.62s)]
*  It's a new day, America. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=190.74s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=193.46s)]
*  You still can't afford to have your refrigerator fixed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=194.88s)]
*  or go to the dentist. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=196.84s)]
*  On the other hand, Corrine Jean-Pierre [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=198.14s)]
*  has good news for you about herself. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=200.54s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre has just reached [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=202.98s)]
*  a highly significant personal goal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=204.61999999999998s)]
*  And understandably, she is brimming with self-esteem. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  Congratulations, Corrine Jean-Pierre. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  Your promotion is America's promotion. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  Hope it feels good. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=215.61999999999998s)]
*  You're gonna wanna hold on to that sensation [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=216.73999999999998s)]
*  when you're now experiencing and treasure it [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  in the days ahead like a hand warmer [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=221.5s)]
*  as America becomes poorer than you ever imagined possible. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=223.94s)]
*  And it is. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=226.89999999999998s)]
*  As of tonight, parents across the country [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=228.98s)]
*  can't find baby formula. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=230.7s)]
*  Oh, no big deal. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=231.82s)]
*  Well, it is actually a big deal [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=233.3s)]
*  because as a result of that, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=234.34s)]
*  several children have just been hospitalized [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=235.54s)]
*  in the state of Tennessee. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=237.54s)]
*  Fertilizer prices, meanwhile, have hit record highs. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=239.34s)]
*  That will mean food shortages around the world, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=241.94s)]
*  famine in some places, starvation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=244.38s)]
*  It'll mean shortages here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=246.46s)]
*  Food inflation, Bloomberg reports, will quote, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=248.34s)]
*  leave no household unscathed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=250.74s)]
*  And then gas prices also just hit an all-time high. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=253.3s)]
*  They're not going down. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=255.7s)]
*  A CEO at a major refiner says gas prices will stay high [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  for the foreseeable future. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=260.14s)]
*  Quote, I don't see any signs of it ending soon or well. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=261.54s)]
*  And that's true of inflation [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  across every major sector of this economy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=267.58s)]
*  Axios reporting tonight that quote, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  inflation is pushing prices higher and higher [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=271.62s)]
*  and some of those costs may never come back down [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  to the levels Americans were accustomed to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=276.74s)]
*  before the pandemic. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=279.18s)]
*  More than half the CEOs in this country publicly predict [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=281.14s)]
*  that recession is imminent. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=284.38s)]
*  That's what they're saying in public. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=285.66s)]
*  Imagine what they're saying in private. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=286.78s)]
*  Morgan Stanley says there's a 27% chance [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=288.73999999999995s)]
*  we get a recession in the next 12 months. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  That's up from 5% just two months ago. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=293.26s)]

*  given that nearly half of new electricity generation capacity [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=379.02000000000004s)]

*  minding my own business, thinking this could happen [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=656.42s)]
*  at any time. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=659.14s)]

*  and kill him with the First Amendment. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=662.7s)]
*  That's what happens when you walk your dog in this country. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=665.1s)]
*  That's how bad it is. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=667.62s)]

*  may be the single biggest problem America faces right now. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=670.98s)]
*  In fact, it is. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=673.58s)]
*  The problem is definitely not that we're running out [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=675.5s)]
*  of energy to power civilization. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  That's not a big deal at all. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=678.54s)]
*  And that's why you probably didn't read about the fact [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=679.66s)]
*  that the Interior Department just announced [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=682.06s)]

*  Buy it from Venezuela. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=691.7800000000001s)]
*  Yes, we can. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=693.38s)]
*  20 minutes ago they told you Venezuela was a criminal regime. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=694.82s)]

*  but Venezuela can. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=703.34s)]
*  And the United States, the Biden administration [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=705.1s)]
*  is doing everything it can to allow the United States [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=706.58s)]
*  to buy Venezuelan oil directly. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=709.2600000000001s)]
*  What does that add up to? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=712.5s)]
*  Don't think about that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=714.38s)]
*  Thinking about it is racist. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=715.86s)]
*  It's like the First Amendment, it's white supremacy. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=717.66s)]
*  And if you don't believe it, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=719.66s)]

*  Donald Trump is running a racist campaign. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=725.18s)]
*  The grand wizard of the birther movement, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=728.3399999999999s)]

*  By the way, he's a racist and a bigot, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=733.06s)]
*  which we already knew. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=734.5799999999999s)]

*  who really pushes his racism like a peacock. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=748.98s)]
*  Because I'll say this, we knew Donald Trump was a racist. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=752.6600000000001s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, just change the topic [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=755.86s)]

*  that we have seen in generations. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=771.38s)]
*  This country needs to start talking [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=773.42s)]
*  about uprooting institutional racism. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=776.38s)]
*  Fox News was racist before coronavirus. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=779.38s)]
*  They are racist during the coronavirus. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=782.1s)]

*  You shut up, I talk. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=794.62s)]
*  We need to have a conversation about how racist you are, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=796.66s)]
*  which is very racist. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=798.3399999999999s)]
*  So if you can't keep the lights on or go to the dentist, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyfGIpqulA&t=799.74s)]
