# Hornswoggle calls out Peter Dinklage
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w)
*  So Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage went on a podcast the other day and declared that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=0.0s)]
*  it was quote offensive and backward that Disney was planning to hire real life dwarves, little [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=6.68s)]
*  people for remake of the film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=13.24s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=16.28s)]
*  I was a little taken back by the very very they're very proud to cast a Latino actress [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=17.28s)]
*  as Snow White. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=25.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=27.04s)]
*  But you're still telling the story of Snow White. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=28.04s)]
*  Seven Dwarfs. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Take a step back and look at what you're doing there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=32.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=34.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=35.8s)]
*  It makes no sense to me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=36.8s)]
*  Well, so what would you be? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=37.8s)]
*  You're progressive in one way and then but you're still making that backward. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=39.0s)]
*  Oh story of seven dwarves living in a cave. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=43.48s)]
*  What the you doing man? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=47.76s)]
*  So in response to that podcast, podcasts of real power now, the Disney company said it [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  was quote rethinking its use of dwarves in the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs remake. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=56.08s)]
*  Now some dwarf actors are asking who put Peter Dinklage in charge of the dwarf community? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=61.92s)]
*  Dylan Postle played Hornswoggle the leprechaun in the WWE for 10 years. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=67.32s)]
*  He also acted the Muppets. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=71.48s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=72.92s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=75.08s)]
*  So you so I think a lot of people hear this podcast and they think, well, you know, here's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=76.12s)]
*  a guy who's got the authority to speak on this and that's his view and no one kind of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=80.96s)]
*  questions it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=85.6s)]
*  Tell us what your reaction to it was. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=86.6s)]
*  My biggest thing is is he wants to be progressive and it's all about progression and I support [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  that completely. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=95.92s)]
*  But the issue is him being progressive is eliminating seven potential dream jobs from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=96.92s)]
*  the dwarf acting community. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  And that's that's my issue here is he's saying he wants to move forward and do good for the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  community when this these are dream jobs. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=112.08s)]
*  I got hired by WWE. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=115.2s)]
*  WWE was my dream job since I was four years old. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=117.56s)]
*  So I was four years old. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=120.28s)]
*  All I wanted to be was a WWE superstar. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=121.52s)]
*  And in any other circumstance, it wouldn't have been able to be done by me. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=124.16s)]
*  I'm not six foot. I'm not 250 pounds. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=129.68s)]
*  But they were looking for a person like me, a little person to fill this role. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=131.84s)]
*  They hired me and I got to live my dream for 10 years. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=136.6s)]
*  Now there's dwarf actors out there that their dream is their dream is to to to to star in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=140.32s)]
*  a film, especially a Disney film, because as we know, Disney doesn't do remakes or any [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  of their movies at a small scale. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=152.44s)]
*  They they were going to blow this movie up, obviously. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=153.88s)]
*  And these are seven roles that are few and far between for dwarves anyways that were [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=157.6s)]
*  made for us. And that's that's the what's ridiculous to me about the whole situation [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=164.2s)]
*  is it's not being progressive. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=168.84s)]
*  You're hurting the community by what you're doing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=171.32s)]
*  You make a really good point. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  And the film is called Seven Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=175.88s)]
*  So, I mean, if there was ever a place, it might be. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=179.72s)]
*  All right. It's not Snow White and the seven normal size humans. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  I get that we have to be progressive. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=186.2s)]
*  We have to move forward. But you're changing one of the most known fairy tales and one [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=188.44s)]
*  of the most known Disney adaptations of all time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  Why? And also, I hate to say it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=197.48s)]
*  And the King Dwarf thing, I said, and I mean that who put this guy in charge and why is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  he the single voice like for a whole community, for a whole community of people? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=207.6s)]
*  I can argue I was on TV for 10 years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  I was in film, not at the scale he was. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=216.92s)]
*  But why? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=220.04s)]
*  Why? Because he throws the red flag is everything stopped. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  And that's just what upsets me is. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=225.92s)]
*  So one guy has an opinion on a on a podcast and he gets to take control of your career [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  going forward. That's a little strange. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=234.48s)]
*  So have you met with I mean, I think you make a very fair point. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=235.68s)]
*  Have you met with Disney? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=238.68s)]
*  I have not. And I would absolutely love to. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=241.24s)]
*  And I would absolutely love to give my opinion as well as I've had people from the dwarf [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  community reach out to me saying how this is crazy that that to recast or to to make [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=246.64s)]
*  it normal humans or normal sides. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=252.8s)]
*  I use that term, but normal humans and normal sized humans for these roles. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  It's just it's it's insane to me. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=262.48s)]
*  And it's just it just doesn't make any sense. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  I say it all the time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  Disney, I know six dwarf actors with myself that would love these roles. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=268.68s)]
*  I'll play sleepy or grumpy or whoever, or I'll be a stunt double for one of them for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=274.32s)]
*  all I care. I these are dream roles. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=279.6s)]
*  Literally made for our community. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=282.76s)]
*  And I just think it's it's crazy to to recast it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=285.48s)]
*  You make such a good point. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=289.4s)]
*  It's a metaphor. A small number of unhappy people get to wreck it for everyone. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  Dylan, I hope you get exactly the role that you want and I hope you reach Disney. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=294.08s)]
*  Thank you for coming on tonight. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTDt9cV16w&t=297.36s)]
