# Mom mowed down by L.A. hit-and-run driver livid over suspect's light sentence
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ)
*  We showed you a tape last night that was so awful that we hesitated before putting it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=7.28s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=8.28s)]
*  A hit and driver in Los Angeles last August. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=9.28s)]
*  A 16 year old stole a car and intentionally ran over a woman who was pushing her 8 month [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=11.68s)]
*  old son in a stroller. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=17.62s)]
*  We're going to show you again, it's disturbing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=19.12s)]
*  Before we put it on the screen though, we should tell you that the mother and child [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=21.6s)]
*  Well, but it's still awful to see. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=27.48s)]
*  And you should also, the LA-backed, the LA, Soros-backed district attorney, George Gascon, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=30.36s)]
*  has announced the guy who did this will receive a sentence of only 5 months in a quote, diversionary [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=34.44s)]
*  program. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Now, the mother who was injured in that attack is of course outraged, obviously. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  What does it say about the value of her life? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=44.88s)]
*  She was requested to refer to it only by her first name, Rachel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=47.04s)]
*  We're honored to have her join us now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Rachel, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=51.88s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Tucker. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=53.56s)]
*  So that tape is really, we actually debated whether to put it on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  It's that awful, I can't even imagine how you feel when you, well how do you feel when [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=59.04s)]
*  you see that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=63.44s)]
*  You know, at this point I'm pretty numb to it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=64.44s)]
*  I watched it about, you know, I'd say at least a thousand times. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=66.44s)]
*  I've still shot at it to see, you know, did I do what I thought I did? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=70.88s)]
*  Did I do everything I could to protect my child? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=77.32s)]
*  And thankfully I think I did. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=79.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  It was very tough to watch it first, made me very sick. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  But I'm okay now watching it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=85.04s)]
*  It seems very obvious, and I'm just looking at the screen right now, there's space for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=86.92s)]
*  him to avoid you and your son, but it looks like he did it on purpose. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=91.72s)]
*  Absolutely, he did it on purpose. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=96.56s)]
*  You know, I made eye contact with him as he was approaching us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=99.28s)]
*  I screamed for him to stop. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=102.28s)]
*  You know, there was plenty of room. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=105.68s)]
*  Two cars can fit. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=107.4s)]
*  It's a one-way street, so it's meant for just one car, but you know, there are cars that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  can park on the side of the road, and there's still plenty of room for another car to pass. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  So anyone who would mow down a mother and her baby in a stroller on purpose is someone [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  who should be locked far away from the rest of us, no? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=124.26s)]
*  Absolutely, and I just learned from Bill Mollusian on Sunday that the kid had a felony record [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  already and was out on probation when he hit me. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  So how do you, I mean, this is almost a rhetorical question, how do you feel about what George [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=137.52s)]
*  Gascon has done? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=141.96s)]
*  What message does that send? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  It sends a lot of messages. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=144.68s)]
*  It sends messages to criminals that, you know, it's okay to do bad things because we're not [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=147.52s)]
*  going to punish you, we're going to punish the victims instead. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=152.56s)]
*  You know, I'm just beside myself with the comments that he's come out with on Twitter [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  citing that, you know, California law says that the punishment is fair when in fact it's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  his policies that he put into place that prevent us from getting appropriate justice. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=165.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he assigns no value to your life or your son's life at all, it feels like. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  No, no, I mean, he can take the time to tweet about it and make this a political thing, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=176.36s)]
*  which it's not. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=184.44s)]
*  I'd like to admit I'm a Democrat and I voted for George Gascon. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=185.88000000000002s)]
*  I was raised in a Republican family, so I'm pretty centrist, but I lean left. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, his, I voted for this guy because I believe that, you know, our prisons do need [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=193.56s)]
*  some reform, but rewarding criminals, violent criminals for their actions is very far from [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=199.28s)]
*  any kind of reformation that anybody would think is appropriate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=208.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a failure. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=212.56s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's the most basic duty of government to protect its citizens, particularly [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=214.4s)]
*  moms with babies and strollers. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's not a tough call. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=220.88s)]
*  Especially the courts. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=221.88s)]
*  The courts are here to protect us and he's rewriting the laws essentially in Los Angeles, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=223.24s)]
*  you know, so that people can get away with whatever they feel like. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=228.92s)]
*  Are you going to stay in the state, do you think? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=233.28s)]
*  Not long term, no. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=236.4s)]
*  You know, we have plans to move in the short term, like the very short term we'll stay [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=237.48s)]
*  in the state for a little while, but our long term goal is to leave the state. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=241.88s)]
*  And so the future of the state erodes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=246.76s)]
*  It's so sad. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  You are brave to come on, especially since as you admitted, it's not a political thing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=250.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, every person in Los Angeles should be concerned. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=256.2s)]
*  You know, our crime rates are through the roof and we need all of the support we can [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=260.12s)]
*  get from both sides of the aisle, all the voters. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=264.2s)]
*  It's very nonpartisan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=266.88s)]
*  Amen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=268.32s)]
*  Well, you've done a great service in telling your story. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=269.32s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh_avJlKOMQ&t=271.08s)]
