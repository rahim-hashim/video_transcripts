# The evidence is damning: Rufo
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U)
*  The governor of Florida has signed a bill banning teachers from talking to small children [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=0.0s)]
*  ages kindergarten through third grade about their own genitals or encouraging them to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=4.72s)]
*  change their gender. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=8.58s)]
*  The overwhelming majority, overwhelming majority of Americans including of Democrats agree [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=10.08s)]
*  with that because it's common sense and the alternative is disgusting and probably illegal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  But at the Walt Disney Corporation, they were infuriated by this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Disney called an all-hands meeting to discuss new ways to indoctrinate children without [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=25.04s)]
*  their parents' knowledge. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=30.08s)]
*  Chris Ruffo obtained footage from that meeting. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=31.08s)]
*  Here's the executive producer of Disney Television Animation bragging about quote, injecting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=33.68s)]
*  queerness into as many shows as she can. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=37.8s)]
*  Our leadership over there has been so welcoming to like my like not at all secret gay agenda. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=41.84s)]
*  I don't have to be afraid to like, let's have these two characters kiss. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=48.28s)]
*  Let's in the background. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Like I was just wherever I could just basically adding queerness to like the if you see anything [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=53.64s)]
*  queer the show, but like I just was like no one would stop me and no one was trying to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=59.52s)]
*  stop me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=64.92s)]
*  Okay, so here's Disney's diversity and inclusion manager explained to the company will no [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=65.92s)]
*  longer use the words boys and girls. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=72.4s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  Last summer we removed all of the gendered greetings in relationship to our lives feels. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  So we no longer say ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=83.32s)]
*  We we've trained. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=86.52s)]
*  We provided training for all of our our past members and in relationship to that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=87.52s)]
*  So now they know it's hello everyone or hello friends. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  Degendering your children without telling you Chris Ruffo is a journalist and a filmmaker [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=96.72s)]
*  and quite a reporter. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=102.44s)]
*  He got this footage as he's done many times in the past on related topics. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  We're happy to have him join us tonight. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=107.32s)]
*  Chris, thanks a lot for coming on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=108.56s)]
*  So what exactly was that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  So this was an all hands meeting in response to Governor DeSantis is legislation where [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=113.96s)]
*  Disney had assembled their LGBTQIA activists that they've set up within the company and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  they said that they're deliberately trying to take programming that goes from even ages [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=124.55999999999999s)]
*  two to seven years old and inject queerness into that programming. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=128.72s)]
*  They're trying to really make all of their programs this left wing gender ideology compatible [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=132.88s)]
*  and they're even doing something I think that is at the height of hypocrisy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=139.28s)]
*  At the same time, they're falsely accusing Governor DeSantis of implementing a don't [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=143.0s)]
*  say gay policy, which is not true at all. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=147.28s)]
*  They were systematically and simultaneously telling all of their park employees to eliminate [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  the words ladies, gentlemen, boys and girls. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  They're projecting onto the governor what they themselves are doing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=157.84s)]
*  We've caught them on tape and the evidence is damning. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=161.52s)]
*  So they have a sexual agenda for six year old children. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  So right there you think, well, you know, you would think that's illegal in some way. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=168.16s)]
*  It's certainly immoral. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=172.8s)]
*  It's creepy as hell. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=174.04s)]
*  And yet, you know, they're the country's leading purveyor of children's programming. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=176.08s)]
*  That's a problem, no? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=181.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=183.84s)]
*  And I think what we can really see inside the company is that executives made the decision [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=184.84s)]
*  a few years ago to create these activist organizations within the company first on the issues of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=188.16s)]
*  race and now on the issues of gender and sexual orientation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=193.6s)]
*  These activist organizations essentially have taken moral power from within the company [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=197.2s)]
*  and the executives who are really cowardly and craven individuals just cave any time [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=201.6s)]
*  that they want something. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=206.64s)]
*  And so all of these videos document that whatever these activists say, they're now creating [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=208.12s)]
*  a tracking program for all Disney children's content to find out exactly how many transgender, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=212.84s)]
*  asexual and bisexual characters that they're peppering into the show, either in the foreground [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=219.48s)]
*  or the background. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=224.04s)]
*  It sounds like a really kind of bizarre and creepy gender studies experiment on a college [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=225.4s)]
*  campus, but it's being mainlined into children's programming all over the world. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  What sounds like the behavior of a sex offender. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=235.36s)]
*  I mean, normal people don't sexualize underage children, period. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  They have nothing to do with sex. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=239.96s)]
*  They're little kids. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=241.52s)]
*  They're pretty pubescent, but Disney doesn't feel that way. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=242.52s)]
*  It seems like a threat and I appreciate your exposing it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=244.56s)]
*  Chris Ruffo, thank you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=247.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NdsZNDL_U&t=250.08s)]
