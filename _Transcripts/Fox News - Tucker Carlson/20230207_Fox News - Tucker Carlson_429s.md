# Tucker Carlson: We can't fix this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, imagine you're Joe Biden and you're required to give a State of the Union address [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=2.6s)]
*  because it's in the Constitution. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=6.7s)]
*  So if you're Biden, it would take a lot of brass to stand up on live television and claim [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=9.8s)]
*  the U.S. is better off than it was when you took over. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=13.98s)]
*  Could you do that? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=18.52s)]
*  Well, in a little more than an hour, Joe Biden will do that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=19.52s)]
*  If only it were true. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=23.62s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=25.14s)]
*  This country is more divided, less self-confident, more confused and sadder than it's been in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=26.46s)]
*  living memory. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=32.5s)]
*  For the first time in generations, we face the actual risk of a world war. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=33.78s)]
*  Our problems are fixable, but they are profound and they require the full attention of wise [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=38.18s)]
*  and serious leaders who love the country and who are willing to think beyond the next election. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=43.3s)]
*  Instead, unfortunately, we've got Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the cast of mediocrities [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=47.74s)]
*  who stand behind them making the actual decisions. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=51.58s)]
*  So if we had to guess, we would guess that Biden is going to use his speech tonight as [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=54.78s)]
*  he had another opportunity to brag about his victories and blame his failures on others. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=58.42s)]
*  January 6th, Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=62.86s)]
*  We don't expect a single honest word. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=65.18s)]
*  We hope we're surprised, but we don't expect to be. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=66.78s)]
*  In the meantime, here's as close to we can get as a statistical analysis of the actual [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=70.04s)]
*  State of the Union under Joe Biden. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=75.28s)]
*  Since his predecessor, Donald Trump, gave his final address to the joint session of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=77.66s)]
*  The cost of food staples in the United States, a pretty good measure, has risen by more than [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=81.97999999999999s)]
*  20 percent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=86.61999999999999s)]
*  The price of gasoline has gone up by more than 40 and diesel even higher. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  Consumer confidence, meanwhile, is the mirror image. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=91.61999999999999s)]
*  It's dropped by 40 percent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=94.1s)]
*  What's risen is credit card debt. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=96.74s)]
*  That's now at an all time high, over a trillion dollars cumulatively, it is estimated, and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=98.22s)]
*  homelessness as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=103.3s)]
*  There are now tens of thousands more Americans living on the streets than there were when [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=104.94s)]
*  Joe Biden became president. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  He'll ignore that fact tonight, guaranteed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=111.02000000000001s)]
*  What could he say about it? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=113.34s)]
*  On the other hand, how could he ignore it? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=114.34s)]
*  But again, he will. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=116.14s)]
*  Interest rates, meanwhile, have skyrocketed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=117.9s)]
*  The number of new home buyers is lower than it's been at any point in modern history. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  The number of working age American men who are actually working is now under 68 percent. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=123.18s)]
*  Take a look at the graph on your screen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=128.1s)]
*  If anything is an emergency, that's an emergency. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=130.18s)]
*  But it's being ignored. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  We'll just import new workers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  And that's why the southern border of the United States is open tonight as it has been [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=136.82s)]
*  for two years. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=140.22s)]
*  And because it's open, millions and millions and millions, millions of foreign nationals [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=141.22s)]
*  have streamed across into our country illegally. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=145.94s)]
*  In many cases, we know nothing about them at all. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=148.9s)]
*  We can't even imagine how their presence long term will affect our economy or already strained [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=151.06s)]
*  social services, the ones you paid for your entire life. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=155.9s)]
*  You think healthcare is in shambles now? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=159.32s)]
*  Go ahead and visit an emergency room in five years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=161.14s)]
*  Good luck getting treatment. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=164.64s)]
*  But the real cost to the country is in social cohesion. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=166.86s)]
*  This is just too many new people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=169.62s)]
*  Doesn't matter whether they're good people or bad people, they're strangers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=173.1s)]
*  And they're too many of them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=177.58s)]
*  There is no chance we could assimilate all of them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=178.58s)]
*  And at this point, we have enough problems with our social fabric all on our own. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=182.9s)]
*  Here's one measure. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  In March of 2020, 31 percent of Americans told Gallup that they, quote, worried a great [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=188.34s)]
*  deal about race. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=192.62s)]
*  When Joe Biden took office, that number went up to nearly 50 percent. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=194.78s)]
*  And of course, it's all the administration talks about, race. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=198.34s)]
*  Race is not a solvable condition. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  It's genetic. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=205.26s)]
*  It never changes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=206.5s)]
*  So if you focus on it, ultimately you'll make people hate each other. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=208.22s)]
*  And that's what's happening. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=212.46s)]
*  That might make you anxious about the future. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=215.46s)]
*  But of course, our future is education. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=217.32s)]
*  All of us have heard that since birth in this country. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  So how are our schools doing under Joe Biden? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=221.58s)]
*  Well, here's one measure. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=224.1s)]
*  The national average ACT score in 2022 hit its lowest level in more than three decades. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=226.42s)]
*  ACT scores have gone down too. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=232.26s)]
*  Now just over 40 percent of all test takers, 40 percent meet or exceed standards in reading, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=234.5s)]
*  writing and math. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=240.42s)]
*  Test results in certain cities are even worse. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=242.38s)]
*  In Baltimore, for example, at least 23 schools have not a single student, not one student [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=245.22s)]
*  in the whole school, proficient in math. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=250.3s)]
*  So how is the Biden administration responding to this? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=254.94s)]
*  Are there alarms going off in the education department? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=257.94s)]
*  No. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=260.82s)]
*  Schools are just failing to measure the failure. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=261.98s)]
*  They're getting rid of standardized tests up and down the chain, including Harvard, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=265.02s)]
*  which just made them optional. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=269.18s)]
*  The American Bar Association says law students don't even need to take the LSAT anymore because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=270.74s)]
*  tests are racist. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=275.94s)]
*  So there's a lot of concern, expressed concern about racial justice and equity. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=278.86s)]
*  Has that helped people? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=283.14s)]
*  Well, it's made a few people very rich. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=284.34s)]
*  The ladies who run Black Lives Matter have a lot of houses. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=286.58s)]
*  But how are ordinary people doing? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  Are they better off for all of it? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=290.82s)]
*  No. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=292.97999999999996s)]
*  Life expectancy in the United States has continued to decline for all races, black and white [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  Americans. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=299.38s)]
*  It's now at its lowest level life expectancy in over 25 years. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=300.38s)]
*  Now that's not just due to COVID. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  Those numbers have been declining every year for the past four years. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=307.28s)]
*  Suicides up roughly five percent that we know of. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  Alcoholism up more than 50 percent since before the pandemic. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=313.86s)]
*  Alcohol deaths up more than 30 percent. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=317.42s)]
*  Now these aren't so much medical problems as they are famously deaths of despair. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=319.94s)]
*  And what's jarring is that there doesn't seem to be an option for many Americans. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=326.4s)]
*  A lot of people in this country don't think they can be saved. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=331.14s)]
*  Church membership has just dropped below 50 percent for the first time ever in the history [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=334.3s)]
*  of this country. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=338.54s)]
*  So it's a sad, secular country with decreasing reservoirs of hope. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=340.58000000000004s)]
*  And military enlistment is a pretty good measure of how people feel about that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=346.3s)]
*  The Pentagon has fallen short of its enlistment targets by 25 percent. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  That's more than 15,000 recruits. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=355.62s)]
*  So what's growing and thriving in this country under Joe Biden? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=359.1s)]
*  Well weed dispensaries are. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=362.58000000000004s)]
*  They're popping up everywhere and the Biden administration is encouraging this. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  That's the Biden economy. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=368.5s)]
*  Backed by private equity. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=371.38s)]
*  Cannabis sales have exploded in this country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=373.85999999999996s)]
*  Gone from 12 billion dollars to more than 30 billion dollars a year. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=376.78s)]
*  So we're building back better. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHWCS4to57Q&t=383.74s)]
