# Fauci's test beagles freed from the lab
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA)
*  We promised you good news and we're delivering it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=0.0s)]
*  We told you some months ago about the 4,000 beagles [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=2.46s)]
*  that were slated to be tortured for no real reason [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  at a research facility in Virginia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=8.88s)]
*  Tony Fauci had purchased dogs from that facility. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=12.22s)]
*  Well, a group called the White Coat Waste Project [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=14.96s)]
*  first uncovered the abuse of the beagles [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=17.5s)]
*  and found purchase records that show [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=19.1s)]
*  the abuse of several dogs to be, quote, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=21.12s)]
*  used in septic shock experiments at NIH. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=23.02s)]
*  The dogs were denied food and eaten alive by bugs, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=26.04s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=28.8s)]
*  Not even going into details because it's too depressing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=29.64s)]
*  Now, a major breeding facility [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=31.44s)]
*  for those research facilities has been shut down [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=32.82s)]
*  and the first batch of beagles has been set free. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=35.32s)]
*  Daphna Nakhminovitch is the Senior Vice President of PETA [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  and joins us tonight with an update on this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=41.92s)]
*  Daphna, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=43.92s)]
*  So these beagles are not going to be tortured. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=46.32s)]
*  What's, congratulations, we're celebrating. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=49.540000000000006s)]
*  What happens to them now? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=52.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  We are celebrating, Tucker. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=56.24s)]
*  Thanks for having me back on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=57.16s)]
*  Next, over the next 60 days or so, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=59.0s)]
*  they're going to be transferred [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  to the Humane Society of the United States [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  and from there going to various shelters [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=65.0s)]
*  in Virginia and beyond. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  The first group was released yesterday [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=68.89999999999999s)]
*  to the tune of approximately 400. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=71.1s)]
*  And these are thousands and thousands of dogs [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  that were bred for research. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=75.84s)]
*  The facility has been there since 1961. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=77.12s)]
*  And we are just thrilled that not a single one [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=80.08s)]
*  of these 4,000 beagles will ever be tortured [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  and killed in a lab. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=85.4s)]
*  They will all have the opportunity to find a loving home, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=87.68s)]
*  to feel the grass under their paws, the sun on their back, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  play with a toy and have a name, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=93.06s)]
*  things that they have not had the chance [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=95.18s)]
*  to experience thus far. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=96.78s)]
*  What was so upsetting about this story was, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  nobody could say with a straight face, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=102.4s)]
*  well, these dogs are being killed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  so kids won't die of cancer. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=105.26s)]
*  There was no, there seemed to be no justifiable reason [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=106.9s)]
*  to torture these dogs to death. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=110.78s)]
*  Or am I missing something? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=112.26s)]
*  You are absolutely not missing something. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  And this is the tip of the iceberg. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=117.78s)]
*  We are thrilled for these 4,000 dogs. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=118.62s)]
*  But this facility was the second largest provider of dogs [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=121.12s)]
*  for experiments in this country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=124.28s)]
*  There is a larger facility in New York [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=126.44s)]
*  that has, believe it or not, 21,000 beagles. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=128.1s)]
*  These animals are bred and sold [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=131.12s)]
*  for absolutely pointless, painful experiments. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  And our federal government has bought dogs [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=136.2s)]
*  from this facility. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=138.6s)]
*  Since September of 2020, the NIH has had contracts [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=139.84s)]
*  for live dogs, at least three contracts. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=143.2s)]
*  It is time for the NIH to wake up, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  realize it's the 21st century, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  and move on to modern non-animal methods. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=150.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's just so much money sloshing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  around the system that to keep it flowing, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=155.76s)]
*  they invent experiments that benefit nobody. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=159.44s)]
*  So you can, you're saying, just to be totally clear [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  on our way out, in the next, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  how long until these dogs can be adopted by people watching? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=168.44s)]
*  The plan for transfer will take place over the next 60 days, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=173.3s)]
*  and we urge people to just keep an eye. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=177.34s)]
*  And we are just so thrilled [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=179.58s)]
*  that PETA's undercover investigation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=181.06s)]
*  prompted this domino effect [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  that resulted not only in 74 violations [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=185.0s)]
*  and the Department of Justice getting involved, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  but the liberation of these 4,000 dogs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  And we hope all the cages get emptied next, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  from all the laboratories and all the breeding facilities. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  This show is proudly for dogs, so we're celebrating. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLfNYkFeVA&t=198.98000000000002s)]
