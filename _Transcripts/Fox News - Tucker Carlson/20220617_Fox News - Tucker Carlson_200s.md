# Tucker Carlson: John Cornyn has decided to take guns from lawful gun owners
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes)
*  So there's a big push in the U.S. Senate to do something about so-called gun crime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=0.0s)]
*  So if you had a map of gun crime, that is crimes committed with guns, crimes in which [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=6.22s)]
*  people die by gunshot, you would notice that they are clustered in cities. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=11.46s)]
*  That's where the overwhelming majority of gun crime takes place. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=16.66s)]
*  But the Senate isn't trying to do anything about that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Instead, Democrats have decided this is a perfect opportunity in the wake of school [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=24.18s)]
*  shootings to disarm you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=27.82s)]
*  And the amazing thing is Mitch McConnell, the head Republican in the Senate, is on [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=29.96s)]
*  their side completely, and he's rounded up a group of ten Republicans who can help him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=34.62s)]
*  So the backbone of this package of legislation they're trying to get through is something [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  called a red flag law. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=44.36s)]
*  And in one sentence, a red flag law would allow the government to confiscate your firearms [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=45.92s)]
*  without even charging you with a crime, much less convicting you of one. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=50.2s)]
*  So who are these Republicans? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, the lead is John Cornyn of Texas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=54.4s)]
*  And the amazing thing about John Cornyn is he admits he doesn't care about gun crimes [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=57.94s)]
*  committed by actual criminals. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=62.9s)]
*  We know this from a piece today in Axios, and we're quoting. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=64.42s)]
*  Senator John Kennedy asked Cornyn during one lunch, quote, are we focused on gang violence [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=67.22s)]
*  and inner city murders? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=71.44s)]
*  And the response was, no, we're not focusing on that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  Well, if you're not focusing on that, why are you doing this exactly? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=75.38s)]
*  You don't need to guess about where gun crime comes from. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=81.94s)]
*  Here's a montage of some of the crimes that John Cornyn can't be bothered with. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=85.32s)]
*  A ring camera in the neighborhood captured the back and forth of gunfire as panicked [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=101.46s)]
*  teenagers ran through the street. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=105.96s)]
*  It's happened 26 times in just one week. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=108.42s)]
*  A string of robberies that all begin and end the same way. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=112.78s)]
*  NYPD video showing one of them where a team of armed suspects riding in a dark colored [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=115.14s)]
*  Mercedes Benz or Volkswagen Passat suddenly stopped their car, jump out, flash their guns, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=120.02s)]
*  rob their innocent victims, get back in the car and drive off. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=126.82s)]
*  Washington state alone has seen a record 85 armed robberies at cannabis stores so far [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=130.66s)]
*  this year. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=135.18s)]
*  This employee was shot six times. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  So crime is a complicated thing, but the crime spike that we're seeing now is not complicated [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=139.52s)]
*  at all. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=143.32s)]
*  Prosecutors across the country are refusing to enforce laws that we already have. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=144.32s)]
*  And when you do that, crime spikes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=150.02s)]
*  So if you're the United States Senate, if you're John Cornyn from Texas, supposedly [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=152.52s)]
*  free state of Texas, you'd probably want to do something about that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=155.64s)]
*  But no, John Cornyn has decided to take guns from lawful gun owners. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=159.0s)]
*  And if there's one reason you vote Republican, it's to prevent that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=163.84s)]
*  So it's not surprising that John Cornyn is very unpopular with Republican voters. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=168.04s)]
*  Watch his reception today at the Texas Republican Convention. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  Listen for the boos. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=175.16s)]
*  So let's take our country back, starting with Congress in November. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=176.16s)]
*  Thank you, God bless you, and may God continue to bless our great state of Texas. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=179.16s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=189.88s)]

*  I'm Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvFxflTNQes&t=197.44s)]
