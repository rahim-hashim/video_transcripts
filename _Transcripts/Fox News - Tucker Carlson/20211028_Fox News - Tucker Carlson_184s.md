# Youngkin: What’s happening in our education system is absolutely un-American
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk)
*  So Glenn Yonkin is running for governor of Virginia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=0.0s)]
*  as a Republican. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=3.0s)]
*  He's found himself right in the middle of this debate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=4.0s)]
*  He could win on Tuesday. He joins us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=6.0s)]
*  Glenn Yonkin, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=9.0s)]
*  So I don't think anybody at the beginning of this race [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=11.0s)]
*  thought it would be about this question. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=14.0s)]
*  Should parents have any influence over their own children? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=16.0s)]
*  Were you surprised that there, it turns out, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=19.0s)]
*  there are people who think that parents don't have a right [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=21.0s)]
*  to influence their own kids. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=23.0s)]
*  Well, Tucker, thanks for having me tonight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=26.0s)]
*  And no, I'm not surprised because Virginia's parents, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=28.0s)]
*  and particularly in Loudoun County, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=31.0s)]
*  where it's been ground zero, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=33.0s)]
*  they've been trying to stand up for their kids [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=34.0s)]
*  for the last 20 months. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=36.0s)]
*  Open our schools. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=38.0s)]
*  Stop teaching our kids what to think [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=39.0s)]
*  and teach them how to think. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=41.0s)]
*  Make sure we understand what's going on in the classroom. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=42.0s)]
*  And my opponent, he stood there and said, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=45.0s)]
*  no, parents do not have a right [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=47.0s)]
*  to know what's going on in the classroom. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=49.0s)]
*  And in fact, he doubled down on it and tripled down [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=51.0s)]
*  and quadrupled down on it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=53.0s)]
*  And then just yesterday, you know, he was with, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=54.0s)]
*  he was with President Biden yesterday, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=57.0s)]
*  and I'm sure they discussed this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=59.0s)]
*  He could have told President Biden, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=61.0s)]
*  President Biden, I'm siding with parents [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=63.0s)]
*  because in Virginia, by the way, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=65.0s)]
*  parents have a legal right to make decisions [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=67.0s)]
*  with regards to their children's education. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=71.0s)]
*  It's a legal right in Virginia. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=73.0s)]
*  And Terry McAuliffe told President Biden, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=74.0s)]
*  if he could, he did, he didn't, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=77.0s)]
*  they should change that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=79.0s)]
*  But what happened today was, of course, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=81.0s)]
*  Merrick Garland, he doubled down. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=83.0s)]
*  He doubled down. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=85.0s)]
*  He said, no, I'm absolutely maintaining my position [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=86.0s)]
*  that the DOJ and the FBI should be investigating parents, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=90.0s)]
*  parents who are trying to stand up for their children [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=93.0s)]
*  when there's been a sexual assault in a school bathroom. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=95.0s)]
*  And we have a board of education in Loudoun County [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=98.0s)]
*  that tried to hide it from parents, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=102.0s)]
*  hide it from, hide it from the public. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=104.0s)]
*  And they moved this child into another school. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=106.0s)]
*  And then that child again committed another sexual assault. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=109.0s)]
*  I've called for a full investigation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=113.0s)]
*  I've called for an investigation of the school board, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=114.0s)]
*  the Commonwealth attorney, the state superintendent. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=116.0s)]
*  I'll tell you, the attorney general of the United States [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=119.0s)]
*  should resign. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=122.0s)]
*  And oh, by the way, the FBI should be investigating [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=123.0s)]
*  these folks too. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=125.0s)]
*  This is just absolutely un-American. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=127.0s)]
*  And as governor in Virginia, I'm going to stand up for parents. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=129.0s)]
*  I'm going to stand up for children. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=132.0s)]
*  I'm going to stand up for the fundamental rights for parents [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=134.0s)]
*  to make decisions with regards to their kids' education. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=136.0s)]
*  This has absolutely got to stop. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=139.0s)]
*  And that's why I'm running Tucker, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=141.0s)]
*  because it's time for individual liberty to win over big government control. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=143.0s)]
*  And my opponent, Terry McAuliffe, he believes in big government control. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=148.0s)]
*  And I believe in parents' rights when it comes to their children's education [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=151.0s)]
*  to make decisions for them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, what they're really saying is we're your children's parents, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=157.0s)]
*  and you're not. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=160.0s)]
*  And on the basis of that alone, we are rooting for you, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=162.0s)]
*  Glenn Youngkin, on Tuesday in Virginia. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=164.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming on the show tonight. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=166.0s)]
*  Tucker, thank you for having me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=168.0s)]
*  This is a big moment for America too. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4j88p5EBk&t=169.0s)]
