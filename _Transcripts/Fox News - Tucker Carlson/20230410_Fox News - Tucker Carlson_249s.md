# Bud Light trans partnership faces backlash
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4)
*  So it used to be like five years ago, the idea was you do your thing, we do our thing, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=0.0s)]
*  we don't bother each other. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=6.2s)]
*  That was called tolerance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=7.2s)]
*  You want to dress up like a woman? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=8.2s)]
*  Fine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Now the rules have changed completely. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Worship me as I dress up like a woman or I'll crush you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=14.88s)]
*  That's why suddenly everything, even beer cans, are celebrating and promoting transgenderism. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=19.96s)]
*  Bud Light has just released a commemorative can celebrating a man who dresses up like [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=27.96s)]
*  a woman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  His name is Dylan Mulvaney. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=32.4s)]
*  Here's Alyssa Heiderscheid, who brags that she is the first female VP of Bud Light, telling [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  us that Bud Light loves Dylan Mulvaney but hates its own customers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  So I had this super clear mandate. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=47.96s)]
*  It's like we need to evolve and elevate this incredibly iconic brand. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  What does evolve and elevate mean? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  It means inclusivity. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  It means shifting the tone. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=57.12s)]
*  It means having a campaign that's truly inclusive and feels lighter and brighter and different [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=59.12s)]
*  and appeals to women and to men. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=66.08s)]
*  And representation is at sort of the heart of evolution. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=68.76s)]
*  You've got to see people who reflect you in the work. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=71.52s)]
*  And we had this hangover. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=74.84s)]
*  I mean, Bud Light had been kind of a brand of fratty, kind of out of touch humor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=76.32s)]
*  And it was really important that we had another approach. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=85.8s)]
*  Out of touch, fratty and out of touch. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=91.36s)]
*  Is there anyone more out of touch than that woman? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=93.92s)]
*  Is that woman the perfect physical embodiment of the problem in America? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=97.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=103.44s)]
*  How do people like that take charge of our country? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=104.92s)]
*  The least impressive, the dumbest, the most reactionary, the people who live in the tiniest [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=108.0s)]
*  little worlds, they run everything. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=112.32s)]
*  People who drink Bud Light are not impressed, is the truth. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  John Rich is one of them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  He is, of course, a famous singer-songwriter. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=119.76s)]
*  Country star, he joins us tonight with his thoughts on Bud Light going trans. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=122.08s)]
*  John, I appreciate you're coming on tonight. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=127.2s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=129.04s)]
*  Well, you know, there's a lot of smart, really high paid people, Tucker, that sit around [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=130.28s)]
*  big conference tables at all the major brands and they spend millions and millions and millions [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=135.84s)]
*  of dollars to market their product. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  To do what? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=142.28s)]
*  To sell more of it, whether it's beer or country music or a pickup truck or pretty much anything [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  you can think of. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=148.84s)]
*  And it's their right to market it however they want. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=150.28s)]
*  They're making a bet that this is going to sell more product. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=152.56s)]
*  And so, you know, I'm also in this world, you know, I sell music. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=155.48s)]
*  Redneck Riviera is a brand of mine that's nationwide. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  I keep it real simple. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=161.64s)]
*  I go God, family and country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=162.64s)]
*  If you love God, family and country, you'll probably love Redneck Riviera and it probably [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=165.56s)]
*  won't disappoint you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=169.34s)]
*  What's happening, Tucker, is people that have been loyal to brands for decades and decades [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=170.38s)]
*  are finding it hard to stay loyal to them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=175.66s)]
*  And so they start hunting down other brands that they can go support. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=178.5s)]
*  And there's tons of up and coming American brands out there that people are flooding [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=182.1s)]
*  to right now, kind of like mine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=186.28s)]
*  So you really got to hope, and I, you know, it's not even owned by the Bush family anymore, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=188.26s)]
*  but that Bud Light fails over this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=193.88s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to be mean. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=195.46s)]
*  I don't want root for bankruptcy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=196.9s)]
*  But in this case, I think we have to hope for that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=198.42s)]
*  I think the customers decide customers are king. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=202.62s)]
*  So I own a bar downtown in Nashville called Redneck Riviera and our number one selling [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  beer up until a few days ago was, guess what, Bud Light. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=210.46s)]
*  That was the number one beer. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=213.66s)]
*  We got cases and cases and cases of it sitting back there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  But in the past several days, you're hard pressed to find anybody ordering one. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=218.06s)]
*  So as the business owner, I just go, hey, if you guys aren't going to order it, we got [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=221.7s)]
*  to put something else in here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=225.74s)]
*  And at the end of the day, that's capitalism, right, Tucker? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=226.9s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=229.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=230.46s)]
*  And they make great targets. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=231.46s)]
*  You hit a Bud Light at 50 yards with a 223 and it just explodes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=232.46s)]
*  So I recommend that strongly. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=234.78s)]
*  John Rich, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=236.34s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr8OPmPE-j4&t=237.34s)]
