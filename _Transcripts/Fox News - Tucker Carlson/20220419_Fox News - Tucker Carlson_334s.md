# Candace Owens: These are sick, sadistic people
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40)
*  Oh, a rare piece of good news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=0.0s)]
*  A federal judge has struck down the insane mask mandate [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=1.36s)]
*  on planes and trains. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=4.88s)]
*  The much beleaguered passenger class in this country [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=6.44s)]
*  celebrated upon hearing the news. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=9.48s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=11.68s)]
*  Masks are no longer required in domestic flights [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=13.36s)]
*  or at US airports while employees and customers [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=15.52s)]
*  are no longer required to wear a mask. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=17.44s)]
*  They may do so if they choose. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Woo! [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=21.2s)]
*  Masks will be optional this evening [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=23.84s)]
*  for all crew and passengers as well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  If you choose to, you may remove your mask. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=29.32s)]
*  Woo! [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=32.08s)]
*  Woo! [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=32.92s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=33.76s)]
*  Remove the mask mandate. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=34.6s)]
*  Woo! [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=36.72s)]
*  So everyone can use their masks [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=37.56s)]
*  and enjoy and celebrate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Woo! [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=42.84s)]
*  So the mask mandate never made sense on planes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=44.84s)]
*  The Air and Planes is filtered. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=46.92s)]
*  It's way safer than a restaurant. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=48.72s)]
*  The whole point of the mandate was to humiliate you [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  and get you to obey and people hated it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=52.68s)]
*  And the airlines knew they hated it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=55.24s)]
*  So almost every major carrier in the country [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=56.56s)]
*  lifted the mandates as soon as the judge allowed them to. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=58.84s)]
*  But Joe Biden's publicist, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=62.0s)]
*  who was a dedicated enemy of human happiness [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  and really ought to be teaching in a kindergarten classroom [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  in New York City, said, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=68.36s)]
*  "'She's disappointed!' [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=69.4s)]
*  And the judge is ruling. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=71.44s)]
*  CDC recommended continuing the order [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=73.16s)]
*  for additional time, two weeks, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=75.36s)]
*  to be able to assess the latest science [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=77.36s)]
*  in keeping with its responsibility [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=80.04s)]
*  to protect the American people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=81.68s)]
*  So this is obviously a disappointing decision. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=83.88s)]
*  No one believes you anymore. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=87.12s)]
*  No one believes the CDC anymore. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=88.6s)]
*  You drained your credibility account over the last year [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  by lying to us. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=94.08s)]
*  You're a joke. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  They're the only ones that don't know it." [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=96.44s)]
*  And they don't know it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  A couple of hours ago, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=98.24s)]
*  the Biden administration announced [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  it will appeal the ruling if the CDC tells them to. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  If the CDC concludes a mandatory order remains necessary, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=103.56s)]
*  the DOJ will appeal. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=107.36s)]
*  The DOJ, nobody wants that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  The only people who are in favor of it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=111.96s)]
*  are the journalists who work for the administration, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=113.88s)]
*  which is virtually all of them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=116.08s)]
*  And they're thrilled at the possibility [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=117.72s)]
*  that the American population will once again be subjugated [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  because they deserve it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=121.6s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=122.76s)]
*  What do we need to know about this ruling? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=124.52s)]
*  Are we kind of in the Wild West? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=126.56s)]
*  It's every company for itself? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=128.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=131.16s)]
*  It's a mess. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=132.08s)]
*  Just because this ruling was made by a judge [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=133.76s)]
*  doesn't mean that suddenly the science has changed. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=136.76s)]
*  We know that masks remain very protective. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=139.72s)]
*  And this was basically Donald Trump [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=143.0s)]
*  as a federal judge today. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=144.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=147.56s)]
*  It absolutely reads like Donald Trump as a federal judge. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=148.4s)]
*  So what we've done is we've removed a travel mask mandate [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=152.88s)]
*  with an incredibly high level of virus. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=157.16s)]
*  And right now, as of today, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  it is less safe to fly in this country than it was yesterday. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=162.6s)]
*  She obviously is clueless. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  And the vast majority of scientific evidence is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=169.16s)]
*  masks have saved millions of lives. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=172.28s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=176.84s)]
*  Masks have saved millions of lives [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  and some low IQ politician has never had a job? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=180.8s)]
*  She knows the science. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  Candace Owens knows a lot more about science [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  than the lady you just heard. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=189.52s)]
*  She's the founder of Blexit. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=190.72s)]
*  We're always happy to have her on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  It's just, it's so unbelievable. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=193.16s)]
*  Their power's ebbing away and they're mad. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=199.16s)]
*  What we're looking at, these people, Tucker, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=200.0s)]
*  they're just, they're sick. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=201.08s)]
*  These are utterly sick, mentally unstable people [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=202.24s)]
*  who want people to suffer. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=204.72s)]
*  Out of sport, out of sheer sport. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=206.72s)]
*  We obviously know the science does not make sense. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=208.0s)]
*  It never makes sense. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=210.0s)]
*  Talk about science ever shifting. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly what the CDC specializes in. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  Making up things as they go along, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=214.88s)]
*  like they are actually, Simon says, in the child's game. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=217.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=220.32s)]
*  It is sad to me to see so many flight attendants [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=221.32s)]
*  celebrating and people that are in the seats [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=223.88s)]
*  because you realize people have just been suffering, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=225.44s)]
*  fearful that they're gonna go to prison. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=227.6s)]
*  The first announcement they hear, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=229.04s)]
*  if you don't comply, you can be arrested. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=230.28s)]
*  Imagine having a federal charge [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=232.48s)]
*  because you didn't wear a mask over your face. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=234.32s)]
*  We watch children suffer. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=236.44s)]
*  We watch special needs kids get kicked off of planes [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=237.72s)]
*  for their inability to keep their masks on their face, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=240.48s)]
*  as well as young kids, two years old, crying and screaming, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=244.08s)]
*  not understanding why they're being made to wear a mask. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=246.72s)]
*  And this is really just happening in America, by the way. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=249.32s)]
*  I've traveled all across Europe. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=251.56s)]
*  They've all released a mask mandate. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=253.2s)]
*  So this is not based in science. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=254.56s)]
*  This is just based in control. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=255.96s)]
*  The government took power. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=257.44s)]
*  They don't wanna give it back. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=258.4s)]
*  And to me, as happy as I am, as relieved as I am [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=259.8s)]
*  that I can go on a plane and not wear a mask, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=262.92s)]
*  I don't feel like this is a win [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=264.64s)]
*  because we shouldn't be cheering on the restoration [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=266.12s)]
*  of our basic human rights. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=268.56s)]
*  We should be infuriated [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  and we should wanna see these people face consequences. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=271.4s)]
*  Because guess what, Tucker? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=273.68s)]
*  The CDC broke the law. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=274.8s)]
*  That's what the ruling says. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=275.92s)]
*  It was unconstitutional. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=277.04s)]
*  Similarly, OSHA broke the law. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=278.52s)]
*  They were trying to overreach and decide [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=279.96s)]
*  if they could do things that they had entirely [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=281.48s)]
*  no powers to do so. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=283.08s)]
*  When regular people break the law, Tucker, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=284.4s)]
*  they go to prison. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=286.46s)]
*  Why is Rachel Walensky and the CDC [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=287.6s)]
*  and the members of the FDA and the drug cartel [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=289.64s)]
*  that's operating our country? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=291.76s)]
*  Any exception to that rule. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=293.24s)]
*  It's unacceptable. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=294.8s)]
*  And I'm not going to cheer until these people [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=295.8s)]
*  are behind bars. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=297.2s)]
*  What they have done to the dignity of human beings, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  forcing them to sit behind masks that we know [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=300.68s)]
*  do not work to stop the spread of the virus. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=302.88s)]
*  Now, I would say maybe Candace Owens [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=306.24s)]
*  is overstating the case. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=307.8s)]
*  And then I see that life expectancy [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=308.8s)]
*  for American citizens is down [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=310.48s)]
*  due to their mismanagement of COVID, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=312.28s)]
*  not from COVID, but due to their regulations. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=314.12s)]
*  And I think, you know, maybe you're right over the target. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  And so I appreciate it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=317.92s)]
*  Candace Owens, thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=318.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrtVEXxF40&t=320.12s)]
