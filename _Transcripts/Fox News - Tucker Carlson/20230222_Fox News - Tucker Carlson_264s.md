# California man recounts journey to 'detransition' after he sought therapy for drug issues
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik)
*  Brian Wagner was in his early 20s when, like so many young men, his life derailed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=0.0s)]
*  He became addicted to drugs, he was depressed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=5.32s)]
*  He also watched a lot of porn, and porn gave him the idea that he might, in fact, be a woman. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=7.4s)]
*  So he consulted doctors, and very quickly they put him on estrogen, and that made his problems much worse. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=12.0s)]
*  Brian Wagner no longer believes what his doctors told him. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=17.8s)]
*  He does not identify as female. He is back to how he was born, a man, and he joins us tonight to explain what he went through. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=21.72s)]
*  Brian, thank you so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=28.2s)]
*  If you could sum up the experience, I'm sure this is a three hour long conversation, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=31.08s)]
*  but if you could sum up the experience, the amazing experience you had, how would you describe it? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=35.56s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me on, Tucker. I appreciate it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=40.56s)]
*  Yeah, like you said, when I was a young man, when I was in college, about close to a decade ago, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=45.2s)]
*  I was extremely alienated. I had a drug problem, mainly crystal meth and other party drugs, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=53.28s)]
*  and I went down a bizarre rabbit hole of online pornography, and I developed a sex fetish. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=61.52s)]
*  Very embarrassing to say, but it's the truth. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=68.48s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=70.2s)]
*  And I went to go see a therapist who specialized in sex issues, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=70.68s)]
*  and she told me that I was really a woman and that she and I had the same brain, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=77.12s)]
*  and that basically all my problems in life were because I was actually a woman in a man's body, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=84.0s)]
*  even though I had severe drug problems, I had mood disorders and other, you know, issues. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=91.28s)]
*  I looked terrible when I went to go see this woman. I was underweight. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=98.72s)]
*  I was paranoid out of my mind from using methamphetamines. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=102.56s)]
*  And none of that mattered. It was all about having me go to a clinic to get prescribed estrogen [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=106.76s)]
*  and medicine to prevent my body from making testosterone, which I took for many years, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=114.12s)]
*  and all my problems got worse. It didn't help me. It just added new problems. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=119.48s)]
*  And I just feel like the therapist I went to go see was an activist who just so happened to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=126.44s)]
*  practice therapy, too. And here in California, there's really nothing to protect people from it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  Now it's even more, quite frankly, crazy. You can just go into one of these informed consent clinics, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=137.72s)]
*  and you don't even need a therapist's letter anymore. And it's completely patient-led. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=145.24s)]
*  It's the only form of medicine that's patient-led. So I just advocate for better safeguarding and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=150.84s)]
*  high-quality assessments, because I want to help everyone, whether you're detrans or transgender. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=157.64s)]
*  I want everyone to have good healthcare and everyone to be protected. And as it is now [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  detransitioning, I just feel like I'm collateral damage for a movement that I'm not even part of. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=167.88s)]
*  They completely ignore me, and they don't want to hear these stories. But my story is real. My [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=174.04s)]
*  pain is real. And yeah, it's a real thing. But I just thank God every single day of my life that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=180.04s)]
*  I never had any plastic surgery. I took hormones, and it messed me up. I had my facial hair removed, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=185.56s)]
*  but I do think that I'll be able to bounce back from this. And the way I always describe it, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=191.24s)]
*  Tucker, is I feel like once I got sober, I started to have actual gender dysphoria when people were [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=196.28s)]
*  treating me like a woman, when I didn't before. So yeah, I mean, it was like leaving the Twilight [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=203.56s)]
*  Zone. You know, some of the better episodes of The Twilight Zone is when the protagonist leaves [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=211.56s)]
*  The Twilight Zone, but everyone else is still in it. But yeah, and I just feel like I've been harmed [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=216.52s)]
*  by this, and I just wish that, you know, I don't want anyone else to experience what I experienced. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  So I'm out of The Twilight Zone, and you know, I'm a very happy and successful man. And you know, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=228.28s)]
*  I just hope that my experience helps somebody. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=237.4s)]
*  I don't even, that's one of the saddest stories I've heard in a long time. I don't have anything [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=241.16s)]
*  to add to it other than I hope you tell your story far and wide. I hope it's heard by a lot of people. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  I think you speak for many, and I'm grateful that you were willing to tell us your story. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=248.28s)]
*  Brian, thank you. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91U1bMWuik&t=252.51999999999998s)]
