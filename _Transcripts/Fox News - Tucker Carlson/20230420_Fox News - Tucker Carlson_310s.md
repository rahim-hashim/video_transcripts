# Tucker: This is a dark moment in our history
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo)
*  So castrate your children. That is the message. And some people bewilderingly are following that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=0.0s)]
*  There has been a huge surge of young people being castrated in the name of transgenderism. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Reuters recently reported that in the past few years, 56 minors between the ages of 13 to 17 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=13.6s)]
*  have undergone genital mutilation in clinics around the country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=19.36s)]
*  776 minors have undergone mastectomies, having their breasts cut off. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=24.72s)]
*  And more than 14,000 have been poisoned with hormone treatment, which will, in a lot of cases, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=29.12s)]
*  sterilize them for life, cause them osteoporosis and other problems. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=36.08s)]
*  So obviously, this is a very dark moment in our history. A civilized country would not put up with that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=41.04s)]
*  Hungary has a Child Protection Act which prevents any of this crap from going on, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=46.32s)]
*  children from being sexualized. And because it has taken a stand against sexualizing children, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=51.84s)]
*  Hungary is being sued by over a dozen EU member states. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  Bocs Orban is the political director for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=60.88s)]
*  one of the smartest people we've ever talked about politics, and he joins us tonight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=65.6s)]
*  Bosz, thank you so much for coming on. So you are taking an unpopular position [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  that I think will be vindicated by history. You personally vindicated by history. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  But right now it's got to be hard. Why are you sticking to your position in Hungary? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=78.88s)]
*  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much, Tucker, for the nice words. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=87.92s)]
*  And thank you for having me. Well, actually, the whole story started around 2021 when we in Hungary [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=88.0s)]
*  started to realize that something is coming. It's like a storm which is coming. Vogue ideology, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=96.08s)]
*  LGBTQ propaganda is arriving to Hungary, to schools, through media and through NGOs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=103.04s)]
*  You can imagine how a grassroots, normal Hungarian citizen reacted on that. We don't have [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=111.68s)]
*  the word Vogue in Hungarian. People were asking, what are you talking about? Vogue? Is that the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  French magazine or what? But then they started to realize that this is something serious. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  And when we introduced the Child Protection Bill, which bans [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=133.2s)]
*  transgenderism and LGBTQ propaganda for minors, then the whole Brussels bureaucracy and European [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=139.92s)]
*  Union were going against us. Then we decided to turn towards the people, and we organized a national [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=148.88s)]
*  referendum when almost 4 million people said no to gender propaganda and said yes to child protection [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=156.96s)]
*  law. It's compared to the size of America. It would mean almost 130 million supportive votes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  But then as it happens, the empire strikes back, and the Brussels and deep state, it's very similar [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  to the DC one. It started a legal persecution against Hungary, which is backed by many Western [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=182.16s)]
*  European countries. Eastern European countries think differently, but there is an ongoing, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=190.72s)]
*  really political and legal, court war. But we try to keep the fronts up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=195.92s)]
*  So it sounds like you're not going to back down. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=202.4s)]
*  No, definitely not. And you know, the Hungarian people are behind us. So this is their [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=204.96s)]
*  expectation. My job is not to be popular among the Brussels and elites, but to represent the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=211.76s)]
*  interests of my people in Brussels. This is why we have no other chance just to take the battle. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  You anticipated my question amazingly. I was going to ask, does the public support this? So just to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=226.64s)]
*  be really clear in closing, a democracy is a government that represents the will of its people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  You're often called a dictatorship, but this policy reflects what Hungarians want, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=237.28s)]
*  just to be clear. Is that right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=243.28s)]
*  True, true. This is what Hungarian wants. It's out of question. And if the media, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=245.12s)]
*  the state, the big powers are against you, only backing is the support of the people. We are [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=252.72s)]
*  very grateful for that, and we have to serve them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=259.92s)]
*  Yeah. So if Samantha Power doesn't like it, you're a dictatorship, right? I got it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=264.48s)]
*  If you are not with us, then you are a dictatorship. This is how this foreign policy [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  looks like. USAID immediately launched a central European program. She visited our country, and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=278.48s)]
*  they really are ready to enlighten us. Yeah, I would keep her out of your country [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=286.56s)]
*  if I were you. Blas Orban, coming from one of the last democracies in the West, Hungary, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=291.84s)]
*  thanks so much for coming on tonight. Thank you very much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAfGKyM5szo&t=296.47999999999996s)]
