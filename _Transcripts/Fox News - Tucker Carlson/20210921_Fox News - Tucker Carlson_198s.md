# Stephen Miller issues dire warning: 'There won't be a country if this happens'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4)
*  Stephen Miller is a former advisor to the Trump White House. He joins us tonight to assess what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=0.0s)]
*  we're seeing. This seems like a complete collapse and a disaster. You know, I don't... [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=4.16s)]
*  cable news is famous for overstatement. I don't want to be that guy, but the pictures suggest it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=10.32s)]
*  How do you assess it? The only danger right now, Tucker, is that we understate the problem. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=15.52s)]
*  The only danger is that we fail to convey to people what is happening before our very eyes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=21.68s)]
*  Every few days, a camp the size of Del Rio is admitted into our country, day after day, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=27.76s)]
*  week after week. Let me tell you a story. I was talking to a frontline immigration officer who [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=35.36s)]
*  works in Arizona. He says that people from all around the world, they book flights to Tijuana, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  they book flights to northern border towns in Mexico, they pay a small bus fare to drive one [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  hour to the border in Arizona, they walk up to border agents, they turn themselves in, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=52.48s)]
*  children, families, teenagers, and single adults on the certainty, on the certainty that they will [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  be admitted into the country. That is how mad things have gotten. You know, Benjamin Franklin [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=65.6s)]
*  said when describing our form of government that we have a republic if you can keep it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  It is not hyperbole, but fact to say that at this moment in time, we do not have a republic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=76.72s)]
*  because the basic principle of a republic is self-government by citizens. And so if you have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=82.55999999999999s)]
*  millions of uninvited people, and the citizens of this country have no ability to exercise control [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=88.72s)]
*  over who can join the polity, then it is no longer a republic because all of your work, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  all of your sweat, all of your toil will go to benefit people who have no right to be here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  That is where we are right now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=107.28s)]
*  You know, I have asked this before and I do not want to single out the governor of Texas, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=110.24s)]
*  who I think is a nice person. I agree with him on a lot and everything, Greg Abbott. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=114.48s)]
*  But it seems to me the only solution I can think of anyway is for the Texas National Guard to say, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=118.88s)]
*  it is our state, we are securing our border, you cannot do this. And if that provokes some kind of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=124.16s)]
*  crisis with the federal government, so be it. But why does not he do that? Is there some reason that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=128.88s)]
*  I cannot think of? What you are describing is the use of article 4 section 4, and that relates [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=133.44s)]
*  exactly to the point that I was making. It is known as the guarantee clause, and it says that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=139.12s)]
*  the federal government in effect shall guarantee to every state a republican form of government, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=143.68s)]
*  protection against invasion, and protection against domestic violence. All three, all three of those [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=149.6s)]
*  tasks have been failed by the Biden administration. So they are violating their commitments under [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=156.48s)]
*  article 4 section 4, which I would argue does in fact empower any border state to control their own [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=161.92s)]
*  sovereign territory. And if they do not, and if somebody does not hold this presidency accountable, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=170.72s)]
*  there will not be a country in a period of time. I agree with that. Greg Abbott is the one man who [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=176.32s)]
*  can stop this. Let us hope he does it tonight for real. Stephen Miller, thank you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvQ9RI4Rdm4&t=181.2s)]
