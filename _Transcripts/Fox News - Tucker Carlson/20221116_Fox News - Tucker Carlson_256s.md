# Womenâ€™s rights activist speaks out after receiving threats from trans demonstrators
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA)
*  A new tour called Let Women Speak is intended to give women an opportunity to speak about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=0.0s)]
*  gender ideology. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=4.4s)]
*  Yesterday the event arrived in New York City, it was near City Hall in Manhattan, and very [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=5.92s)]
*  quickly trans activists descended on the event and began threatening the attendees. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=10.36s)]
*  I'm a beat your ass. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=16.36s)]
*  I'm a beat your ass. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=21.36s)]
*  I'm a beat your ass. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=26.36s)]
*  I will. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=29.72s)]
*  These hands do not discriminate. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=30.72s)]
*  These hands do not discriminate. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=32.72s)]
*  I will. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=34.72s)]
*  These are more real than you would ever be. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=35.72s)]
*  I got bodies. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=38.72s)]
*  No man wants you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=40.72s)]
*  No man wants you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=43.72s)]
*  I'd love to ask the producers of the show why one individual's chest was blurred and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=45.72s)]
*  the others was not. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=49.92s)]
*  I can't figure out the distinguishing factor. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=51.36s)]
*  The police in this incident say nine people were arrested at the event. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=54.16s)]
*  Gina Hoke is a pro-female activist. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=58.2s)]
*  She was among the attendees who was threatened in that video you just saw. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=60.56s)]
*  She was on the other side of those threats and she joins us now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=64.68s)]
*  Gina, thanks for being with me tonight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  What did that feel like in the moment? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=70.0s)]
*  What was happening? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=71.36s)]
*  What was the energy around that event? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=73.64s)]
*  Danger. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=76.76s)]
*  That was the energy around that event. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=78.76s)]
*  It was very high energy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=80.72s)]
*  It was not good. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't think I expected it to be that bad. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=86.04s)]
*  Obviously we were threatened. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=90.16s)]
*  Women were assaulted. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=92.08s)]
*  Police were assaulted. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=94.6s)]
*  I can't believe actually how much abuse they put up with and it's upsetting to see the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=95.6s)]
*  spin in the newspaper that it was either an equal fight or that the police were being [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  brutal against people because that was not the case at all. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  Tell me what your organization is, I assume on the other side of this incident, peacefully [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=113.0s)]
*  protesting. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=117.8s)]
*  What are you hoping to highlight? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=118.8s)]
*  I came out to join the Let Women Speak tour this last couple of weeks because I wanted [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  to exercise my right to free speech with other women. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=128.28s)]
*  We came out again to be peaceful and talk about the harms of trans ideology. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=131.22s)]
*  We're all across the board politically, all ages, all abilities, education, everything, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  and we're joining together because we know what is happening and we want people to know [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=147.24s)]
*  we want to go to the streets and talk to anybody who is passing by and who will listen. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=151.08s)]
*  It's almost as though the individuals there in the video that we're seeing on the side [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=155.8s)]
*  of the screen were intent on proving your point. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  Your event is Let Women Speak and now you have these men dressed up as women attempting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  to shout you down at the very least. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=167.24s)]
*  Shout you down. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=169.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=170.24s)]
*  This is a record of our descent and they are doing the work for us. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=171.24s)]
*  They always come out, they show themselves to be. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=175.58s)]
*  Everything that we say is the reason that we do not want these people and these men, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  these violent men for the most part, in our spaces intended for women and girls. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=184.02s)]
*  And as you've traveled the country, I'm just curious, what has been your sense of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=189.74s)]
*  safety? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=192.78s)]
*  Has there been a particularly bad incident in New York or have you been met with this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=194.26s)]
*  type of reaction all across America? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=197.18s)]
*  All across America. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=200.58s)]
*  I attended San Francisco, Portland, Seattle was canceled due to threats of violence, credible [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=201.58s)]
*  threats of violence. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=209.38s)]
*  We were attacked in Tacoma and obviously yesterday in New York City there were security guards [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=211.38s)]
*  for Austin, Chicago, D.C. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=217.9s)]
*  Arrests made in Tacoma, Washington, D.C. and New York City. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=221.5s)]
*  What a wild situation today that this right here is controversial, that you standing up [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=225.78s)]
*  for women. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=230.5s)]
*  What used to be the embodiment of feminism today is now called bigotry. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=231.7s)]
*  What a fascinating and sad moment of American history. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvpKoh54gA&t=237.02s)]
