# Glenn Greenwald: The government is lying about the war in Ukraine
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg)
*  Glenn Greenwald has seen stories like this very, very up close and personal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the host of System Update on Rumble. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=5.5s)]
*  He broke, of course, the most famous leaking story in American history, the story of Ed [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=7.76s)]
*  Snowden. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=12.4s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=13.4s)]
*  Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=14.4s)]
*  I should say, and I'll just be quiet and let you speak since you know this better than [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=15.4s)]
*  anyone, but we left out a lot of details that are being reported in the Washington Post [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=19.56s)]
*  and the New York Times, et cetera, tonight about the leaker and where this all came from. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=24.0s)]
*  Because honestly, I don't believe anything, and it's very hard to know what's true. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=27.28s)]
*  We're all being spun, we're all being lied to, and we just didn't want to repeat the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  lies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=33.96s)]
*  So with that, what do you make of this? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=34.96s)]
*  I can't think of an incident, Tucker, that reveals more vividly the real function of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=37.68s)]
*  our nation's largest media corporations than what just happened here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=42.94s)]
*  If you're a real journalist, somebody who's devoted to transparency, shining a light on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=46.64s)]
*  the most powerful government actors when they lied to the American people and informing [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=52.44s)]
*  the public, you would be celebrating this person who stepped forward and risked his [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=56.08s)]
*  security to show his fellow citizens that the government was lying about this incredibly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=60.72s)]
*  important war with a nuclear armed power that we have actual troops deployed on the ground [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=66.48s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=71.52s)]
*  There's going to be no diplomatic resolution throughout at least 2023 that Zelensky is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=72.52s)]
*  planning on using our weapons to strike deep into Russia, which we were told would never [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=77.2s)]
*  happen, risking escalation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=81.08s)]
*  He did the job of what journalists claim to do, which is show the public the truth. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=83.2s)]
*  If you work for the intelligence agencies, you would be furious at this person. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=88.76s)]
*  You would hate him because he revealed that you just lied. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  He exposed the truth about what you were doing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  What's amazing is the New York Times, the Washington Post, all the people who were at [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  that Pentagon briefing today think the way the CIA and the Pentagon think. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=102.64s)]
*  They hate this person. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  It was the New York Times and the Washington Post that did the FBI's work and found the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=109.16s)]
*  leaker and led the FBI to him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=112.92s)]
*  They're demanding that he be punished. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=115.56s)]
*  They're demanding that the government clamp down and keep things more and more secret. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=117.24s)]
*  What kind of journalists would ever do that, would want to see a leaker exposed and punished [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=122.48s)]
*  and then demand that the government keep even more secret? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=127.04s)]
*  But that is what these media corporations are there to do. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=130.64s)]
*  They love leaks when the CIA and Homeland Security tell them to leak. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=134.48s)]
*  That's when they disseminate propaganda to the public, like they did during the Trump [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=139.48s)]
*  years when they leaked the transcript between Michael Flynn and Ambassador Kislyak, the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=142.56s)]
*  most serious kind of leaking crime. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=147.2s)]
*  The Washington Post did that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=149.2s)]
*  Nobody looked for that leaker. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Nobody cared. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  Everybody cheered because it served the interests of the security state. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  But when it comes to transparency that undermines the agenda of these agencies and that proves [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  what the truth is, it's amazing that these journalists are on the side of the government [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=162.08s)]
*  and will actually hunt down the leaker and demand that he be punished even more. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  I just don't understand how any journalist could collaborate in hiding the fact that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  we're in a direct hot war with Russia. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  Maybe you support that, maybe you don't. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=182.58s)]
*  But how could you hide something that significant, the most significant fact of our generation [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=184.18s)]
*  from the public? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=188.84s)]
*  How could you do that? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=189.84s)]
*  The only answer is that you don't actually have a journalistic mindset that you far more [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=190.84s)]
*  identify with your job as working for the government than working for the American people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  If you look at the history of the most important journalism stories, it's exactly insiders [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=203.16s)]
*  like Daniel Ellsberg sees that the government is lying to the American people about the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=207.2s)]
*  war in Vietnam, saying we're winning when in reality privately they're saying we're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  losing and he goes and he shows the American people the truth. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=214.96s)]
*  Or Edward Snowden who heard James Clapper falsely deny the NSA was spying on American [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=218.46s)]
*  people, he had the evidence in his hand and he risked his security to show the truth. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=223.5s)]
*  Same things WikiLeaks did. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=227.5s)]
*  This is what you celebrate in journalism. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  Our journalists, meaning the media corporations, hate this because they actually work for their [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=231.38s)]
*  government. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  That is their true allegiance. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  You have to defend truth tellers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  You cannot abet lying if you have an entire country based on lies. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  It just does not end well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=246.26000000000002s)]
*  You have to tell the truth, I think. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=247.38s)]
*  You're certainly a living example of that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=249.98s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald, thank you very much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=251.34s)]
*  Thanks Tucker. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BesXzq2Cdlg&t=253.62s)]
