# Why don’t we ask real questions about Jan. 6?: Schlapp
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8)
*  They supported the BLM riots of 2020, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=0.0s)]
*  almost every member of the January 6th committee did. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=2.5s)]
*  A lot of them supported the riots in Los Angeles in 1992. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=5.36s)]
*  Now they're telling you they oppose riots, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=9.72s)]
*  but we have the evidence. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=12.76s)]
*  They've gone on the record supporting political violence [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=15.6s)]
*  when it suits them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=19.16s)]
*  So for example, in 1992, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=20.88s)]
*  now a member of the January 6th committee, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=24.2s)]
*  was an assistant professor at American University, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=26.34s)]
*  Washington College of Law. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=28.68s)]
*  He said he hoped there wouldn't be a quote, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=30.36s)]
*  backlash to the race riots in Los Angeles in 1992. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=32.16s)]
*  Now 63 people were murdered, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=36.92s)]
*  heavily for their skin color by the way. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=39.32s)]
*  There were thousands of injuries, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=41.94s)]
*  there was a billion dollars in property damage. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=43.6s)]
*  Reginald Denny was ripped out of his truck [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  and beaten nearly to death on camera, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  but Jamie Raskin wasn't bothered by any of this at all. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=49.44s)]
*  What he was worried about was the rioters. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  People sense that justice was not done [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=56.08s)]
*  in the verdict that came down in the state criminal court. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=58.16s)]
*  And I would just hope that President Bush [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=62.36s)]
*  doesn't anticipate or encourage a backlash [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=65.36s)]
*  against the rioting which followed the verdict. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=68.52s)]
*  Yeah, Reginald Denny. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  What did Reginald Denny do wrong? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=75.08s)]
*  He was hauling a load of cinder blocks [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=76.16s)]
*  to the wrong neighborhood and he had the wrong skin color [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=78.08s)]
*  so they beat him almost gave him brain damage. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  But that's cool. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  That same year, the chairman of the January 6th committee, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=84.14s)]
*  today that would be Benny Thompson, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  decided he couldn't condemn rioting. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=89.0s)]
*  Instead, he said he was worried about injustices [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=91.4s)]
*  against black officials in Los Angeles at the time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=94.52s)]
*  Well, the injustice was happening on the streets of LA [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=99.6s)]
*  as the city was torched and race riots were in progress, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=102.12s)]
*  but he couldn't denounce it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=104.64s)]
*  Matt Schlapp is the chairman of CPAC, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=106.68s)]
*  he joins us tonight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=108.0s)]
*  Matt, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=108.84s)]
*  So it's a little much for this very same, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=110.7s)]
*  but precisely the same people who have no problem [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=115.7s)]
*  with real political violence, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=118.98s)]
*  grandstanding hyperventilating [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=121.18s)]
*  about what happened on January 6th. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=123.42s)]
*  Why does no one point this out? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=124.9s)]
*  Yeah, and why does it have to be shown on your show? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the public records of these elected officials [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=129.94s)]
*  is there for the entire media to see. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=132.7s)]
*  The hypocrisy of all the times they've taken to the floor [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=135.08s)]
*  and taken to media to say that people like Donald Trump [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=138.74s)]
*  were not legitimately elected presidents. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=141.66s)]
*  All the times they have not condemned violence, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=144.1s)]
*  or in this case, you have the chairman of the committee [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=146.18s)]
*  and this other member from Maryland, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=148.9s)]
*  basically saying, oh, riots are fine [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=151.06s)]
*  if you have a social grievance. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, why is it okay for Jamie Raskin to go to the floor [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=155.82s)]
*  of the House of Representatives in 2016 [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=159.86s)]
*  and say that Donald Trump was not legitimately elected, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=162.7s)]
*  that this ranking, this chairman, Betty Thompson, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=166.22s)]
*  can say that Donald Trump is illegitimate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=169.8s)]
*  and boycott his inauguration, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=172.18s)]
*  but when a retired teacher or a mom or a dad [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=174.62s)]
*  or somebody wants to go to their Capitol [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=178.06s)]
*  and protest what they saw as an election [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=180.5s)]
*  rife with lots of questions and fraudulent voting, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=183.34s)]
*  somehow there's something untoward [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=187.02s)]
*  with their desire to speak up. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=189.02s)]
*  Why can't they also speak up? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=191.38s)]
*  And why did Benny Thompson say that Josh Hawley [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=193.62s)]
*  and Ted Cruz should be on the no-fly list [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=196.54s)]
*  for raising legitimate questions about the 2020 election? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=199.86s)]
*  This two-tiered justice system, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=204.02s)]
*  this two-tiered idea that if you're a conservative [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=206.5s)]
*  or you're a Republican or you're a Trump supporter, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  you get through this kind of ghetto justice [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=212.16000000000003s)]
*  and if you are somebody else [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=214.62s)]
*  who has these progressive views, it's fine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  It's just a grievance and you have a right to express it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  Most Americans don't have the time to kind of follow this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=221.86s)]
*  They sense something's really amiss. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=224.18s)]
*  That's why they vote for members of the United States Senate [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=225.5s)]
*  who represent their views, their interest to keep them safe [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=227.5s)]
*  from the overreach of lunatics [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=230.06s)]
*  like Benny Thompson and Liz Cheney. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=231.62s)]
*  So where is Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=233.62s)]
*  Shoot more Trump voters. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=237.26s)]
*  Like, don't normal people deserve representation? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=238.62s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=243.22s)]
*  And I think that's part of the questions on all of this, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=244.5s)]
*  which is if you want to ask real questions about 1-6, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=247.66s)]
*  why don't we ask them? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=251.54s)]
*  Why don't we find out the reason [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=252.7s)]
*  why the Capitol Police Force, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=254.3s)]
*  we just found out through our FOIA this week [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=255.66s)]
*  because of Tom Fitton at Judicial Watch [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=257.82s)]
*  that the Capitol Police going into 1-6 was at 50% strength. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=259.82s)]
*  How come that was allowed to happen? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=263.26s)]
*  How come that was okay? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=264.74s)]
*  We all knew it was gonna be a tumultuous emotional day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  These are the questions they didn't want to answer. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=268.98s)]
*  You know why, Tucker? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=270.82s)]
*  Because when the political violence benefits them, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=272.14s)]
*  they just turned a blind eye toward it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=274.94s)]
*  When real Americans have outrage, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=276.7s)]
*  they want to put them in jail. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=279.32s)]
*  Yeah, I've noticed. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=280.94s)]
*  Matt Slatt, thank you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8tV_x0WS8&t=281.94s)]
