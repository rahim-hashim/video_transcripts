# Tucker: What are we getting for $1.2 trillion?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. Think back, you may remember Joe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden's infrastructure bill this fall. That bill emerged from Congress in November with [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  the price tag of $1.2 trillion. That's so many zeros it's hard to imagine. How much [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  is it? Well, it's more than the entire GDP of the nation of Mexico. One of the world's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=17.68s)]
*  biggest oil producers, by the way. So that's a ton of money. So for a bill that size, you [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=22.06s)]
*  would expect, well, big results. You'd certainly want better roads than they've got in Mexico. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=26.24s)]
*  So are we getting those? What are we getting exactly from that bill? Well, today the Transportation [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  Department, which is now run by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, finally told us the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=36.599999999999994s)]
*  answer. Effective immediately, we learned. This country will undergo a, quote, paradigm [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=40.96s)]
*  shift in the way we think about infrastructure. Now hold on a minute. As you probably noticed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=46.22s)]
*  by this point, the moment paradigms start shifting, you can be certain a whole lot of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=52.44s)]
*  people are about to get shafted. Nothing personal. It's just the nature of paradigms. They don't [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=57.28s)]
*  just shift. They tend to topple over and crush innocent bystanders. And this paradigm, of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=61.64s)]
*  course, is no different. According to the new paradigm we learned about today, infrastructure [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  is no longer about roads and bridges and airports and train stations and things you might actually [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=72.16s)]
*  use in the course of your life. We could fix those things, but why bother? Mayor Pete has [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=77.44s)]
*  better ideas. Here's Mr. Douglas M. Hoff, the profoundly unemployed husband of Kamala [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=82.83999999999999s)]
*  Harris to explain. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=88.8s)]
*  So when we talk about transportation, we're not just talking about buildings and roads [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  and bridges, all that important stuff as well. But we're talking about the safety of our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  children, the safety of our families. And this, as you know, is something that President [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=102.48s)]
*  Biden, Vice President Harris, Secretary Buttigieg, this entire Department of Transportation, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=108.84s)]
*  this administration deeply understands. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  Deeply understand. And when they kind of grin and go like that, you know you're about to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=119.0s)]
*  get screwed. We're not just talking about things you care about anymore, Mr. and Mrs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=125.64s)]
*  America, those stupid buildings and roads and bridges, things that you can touch. We're [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=130.56s)]
*  talking about bigger things now. We're talking about vast structural problems, problems so [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=135.52s)]
*  big that unemployed Doug Emhoff can't even really describe them, much less solve them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  Things like, quote, the safety of our children and our families. Turns out big problems are [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=145.28s)]
*  a lot safer to talk about in speeches because you can't actually do anything about them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=150.52s)]
*  So there are no expectations. Roads and bridges and buildings are very different from that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=154.68s)]
*  They need concrete and asphalt and rebar, stuff that's expensive and hard to do. And [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=159.48s)]
*  that may be why our buildings, roads and bridges are falling apart. According to the American [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=164.32s)]
*  Society of Civil Engineers, which keeps track of these things, there are more than 617,000 [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  bridges in this country. And as of tonight, more than 46,000 of those bridges are considered, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  quote, structurally deficient. That means they're in terrible shape. Kind of a big deal [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  for a bridge. As for our roads, fully 43% of all public roadways in this country are, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=184.36s)]
*  quote, in poor or mediocre condition. In other words, we actually are Mexico, though a lot [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  richer. So what are we going to do about this? What is the $1.2 trillion plan going to do [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  for our crumbling infrastructure? Well, Pete Buttigieg has a plan. Here it is. More speed [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  cameras. According to the Associated Press, Buttigieg would like to, quote, promote greater [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=206.68s)]
*  use of speed cameras, which the department says could provide more equitable enforcement [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=211.24s)]
*  than police traffic stops. Got that? So because of equity, you're about to get a lot more [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=217.16s)]
*  speeding tickets from robots. See how that works? Shut up, racists, pay the fine. The [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  government does need the money for infrastructure, even after $1.2 trillion. A recent New York [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=228.8s)]
*  Times piece put it this way, quote, when California voters approved a bond in 2008 for a high-speed [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=233.56s)]
*  rail system from LA to San Francisco. The project was supposed to cost $33 billion and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=239.08s)]
*  be completed by 2020. That job is now projected to finish in 2033 for $100 billion, though [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=243.84s)]
*  those estimates are dated and there is an $80 billion funding gap. So infrastructure [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  is expensive. Actually, no one really knows how much infrastructure costs because infrastructure [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=257.48s)]
*  never gets completed. There are still working trains in the state of California. Unfortunately, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=261.24s)]
*  they're now getting robbed, just like they were in the 1870s. Return to the future. Union [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  Pacific is now contemplating abandoning the state after more than 150 years. They're kind [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=271.84s)]
*  of a big deal. What does Mayor Pete think of this? He's the transportation secretary. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=276.64s)]
*  He hasn't said a single word about it. Of course, it has nothing to do with equity, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=279.88s)]
*  so it's beneath his radar. By the way, it's not just trains that are in trouble in this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  country. We're also short 80,000 truck drivers, and that could be part of the reason that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=288.08s)]
*  these shelves at your local grocery store are getting bare. And it's not just trucks [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=292.84s)]
*  either. By next year, airlines are expected to be short more than 10,000 pilots. And that's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=296.56s)]
*  why, between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, airlines canceled more than 10,000 flights. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=303.56s)]
*  That was this year. Good luck getting to Florida next year. Now, there are other causes of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  the cancellations, none of which Mayor Pete is doing anything to fix. He's for vax mandates, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=314.32s)]
*  of course. That was a huge cause of the shortage this year. And then there are others. So the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=319.28s)]
*  president of Emirates, probably the best airline in the world, a man called Tim Clark, recently [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=324.2s)]
*  slammed Mayor Pete and the administration for the disastrous rollout of 5G technology [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  near airports. That led to a total suspension of Emirates flights. Clark said it was, quote, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=333.73999999999995s)]
*  one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible decisions he's ever seen in his long career. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  Fox's Casey Stegel just covered the collapse of the transportation network in this nation. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=344.88s)]
*  Here's an overview. More chaos for folks trying to get home after the holidays. I've been [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=349.76s)]
*  here since last night. Yeah, so they canceled. And now I'm getting a flight with United, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=355.28s)]
*  hopefully leaving this afternoon. Airlines canceling thousands of flights on Tuesday [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=361.8s)]
*  and delaying thousands more, leaving anxious passengers stranded and frustrated at airports [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=366.24s)]
*  around the country. The widespread groundings and delays due to a combination of winter [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=371.76s)]
*  weather and COVID-19 staffing disruptions on flights and also around airports. The winter [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=375.92s)]
*  weather not only affecting air travel drivers also facing traffic snags due to snow and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=383.0s)]
*  icy roads. Hundreds stranded overnight on a 50 mile stretch of I-95 near Fredericksburg, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=388.76s)]
*  Virginia. Well, things were bad in Virginia, but it's not just Virginia. Officials in Connecticut [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=394.64s)]
*  recently reported 285 car crashes because of, quote, icy weather. Oh, forgot to salt the roads. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=400.4s)]
*  Same in New York state, Westchester County. People killed. Oh, forgot to salt the roads. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=408.0s)]
*  The feds didn't salt the roads. People died. What does that do with equity? So here you have roads [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  you can't drive on, airports that don't work, planes that don't take off, and trains that are [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=421.52s)]
*  getting robbed. These are not small things. When your transportation network falls apart in a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=426.0s)]
*  continental country, things grind to a halt. Everything depends upon moving objects and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=431.84s)]
*  people from one place to another because it's a huge country. So if you have problems like these, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=438.32s)]
*  which are central to our economy and the way we live to the country itself, it might be a good idea [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=443.68s)]
*  to hire a competent transportation secretary, but that's not what the Biden administration did. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=449.52s)]
*  They had a more progressive idea. Joe Biden hired a kid, by contrast, who had never had a real job [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=454.4s)]
*  outside McKinsey and no grounding of any kind in physical reality. We know this because he was the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=461.84s)]
*  mayor of South Bend. So what's the infrastructure life like in South Bend? Well, when Pete Buttigieg [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=470.32s)]
*  was mayor, the city had him recording now the worst pothole situation in the state, according [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=478.32s)]
*  to the local paper. Huge potholes. So big that Mayor Pete, not a tall man, could have disappeared [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=484.0s)]
*  into one. You can picture his little legs up in the air. Eight years as mayor, and he was never [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=491.28s)]
*  able to fix it. With just enough resources to replenish the paving of every lane mile of street [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=496.8s)]
*  in our city, only every 100 years or so, I faced a constant battle with that natural enemy of all [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=504.48s)]
*  mayors, the pothole. So it's a guy who literally couldn't fix the potholes in South Bend, Indiana, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=512.16s)]
*  is now the transportation secretary, but he breast feeds, so it's equity. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=522.64s)]
*  It's unbelievable. Pretty amusing. This is a guy who wouldn't know a car transmission from a [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=526.4s)]
*  bridge abutment. What are the chances he can run his own espresso machine? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=535.12s)]
*  The mindset is the problem here, and it's not just Mayor Pete. He's easy to mock because he's a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=539.76s)]
*  ludicrous figure, but it's all the people like him who believe that our economy is based on [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  social media apps and HR departments. People like that really believe that by social engineering, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=549.68s)]
*  you can make the trains run on time, and you can create a robust economy because they're morons. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  For example, last week Mayor Pete explained that the number one priority of the transportation [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=564.16s)]
*  department in the middle of a massive shortage of transportation workers, trains are getting robbed, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=571.28s)]
*  planes that won't take off, is equity. So you know what we need to do? We need to work extra hard [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=576.56s)]
*  to screen out anybody who might be working in our transportation industry who happens to have the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=583.5999999999999s)]
*  wrong skin color. Watch. You look at something like the investment in transit, you know, it's [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  Americans of color, commuters of color, who are most likely to depend on that. You look at the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=594.0s)]
*  jobs we're going to create, and yeah, they have been traditionally white and male, but it doesn't [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=598.16s)]
*  have to stay that way. We are working with a lot of focus at the direction of the president to make [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=602.16s)]
*  sure that everything from the contracting opportunities for small business to the labor [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  opportunities for workers, fixing the bridges, installing the electric vehicle charging stations, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=611.6s)]
*  are more likely to be workers of color, are more likely to be women. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  So that's kind of the problem, and that's been the problem with our trains and planes and automobiles [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=620.56s)]
*  for a century now. Too many white people in them. Got a lot of white airline pilots. That's the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=626.0s)]
*  problem. Mayor Pete just said that. Doesn't have to be this way. That's equity. So this is where [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=630.96s)]
*  your $1.2 trillion is going to what is, I mean, not to get technical, an illegal campaign to hire [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=636.72s)]
*  workers on the basis of their skin color. So Mayor Pete, you may have noticed, is the wrong skin color, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=643.2s)]
*  and as long as you want to diversify and equify transportation, why is he running the department? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=649.36s)]
*  Because he's too important to give up his job to an unqualified Haitian migrant. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  That's because Mayor Pete can see the big picture. He understands that every transportation decision [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=660.8s)]
*  is in fact something so much bigger. Let me take 50 seconds to walk through our top priorities, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=665.28s)]
*  and then let's just jump into the conversation. So our focus is on safety, of course. That's why [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=673.76s)]
*  our department exists. It is on economic development and the ways of good infrastructure create jobs. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=678.56s)]
*  It is on equity in the knowledge that we can either do harm or do enormous good in terms of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=684.4s)]
*  who gets the opportunities we create and where they go. It is about climate, recognizing that [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=691.52s)]
*  every transportation decision is a climate decision, whether we acknowledge that or not. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=697.12s)]
*  We couldn't understand everything he said because for some reason he had a freaking mask on his face. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=703.6s)]
*  Maybe he was robbing a train. Not clear. We've got a reporter getting to the bottom of that, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=708.08s)]
*  but we think we heard him say that his job is to work on climate. It's funny. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=712.32s)]
*  When the country applauded $1.2 trillion going to fixing the roads, bridges, and buildings, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  a lot of us were dumb enough to think that's what might actually happen. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyC-1Mgrv0U&t=725.0400000000001s)]
