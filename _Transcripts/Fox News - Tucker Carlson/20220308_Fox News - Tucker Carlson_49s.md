# Tucker: DeSantis humiliates reporter for asking this question
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY)
*  Ron DeSantis, humiliated reporter who tried to lie about this bill, watched the exchange. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, I just want to ask you about the recommendation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  ...and education, what critics call the Don't Say Gay Bill is on the Senate floor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=6.8s)]
*  Does it say that in the bill? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=10.64s)]
*  No, that you support... [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=11.88s)]
*  Does it say that in the bill? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm asking you... [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=14.36s)]
*  I'm asking you to tell me what's in the bill because you are pushing false narratives. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=15.36s)]
*  It doesn't matter what critics say. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=19.1s)]
*  Hold on, it says advanced classroom instruction on sexual identity and gender orientation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=20.48s)]
*  For who? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=24.92s)]
*  For grades pre-K through three. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=27.12s)]
*  So five-year-olds, six-year-olds, seven-year-olds. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  And the idea that you wouldn't be honest about that and tell people what it actually says, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  it's why people don't trust people like you because you peddle false narratives. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=38.56s)]
*  They never stop lying, do they? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=42.92s)]
*  Finally someone stands up to them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_38ObHPdLY&t=46.480000000000004s)]
