# Tucker Carlson: Why does Janet Yellen still have her job?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, happy Tuesday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=2.4s)]
*  It was six years ago in one of those semi-hilarious moments [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=3.36s)]
*  that has unfortunately been lost to history [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=6.24s)]
*  that Janet Yellen sat through what must have been [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=8.16s)]
*  the single most uncomfortable congressional hearing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=10.68s)]
*  of her life. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  At the time, you may remember, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Yellen was running the Federal Reserve, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=15.64s)]
*  and she was, as she remains today, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=17.2s)]
*  a lifestyle liberal in good standing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=19.3s)]
*  So put yourself in her position [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=22.14s)]
*  and imagine the shock she must have felt [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=23.72s)]
*  when members of the Congressional Black Caucus suggested [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=26.18s)]
*  that she, Janet Yellen, was in fact a racist, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=28.9s)]
*  maybe even a white supremacist. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=31.86s)]
*  What did Janet Yellen do wrong? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=33.82s)]
*  Well, they suggested what she did wrong [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=35.44s)]
*  was she failed to harness the power of the Federal Reserve [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=37.46s)]
*  to help African-Americans specifically. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  Now, at first, Yellen seemed confused by this complaint. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=44.06s)]
*  The point of the Fed is to keep the American economy stable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  The point is not to pay off loyal blocks [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=49.94s)]
*  of Democratic voters. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=51.78s)]
*  And she tried to explain this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=53.06s)]
*  Our powers, she said, can't be targeted [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  at the experience of particular groups. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=56.66s)]
*  That was her response. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=59.9s)]
*  But the Congressional Black Caucus did not buy it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  Their message to Janet Yellen was the same as their message [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=63.3s)]
*  to you and every other person in this country [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=65.7s)]
*  of 350 million people. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=67.22s)]
*  Do what we say, we will denounce you as a racist. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=68.86s)]
*  And finally, Janet Yellen got that message. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=72.74s)]
*  Boy, did she. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=75.02s)]
*  Within a year, Yellen had all but abandoned [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=75.94s)]
*  the traditional constraints of monetary policy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=78.34s)]
*  Instead, there she was, yammering on in public [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=80.97999999999999s)]
*  about things like racial equity and environmental justice. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=83.78s)]
*  Now, those are issues that, unlike economics, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=88.78s)]
*  cannot be quantified or even specifically defined. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=90.74s)]
*  They are therefore perfect vehicles [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=93.46s)]
*  for power-hungry politicians [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=95.33999999999999s)]
*  hoping to become more powerful. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  Now, Yellen was supposedly an economist, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=99.5s)]
*  but as she turned 70, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=101.94s)]
*  she left the field of economics completely [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  and entered the far more familiar world [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=105.69999999999999s)]
*  of political activism. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=108.02s)]
*  By the time she became Joe Biden's Treasury Secretary, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=110.22s)]
*  the transformation was complete. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=112.5s)]
*  Among Yellen's first acts as Treasury Secretary [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=114.02s)]
*  was an order changing the mission [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=116.94s)]
*  of the Treasury Department's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=119.02s)]
*  Financial Stability Oversight Council. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=120.46s)]
*  Now, that council was created by Congress [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=123.5s)]
*  after the last financial crisis, as its name suggests, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=125.3s)]
*  to prevent something similar from ever happening again. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=128.9s)]
*  And for about a decade, it focused on questions [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=131.98s)]
*  that might prevent another meltdown. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=134.14s)]
*  Questions like subprime lending [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=135.7s)]
*  and automated trading on Wall Street, relevant questions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=137.66s)]
*  But under Janet Yellen, the council turned its attention [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=141.26s)]
*  to a far more fashionable issue [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=143.98s)]
*  that she was consumed with, global warming. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  Quote, we must look ahead at emerging risks, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  Yellen proclaimed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  Climate change is obviously the big one. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=152.5s)]
*  She sent a letter to the World Bank [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=154.94s)]
*  telling them the same thing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=156.14s)]
*  As for inflation, which traditionally was a core concern [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=157.94s)]
*  of government economists, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=160.98s)]
*  that was the emerging risk they were worried about. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=162.1s)]
*  Yellen just shrugged that off. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=164.82s)]
*  Inflation? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=165.78s)]
*  If that happens, she told us in a now famous quote, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=166.94s)]
*  it'll be quote, transitory. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=169.66s)]
*  In the history of bad predictions from Washington, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=172.82s)]
*  which could fill volumes, that might take first place. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=175.34s)]
*  In fact, since Joe Biden became president, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=178.7s)]
*  the price of gasoline has doubled. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=181.38s)]
*  And so have the prices of many other key commodities [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  that Americans need to live. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=185.82s)]
*  And the worst part is that not only did Janet Yellen, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=188.5s)]
*  the treasury secretary, fail to see any of this coming, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=190.82s)]
*  Janet Yellen, more than any other single person in America, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=194.94s)]
*  caused it in the first place [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=198.22s)]
*  through reckless loose money policies [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=199.9s)]
*  implemented during her years at the Fed, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  policies that were bound to cause inflation, and did. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=203.82s)]
*  So if you're mad about the current state of the economy, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=207.42s)]
*  Janet Yellen is probably the first person you should blame. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=209.62s)]
*  Why does she still have her job? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=211.9s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=213.66s)]
*  And we might've heard an answer to that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=215.14s)]
*  because Yellen was back in front of Congress today, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=216.34s)]
*  but this time there were no tough interrogatories [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=218.1s)]
*  from the Congressional Black Caucus. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=221.06s)]
*  No one called her a racist. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=222.26s)]
*  Instead they kissed up to her. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=224.66s)]
*  As Yellen explained to a deeply sympathetic room [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=226.38s)]
*  of members of Congress, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=229.18s)]
*  the real problem with the American economy [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=230.06s)]
*  is that she and the Democratic Party [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=232.5s)]
*  don't yet have enough control over it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=234.46s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=236.9s)]
*  Look, over the medium term, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=237.74s)]
*  the critical thing is that we become more dependent [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=239.94s)]
*  on the wind and the sun that are not subject [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=243.66s)]
*  to geopolitical influences and passing clean energy credits [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=247.18s)]
*  that will boost non-renewables [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=253.18s)]
*  is I think really, really critical [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=258.62s)]
*  to addressing climate change [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=261.66s)]
*  and our energy costs for households. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=266.82s)]
*  Well, Madam Secretary, might. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=270.22s)]
*  So just for fun, if you have five minutes, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  rewind the tape, transcribe what she just said, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=274.94s)]
*  and see if you can make sense of the verbal bully base. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=278.22s)]
*  What are you looking at? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=282.7s)]
*  It's called intersectionalism. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  It's the new religion of government. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=284.94s)]
*  And it allows bureaucrats when it becomes clear [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  they have no idea what they're doing, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  to just pivot and talk about something [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=291.06s)]
*  they know even less about. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=292.94s)]
*  So here you have Janet Yellen talking about [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=295.38s)]
*  geopolitical influences, clean energy credits, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=297.62s)]
*  climate change. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=300.41999999999996s)]
*  What is Janet Yellen talking about? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=301.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, she has no idea. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=304.26s)]
*  The problem is that there are people out there [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=306.17999999999995s)]
*  who actually do understand what she's trying to talk about. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=307.7s)]
*  Experts, actual experts, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=310.62s)]
*  have studied the sustainability of renewable energy [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=312.14s)]
*  for years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=314.58s)]
*  Michael Schellenberger, for example, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=315.62s)]
*  found that from 2011 to 2017, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=316.94s)]
*  the cost of solar panels dropped [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=319.7s)]
*  by more than 70% in this country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=321.65999999999997s)]
*  There were more of them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=323.5s)]
*  It's a supply and demand question. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=324.34s)]
*  But here's the interesting part. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=325.86s)]
*  During that same period as the cost of solar panels fell, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=327.29999999999995s)]
*  electricity prices in California went up five times more [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=330.62s)]
*  than they did in the rest of the United States. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=334.58s)]
*  Why more solar panels? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=336.18s)]
*  The solar panels were cheaper, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=337.58s)]
*  but the electricity they produced was more expensive. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=338.7s)]
*  Huh? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=340.9s)]
*  How does that work and how's it helping you? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=342.18s)]
*  We know it happens because it happened in Germany at scale. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=344.06s)]
*  From 2006 to 2018, that would be the heyday, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=348.14s)]
*  the peak years of Germany's big renewable energy push, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=351.74s)]
*  electricity prices went up 50%. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=355.14s)]
*  Now, why'd that happen? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=359.46s)]
*  Well, let's compare it to a neighboring country. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  In France, electricity prices were much lower than Germany's, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=363.46s)]
*  even though France gets twice as much of its energy [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=367.82s)]
*  from clean energy sources as Germany does. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=370.7s)]
*  What? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=374.46s)]
*  What made France so special? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=375.29999999999995s)]
*  How'd they pull that off? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=376.82s)]
*  Simple, nuclear. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=378.38s)]
*  France gets a lot of its energy from nuclear power. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=380.34s)]
*  Janet Yellen does not consider nuclear power a renewable. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=383.29999999999995s)]
*  When she says renewable, she means wind and solar, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=387.02s)]
*  which by definition are not reliable sources of energy, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=389.97999999999996s)]
*  but they are, and this is always the key, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=392.5s)]
*  highly profitable to democratic donors [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=394.09999999999997s)]
*  and the government of China. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=396.58s)]
*  So of course, Janet Yellen is for them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  Of course, Yellen didn't go into details [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=400.74s)]
*  on why she thinks what she does, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=402.38s)]
*  because if you unpack it, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=403.58s)]
*  if you slow down and speak clearly, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=405.58s)]
*  it doesn't make any sense. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=408.02s)]
*  And Janet Yellen knows that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=410.74s)]
*  She's an activist. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  She gets that logic is irrelevant. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=413.14s)]
*  Thinking clearly? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=416.14s)]
*  No, that gets you nowhere. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=417.5s)]
*  Emotion is what carries the day. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=419.34s)]
*  And that's why during today's congressional hearings, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=422.41999999999996s)]
*  she started talking about yet another topic [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=424.94s)]
*  she knows nothing about, gun crime. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=427.14s)]
*  I am also horrified by gun violence, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=430.98s)]
*  what we've seen in recent weeks over and over many years. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=435.06s)]
*  And I do hope that Congress will take long overdue action [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=439.5s)]
*  and put in place common sense measures [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=445.34s)]
*  to reduce gun violence. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=449.98s)]
*  Oh, I'm horrified by gun violence. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=452.3s)]
*  I'm sorry, ma'am, you're the treasury secretary? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=455.38000000000005s)]
*  Let's talk about the economy, which is imploding. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=459.1s)]
*  Stop with your little abortion talk, your little gun talk, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=462.1s)]
*  not your area. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=465.02000000000004s)]
*  Let's get back into your lane. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=466.38000000000005s)]
*  You're the treasury secretary. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=468.58000000000004s)]
*  But of course she doesn't want to. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=471.54s)]
*  The goal always is to talk about anything [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=472.86s)]
*  other than the economy. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=475.26000000000005s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=476.3s)]
*  Because they destroyed the economy. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=477.12s)]
*  But there was one exception. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=478.5s)]
*  At one point, Janet Yellen was asked, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=480.34000000000003s)]
*  because it's a pretty obvious question, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=482.66s)]
*  how exactly, as the treasury secretary [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=484.02s)]
*  and former Fed chair, as an economist and a genius, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=486.02s)]
*  how'd you miss the inflation you caused? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=490.14s)]
*  Here it went. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=492.7s)]
*  I said that inflation would be transitory. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=494.34s)]
*  What I was not anticipating was a scenario [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=497.09999999999997s)]
*  in which we would end up contending [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=501.14s)]
*  with multiple variants of COVID [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=504.38s)]
*  that would be scrambling our economy [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=507.5s)]
*  and global supply chains. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=510.46s)]
*  And I was not envisioning [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=512.62s)]
*  impacts on food and energy prices we've seen [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=517.1s)]
*  from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=520.7800000000001s)]
*  So as Chair Powell indicated himself, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=523.58s)]
*  both of us probably could have used [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=528.26s)]
*  a better term than transitory. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=530.5s)]
*  I do expect inflation to remain high, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=533.4200000000001s)]
*  although I very much hope that it will be coming down now. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=537.0200000000001s)]
*  So you didn't see COVID coming, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=542.94s)]
*  even though it was here for two years [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=545.5400000000001s)]
*  and we shut down the entire economy [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=547.5s)]
*  and then made up for the gap in productivity [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=549.62s)]
*  with profligate government spending [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=551.82s)]
*  where we just printed trillions of fake dollars. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=553.5s)]
*  But you didn't think that was gonna cause inflation somehow? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=556.7800000000001s)]
*  And you didn't think a war in the breadbasket of Europe [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=560.1s)]
*  would affect food prices? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=563.5s)]
*  Let's say you were a talk show host on a cable channel [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=565.4200000000001s)]
*  with no economic experience whatsoever [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=567.7s)]
*  or even the ability to balance a checkbook [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=569.74s)]
*  and it was obvious to you, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=571.66s)]
*  but you're the treasury secretary [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=573.86s)]
*  but you didn't see it coming? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=575.62s)]
*  Maybe you shouldn't have called it transitory? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=577.1s)]
*  And your answer is, and we're quoting, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=579.62s)]
*  I do expect inflation to remain high, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=581.58s)]
*  although I do very much hope it will be coming down. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=583.62s)]
*  Oh, you very much hope. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=587.34s)]
*  Is that where we are? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=588.5s)]
*  We are very much hoping? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=589.46s)]
*  Tell us more about abortion and gun violence if you would. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=591.5s)]
*  Blame COVID and Putin and call it a day. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=595.38s)]
*  This is a joke. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=598.98s)]
*  Fox's Hillary Vaughn, to her credit, was not convinced. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=600.7s)]
*  She asked Janet Yellen whether Joe Biden's decision [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=603.6600000000001s)]
*  to spend trillions of dollars [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=606.1400000000001s)]
*  might have contributed to inflation [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=607.74s)]
*  because when you have more of something, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=609.5400000000001s)]
*  it's worth less, like your currency, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=610.6600000000001s)]
*  which is almost worth less. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=613.34s)]
*  And here was Janet Yellen's response. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=615.1400000000001s)]
*  Do you ever warn the White House [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=617.1400000000001s)]
*  that increased government spending [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=619.0600000000001s)]
*  could have contributed to the inflation [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=621.3000000000001s)]
*  that we're seeing today? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=623.0200000000001s)]
*  Oh, go away, peasant troll, your inflation talk. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=624.26s)]
*  I'm worried about climate change [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=629.74s)]
*  and gun violence and abortion. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=631.26s)]
*  Leave me alone. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=632.9399999999999s)]
*  It's not like the Treasury Secretary, be gone. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=633.78s)]
*  She should be gone. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=637.38s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=639.02s)]
*  And in a functioning country, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=640.78s)]
*  Janet Yellen would be in a retirement home somewhere [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=642.22s)]
*  writing her memoirs that no one would ever read. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=644.74s)]
*  But that's not what's happening. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=648.1s)]
*  She's still the Treasury Secretary. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=649.34s)]
*  But that's not what's happening. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=651.94s)]
*  She's still the Treasury Secretary, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=653.1800000000001s)]
*  and that's not what happened today. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=654.9000000000001s)]
*  Instead, Democrats took turns bragging [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=656.82s)]
*  about their expensive electric cars. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=659.3000000000001s)]
*  Worrying about gas prices? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=660.94s)]
*  Just get a Tesla, baby. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=662.5s)]
*  Here's Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=665.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, good morning, Madam Secretary. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=668.86s)]
*  We're so glad to have you with us. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=670.26s)]
*  I do have to say, just on the issue of gas prices, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=672.6600000000001s)]
*  after waiting for a long time [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=676.34s)]
*  to have enough chips in this country [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  to finally get my electric vehicle, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=679.86s)]
*  I got it and drove it from Michigan to here [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=682.02s)]
*  this last weekend and went by every single gas station [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=686.3000000000001s)]
*  and didn't matter how high it was. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=689.62s)]
*  And so I'm looking forward to the opportunity [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=691.02s)]
*  for us to move to vehicles that aren't going to be [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=693.38s)]
*  dependent on the whims of the oil companies [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=695.9s)]
*  and the international markets. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=700.1s)]
*  Yes, because electric cars don't actually use energy, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=704.46s)]
*  so they're disconnected from the international market. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=708.42s)]
*  Hey, Debbie Stabenow, what's an international market? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=710.38s)]
*  Do you have any idea whatsoever? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=712.06s)]
*  Do you know anything? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=714.0999999999999s)]
*  You're telling us that the oil companies are so greedy, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=715.78s)]
*  they somehow canceled their own leases for drilling. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=719.18s)]
*  They're so greedy, they don't even want to drill oil, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=721.9399999999999s)]
*  and that's why they shut down their own pipelines. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=724.2199999999999s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=726.3s)]
*  And that's why they're talking about implementing a gas tax, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=727.38s)]
*  because they don't want you to use oil, right? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=730.54s)]
*  What's the reasoning here, Debbie Stabenow? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=735.86s)]
*  Maybe we should contact Janet Yellen. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=737.78s)]
*  Maybe she'll answer, maybe she'll just wave us away [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=740.3s)]
*  like the peasants we are. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=742.54s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=744.86s)]
*  How can this person be our Treasury Secretary? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=745.82s)]
*  We're in deep waters. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=747.74s)]
*  Is there anyone who can pull us out of them? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Gn2dm0zSA&t=748.94s)]
