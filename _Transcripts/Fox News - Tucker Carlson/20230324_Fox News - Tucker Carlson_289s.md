# Tucker: Why are we allowing this?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs)
*  So the Biden administration has made a practice now for over two years of picking federal judges [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=0.0s)]
*  based on the way they look, based instead of their competence. And the confirmation hearings [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=5.76s)]
*  for these judges are as painful as you would expect they would be. Contagi Brown Jackson [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=12.72s)]
*  famously said she can't define a woman and yet she's somehow in the Supreme Court. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=18.96s)]
*  Another judicial nominee in Washington state couldn't explain what Article 2 of the Constitution [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=23.44s)]
*  is. Wants to be a federal judge. Then there's the latest, a guy called Cato Cruz. It's Biden's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=28.88s)]
*  nominee to a federal judgeship. How did he do in the hearings? Well, here's a clip. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=35.28s)]
*  Tell me how you analyze a Brady motion. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  How I analyze a Brady motion? Yes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=46.56s)]
*  Senator, in my four and a half years on the bench, I'm not, don't believe I've had the occasion to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=51.28s)]
*  address a Brady motion in my career. Do you know what a Brady motion is? Senator, in my time on [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=57.68s)]
*  the bench, I've not had occasion to address that and so it's not coming to mind at the moment what [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=65.44s)]
*  a Brady motion is. Right. He later guessed it must have something to do with gun control because [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=70.0s)]
*  President Reagan's press secretary was called Brady and he got shot and his wife became a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=76.88s)]
*  gun control advocate. Right. So this is not a small question to miss. The Brady that Senator [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=80.48s)]
*  Kennedy referred to emanates from the Supreme Court case that requires government to turn over [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=86.4s)]
*  exculpatory evidence to the defense. That's the core of our justice system. By the way, that's the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  rule that DOJ violated in hundreds of cases of January 6th defendants. This guy who wants to be [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=96.48s)]
*  a federal judge had no clue what it was. That's a deal-ender right there. No, you can't be a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  federal judge. Sorry. Go do something useful with your life. You can't be a judge. You probably will [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  be. Ned Ryan is the CEO of American Majority. He joins us tonight. Ned Ryan, thanks so much. I don't [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=114.24s)]
*  know what is going on but when they start, look it's fine if you have flaky sociology professors or [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  administrators at Stanford or whatever, who cares? But airline pilots, heart surgeons, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=124.88s)]
*  and federal judges, why are we allowing this? Well, I think this is the entire point for [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=128.88s)]
*  progressives. I mean you have a judge that doesn't know Article 2 or Article 5 of the Constitution. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=135.44s)]
*  This gentleman that doesn't know the Brady motion, the Brady rule, again as you pointed out, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=140.72s)]
*  where hundreds if not thousands of Americans are being denied this basic right because of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=145.2s)]
*  their political views. Well, there are a couple things going on here, Tucker. First, they are [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=150.16s)]
*  diversity hires. They're hoping to skate by on their skin or gender or sexual preferences. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=154.64s)]
*  But it really does highlight that the Biden administration, whoever's actually running it, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=159.2s)]
*  is putting up activists masquerading as judges because the whole point is to get more votes to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=163.6s)]
*  rubber stamp the left's social and political agenda. But even more so, Tucker, as you think [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=168.56s)]
*  about progressives, they've always viewed the Constitution and the law as obstacles to be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=174.24s)]
*  avoided but even more so maybe dismantled. So why would you even bother knowing about it? Because [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=179.28s)]
*  you're not going to pay attention to them anyway. And the whole point of progressivism from day one [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  until today is to dismantle the original intent of the Constitution, separation of powers, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=188.4s)]
*  and all these other things that were put in place by our founders. They don't care about them. They [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=194.0s)]
*  don't want them. So why should you bother with them? Because you're never going to implement them [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=198.24s)]
*  because they're more a series of suggestions that you're trying to avoid. Well, here's why. Because [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  if you don't have the rule of law and equal application of the law, you don't have civil [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=206.96s)]
*  rights. And I thought they were for civil rights. So I don't know why people like Lindsey Graham vote [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=211.28s)]
*  to confirm judges who don't know anything about the Constitution. Like, what is this? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=216.4s)]
*  Because from the very beginning, progressive statists have been the enemy of basic civil rights, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=222.0s)]
*  of the rule of law, of property rights, of all these things. And over the last 100 years, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=229.84s)]
*  it's like their colors are coming out more and more and it's getting harder and harder to hide [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=234.0s)]
*  that. But this has been the whole point of progressivism from day one, Tucker. They have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=237.36s)]
*  no intention of any of these basic rights. Their goal is the administrative state and, quite frankly, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=241.36s)]
*  ultimately, it's power, authoritarianism. And so the Constitution and the law are to be disregarded. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=246.96s)]
*  They will make of them whatever they want them to be to achieve whatever they want. The point is not [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  the original intent of the Constitution. The goal is not the rule of law. It's whatever they can make [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=259.92s)]
*  them to be to achieve what they want. And here we are. We're so mesmerized by watching them tear [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=264.64s)]
*  down our institutions. We don't think enough about what they're going to replace them with. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=269.36s)]
*  And we should. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  Authoritarianism. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=273.76s)]
*  Ned Ryan. Exactly. Thank you so much. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=274.32s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-XLVEzkKs&t=277.44s)]
