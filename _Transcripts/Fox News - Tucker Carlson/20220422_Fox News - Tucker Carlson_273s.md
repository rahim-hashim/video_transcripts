# DeSantis responds to critics after signing bill ending Disney autonomy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs)
*  But here are the new rules. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=0.0s)]
*  If you would like a big publicly held corporation [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=1.6s)]
*  to pay its taxes, then you're a child rapist. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=4.94s)]
*  Obviously you're a racist. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=8.64s)]
*  You're like Putin, which means you're a fascist. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=10.14s)]
*  But you know what else you are? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=11.98s)]
*  According to Joy Reid, you're a communist. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=13.58s)]
*  Ron DeSantis is, quote, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=16.82s)]
*  taking us back to the Soviet Union. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=17.98s)]
*  You're a communist, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=19.76s)]
*  if you want the company to pay its taxes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Now Joy Reid went to Harvard, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=23.1s)]
*  so we're not gonna disagree with her. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=24.46s)]
*  But we did feel a moral obligation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=25.86s)]
*  to check that fact, because it's a heavy claim. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=27.36s)]
*  So joining us tonight to confirm or deny these charters [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  is comrade Ron DeSantis, who is also the governor of Florida. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=32.14s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=35.54s)]
*  So I can't tell whether you're a racist, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=37.58s)]
*  a communist, a fascist, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=40.34s)]
*  for wanting a big publicly held corporation [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  to pay its taxes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=44.38s)]
*  How would you describe yourself? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=45.32s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, Tucker. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=48.68s)]
*  Not only pay taxes, I mean, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=49.66s)]
*  this company had a deal, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=51.32s)]
*  unlike any company or any individual [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  in all of the state of Florida, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=56.46s)]
*  and probably anywhere in the United States, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=57.82s)]
*  they were self-governing, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  they had extraordinary powers, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=61.16s)]
*  they could build nuclear power plants, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=62.96s)]
*  they didn't have to go through permitting processes, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=65.0s)]
*  obviously a lot of tax benefits. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=67.2s)]
*  And so that's just inappropriate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=68.8s)]
*  And it's certainly inappropriate when you look, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=70.6s)]
*  as you, I think, did a great job pointing out, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=72.74s)]
*  they pledged themselves to mobilize [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=75.1s)]
*  their considerable corporate resources [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=77.8s)]
*  out of the coffers of this Burbank, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=80.34s)]
*  California-based corporation, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=82.24s)]
*  to overturn the rights of parents [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=84.38s)]
*  in the state of Florida, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=86.94s)]
*  and effectively commandeer our democratic process. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=87.94s)]
*  And so that obviously is something [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  that we very much objected to. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=93.16s)]
*  And then you also have those videos that you showed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=95.22s)]
*  where you have all these higher-ups in Disney [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  talking about how it was their intent [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=100.02s)]
*  to inject sexuality in the programming [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=102.62s)]
*  that goes to young kids. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=105.16s)]
*  I got a five-year-old, a four-year-old, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=106.2s)]
*  and a two-year-old at home, Tucker. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=107.66s)]
*  I want them to be able to watch cartoons [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  without having this stuff jammed down their throats. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=111.44s)]
*  And so it was appropriate to have done this originally, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=114.06s)]
*  three years ago, whatever, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  but it's certainly appropriate to make them live [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=119.56s)]
*  under the same laws as everybody else [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  in the state of Florida. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=124.14s)]
*  Well, yes, and it's a little weird coming from people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=125.2s)]
*  who devote their programming to defending, quote, democracy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=127.14s)]
*  So you've been elected by the voters of Florida. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=131.24s)]
*  You're standing for election very soon in November, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=133.82s)]
*  and we'll see how you do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=136.28s)]
*  But you're a product of democracy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=137.78s)]
*  Bob Chapik and Bob Iger were elected by nobody, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=139.76s)]
*  so why wouldn't democracy defenders be on the side [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  of the legislative process over corporate fiat? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  Because I think what the left has come to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=149.6s)]
*  is all they want to see is power exercised [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=151.4s)]
*  in advance of their leftist agenda. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=154.26s)]
*  So yes, they used to be hostile to big corporations [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=156.24s)]
*  because I think they perceived those corporations [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=158.96s)]
*  as being apolitical [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=161.4s)]
*  and that they wouldn't support their agenda. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=162.78s)]
*  Now they figured out that they can try to subcontract out [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=164.5s)]
*  their leftism to some of these big corporations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=168.02s)]
*  and some of the executives will cave to the woke mob [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=170.86s)]
*  and then they'll basically do the left's dirty work. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=174.26s)]
*  Tucker, they're not gonna win elections in Florida [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=176.36s)]
*  if they're actually running on injecting transgender ideology [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=178.62s)]
*  into second grade classrooms, and they know that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=182.5s)]
*  So their hope was getting Disney involved in that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=184.36s)]
*  would somehow get me to back down from signing the bill. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=187.34s)]
*  Well, that was a bad judgment in their part [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=191.04s)]
*  because of course we weren't gonna back down an inch. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=194.04s)]
*  It's a little weird [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=196.56s)]
*  because there are a bunch of Republican governors [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=197.4s)]
*  in the country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=199.04s)]
*  There's actually a Republican governor [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=199.88s)]
*  that sits over one of the most evenly divided states. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=200.72s)]
*  It's a Republican state, but just barely. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Overwhelmingly Republican states in the West, like Utah, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=205.04s)]
*  their governors have done nothing like this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=208.92s)]
*  They haven't fought back at all. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=210.6s)]
*  Why is that, do you think? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=211.64s)]
*  You know, I don't know, Tucker. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=215.44s)]
*  I mean, I think the way I view it is, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=216.32s)]
*  is you have the media class, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=218.0s)]
*  you have kind of the Twitter class, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  you have some of these people [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=221.88s)]
*  and that's a distorted view of reality. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=223.44s)]
*  And you actually need to talk to people [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=225.92s)]
*  who aren't always on those outlets [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=228.04s)]
*  and listen to what they have to say. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  And I can tell you, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=232.4s)]
*  they do not want this woke garbage in our society. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  They don't want women to be denied the opportunity [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=236.88s)]
*  to participate in sports. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=239.44s)]
*  They don't want to see their kids go to kindergarten [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=241.16s)]
*  and have this stuff jammed down their throats. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=244.28s)]
*  And so I just stand with the people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=246.04s)]
*  I stand against a lot of media [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=248.2s)]
*  and a lot of big corporations. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=249.6s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think we have the facts [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=251.14s)]
*  and the strength in numbers on our side. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=253.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're exactly right. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=256.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=258.32s)]
*  It was great to see you tonight. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=259.14s)]
*  Governor DeSantis of Florida. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ZgrIt2KUs&t=259.98s)]
