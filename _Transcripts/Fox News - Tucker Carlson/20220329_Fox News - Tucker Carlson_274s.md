# Gov. Ron DeSantis responds to leaked Disney comments about parental rights bill
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8)
*  Ron DeSantis is the governor of the state of Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=0.0s)]
*  We're delighted to have him join us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=2.48s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=3.68s)]
*  I have to say, you're one of the only politicians [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=5.24s)]
*  I've ever seen, and so many Republican governors [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=6.8s)]
*  in red states really are some of the weakest people [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=8.96s)]
*  in the country, have caved. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=10.72s)]
*  You have not caved. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  You've really tried to explain what this bill's about. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=13.06s)]
*  If you'll just do it quickly for us once again, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=14.76s)]
*  what is this bill? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=16.6s)]
*  Well, this bill is about providing protection [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  so that they know they can send their young kids to school [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=21.48s)]
*  without them being sexualized, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=24.32s)]
*  without a school telling a young girl, for example, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=26.2s)]
*  that she may really be a boy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=29.76s)]
*  And if schools are trying to do things that impact [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=31.6s)]
*  the health and wellbeing of the kids [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=35.0s)]
*  and they're undertaking certain services, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  that parents have a right to know that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  and provide consent for it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=40.88s)]
*  So this is a real bill that empowers parents, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  it protects our kids, and for a company like Disney [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=44.96s)]
*  to say that this bill should have never passed, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=48.64s)]
*  first of all, Tucker, they weren't saying anything [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  when this was going through the House. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=52.96s)]
*  They only started doing this because the mob, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=54.540000000000006s)]
*  the woke mob came after them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  So put that aside. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=58.44s)]
*  For them to say that them as a California-based company [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=59.8s)]
*  are gonna work to take those California values [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=64.08s)]
*  and overturn a law that was duly enacted [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  and as you said, supported by a strong majority [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=71.12s)]
*  of Floridians, they don't run this state. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=73.86s)]
*  They will never run this state as long as I'm governor. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=77.0s)]
*  Yeah, they haven't improved Orlando, I noticed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=79.9s)]
*  Why don't they throw some money into downtown Orlando [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=81.62s)]
*  and help the people who live there? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=83.44s)]
*  I have to ask you this, since you're on the topic of Disney, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=84.56s)]
*  journalist Chris Ruffo, who's really done a lot, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=87.04s)]
*  has just obtained a video of an all-hands meeting at Disney. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=89.04s)]
*  The meeting was in response to the legislation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=91.68s)]
*  you signed in Florida. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=94.26s)]
*  Here is Disney corporate president, Carrie Burke. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm here as a mother of two queer children, actually. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=100.68s)]
*  One transgender child and one pansexual child [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=105.92s)]
*  and also as a leader. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=114.08s)]
*  and yet we don't have enough leads [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=119.08s)]
*  and narratives in which gay characters [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=124.88s)]
*  just get to be characters [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=127.56s)]
*  and not have to be about gay stories. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=130.92s)]
*  So I don't understand why an entertainment company [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=136.12s)]
*  that makes animated movies gets to control legislation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=139.56s)]
*  in your state. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=142.6s)]
*  One especially, Tucker, you gotta wonder, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=145.08s)]
*  why is the hill to die on to have transgenderism [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=147.84s)]
*  injected into kindergarten classrooms [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=151.72000000000003s)]
*  or woke gender ideology injected [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  into second grade classroom? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  Why is that the hill to die on? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, if we had done a bill that prohibited [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=159.5s)]
*  talking about the abuse of Uyghurs in China, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=163.28s)]
*  Disney would have supported that legislation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=166.36s)]
*  because they don't wanna say a word about that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  So it's just an odd manifestation of their corporate values [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=170.24s)]
*  that they actually do Disney cruises, Tucker, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  to the nation of Dominica, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=177.34s)]
*  which criminalizes homosexuality. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  So they're fine doing that and lining their pockets. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=181.8s)]
*  They're fine lining their pockets from the CCP [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  and all the atrocities that go on there, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  but it's those kindergartners in Florida [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  that they really want to have transgenderism [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  as part of their core curriculum in school. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=195.8s)]
*  And talking to kids about their genitals, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=198.32s)]
*  like I thought that was, I'm not a lawyer, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=200.4s)]
*  I thought that would be a crime, right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=202.0s)]
*  No, it should be. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=203.62s)]
*  Tucker, I mean, I think about when I was in school, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=206.76s)]
*  we just did schoolwork. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=209.04s)]
*  We did things like math and science and reading. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=210.84s)]
*  I don't even know how this would become fodder [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=214.1s)]
*  for a second grade classroom. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=216.72s)]
*  And so the fact that they're going to this lengths [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=219.12s)]
*  to try to torpedo legislation that I think 90% of parents [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=221.32s)]
*  probably view as just common sense, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=225.22s)]
*  it really makes you wonder [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=227.32s)]
*  about what's motivating this decision-making. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=229.04s)]
*  It really does. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=231.2s)]
*  And just to be clear, final question. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=232.04s)]
*  I read the bill, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  it doesn't say anything about gay marriage, does it? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Is it not an anti-gay marriage bill? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  Tucker, Tucker, the word gay is not in the legislation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=239.4s)]
*  So they say it's banning a word [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=243.56s)]
*  that literally isn't even in the legislation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=245.16s)]
*  It's not even like they're misrepresenting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  the way the words used. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=249.2s)]
*  It's not even used in the bill. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=250.2s)]
*  It's a fake narrative, it's a lie, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=252.0s)]
*  but it's a lie because they have to lie [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  because if they admitted what they were really for, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=256.16s)]
*  sexualizing kindergartners and first graders, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=258.36s)]
*  they know that would not fly with the public. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=260.92s)]
*  Man, you've got a lot of way of us to do this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  and I appreciate it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  And I hope all the other cowards sitting in governor's offices [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=265.8s)]
*  around the country watch this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=270.88000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCJc2xDlm8&t=273.36s)]
