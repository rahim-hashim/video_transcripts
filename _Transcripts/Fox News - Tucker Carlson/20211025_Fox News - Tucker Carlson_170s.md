# NJ gov candidate Jack Ciattarelli responds to Murphy's comments about lockdown orders
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s)
*  So, Phil Murphy, until a couple years ago, was just some creepy finance guy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=0.0s)]
*  Now he's the king of New Jersey. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=4.5s)]
*  So we had Phil Murphy on at the beginning of Corona and asked him, how do you get the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  right to order all these people around like they're your servants? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=12.06s)]
*  The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' right and shrines their right [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=13.06s)]
*  to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=26.24s)]
*  How do you have the power to do that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  That's above my pay grade, Tucker. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=33.76s)]
*  So I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=35.26s)]
*  Given this, he was an early adopter to fascism. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=40.7s)]
*  There's someone running against him in New Jersey, overwhelmingly a Democratic state, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=43.86s)]
*  but Republicans have won in the past. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=46.7s)]
*  So we're going to talk now to Jack Cittarelli. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=48.4s)]
*  He's running against Phil Murphy for governor of New Jersey, which is this year he joins [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=54.7s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  It was almost 30 years ago that Jim Florio lost in a Democratic state because he just [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  went way too far. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Why do you think you can do the same to this guy? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=63.92s)]
*  Phil Murphy's done the same thing, Tucker. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=69.16s)]
*  He's gone way too far left. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=71.2s)]
*  He's very extreme. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=72.6s)]
*  And a year and a half ago on this very show, as you just told us, he said, the Bill of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  Rights, that's above my pay grade. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=77.7s)]
*  It's not funny. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=80.04s)]
*  But worse than that, he told the highest tax people in the nation, if taxes are your [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=81.2s)]
*  issue, we're probably not your state. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=85.86000000000001s)]
*  He's basically telling New Jerseyans to leave. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=88.06s)]
*  I mean, this guy, and I know it's, I think you've got a million more Democrats than Republicans [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=91.14s)]
*  in the state, but is it your sense that like, there've got to be Democrats who this is just, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=96.62s)]
*  this guy's too much. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=101.30000000000001s)]
*  He's incompetent, he's nasty, and he's just totally authoritarian. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  I mean, do you think you have honestly a shot to win? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=106.42000000000002s)]
*  The majority of Democrats in New Jersey, Tucker, are fiscally conservative and socially moderate, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  and this guy is just way too extreme. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  And so we've won six of the last ten governor races in this state, and no Democratic incumbent [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=119.32s)]
*  governor has been re-elected in more than 40 years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=124.6s)]
*  We're right where we need to be with eight days to go. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=127.36s)]
*  I mean, this guy makes Jim Florio look completely reasonable. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=130.32s)]
*  Are you worried about fraud in New Jersey? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=133.48s)]
*  Maybe a rhetorical question. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=135.76s)]
*  We're voting in person this year, and we've got a great legal team on the ground in those [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=139.10000000000002s)]
*  areas that have been trouble spots in the past, but no, I'm not, and I don't want anybody [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=142.9s)]
*  staying home because they think a Republican can't win or it's rigged. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=146.22000000000003s)]
*  We're very confident in this year's election system, and we're confident to win on November 2nd. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=150.34s)]
*  Jack Cittarelli. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=155.74s)]
*  I don't even know everything you stand for. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=156.74s)]
*  I know you're not this guy Murphy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=158.5s)]
*  He's really loathsome. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  He's just the worst. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=161.46s)]
*  So Godspeed, we're rooting for you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  Jack Cittarelli of New Jersey. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=164.22000000000003s)]
*  Hope you can do it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=167.26000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. We can. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNs8VtZ4s_s&t=168.26s)]
