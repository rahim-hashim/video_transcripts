# Kari Lake tells Tucker what she'll do on day one if elected AZ governor
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0)
*  We're gonna start tonight with Kerry Lake. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=0.0s)]
*  She's running for governor in Arizona. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=1.28s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=3.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=4.16s)]
*  So it's very hard to know if you're not there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=6.28s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=8.64s)]
*  What is your best assessment of it? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=10.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, we've got messed up elections for starters [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=13.16s)]
*  and they've counted a lot of ballots, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=16.8s)]
*  but there's still about a half a million left to be counted. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=18.48s)]
*  And these are primarily hardcore Republican voters, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=20.96s)]
*  people who showed up and brought their ballot [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=24.36s)]
*  in on election day. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  We're starting to get a few of today's numbers trickling in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=28.2s)]
*  and we're getting from some of these drops, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=31.92s)]
*  74% of the vote, 72% of the vote. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=33.96s)]
*  These are heavy duty Republican voters. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=37.76s)]
*  And isn't it convenient that they are the last ballots [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=40.4s)]
*  to be counted? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  They count all the Democrat votes early [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=45.32s)]
*  and the really reliable Republican ballots [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=47.84s)]
*  are the last to be counted. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=51.04s)]
*  So we're less than a point away from our opponent [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=52.8s)]
*  and we think it's going to start turning and turning quickly. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  And we believe we're gonna win with a nice padding actually. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=59.720000000000006s)]
*  So your opponent is the secretary of state. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=65.64s)]
*  She didn't campaign much and she didn't seem [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  like she needed to campaign a lot, she never debated you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=74.28s)]
*  And some are smirking online that, well, of course, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=77.56s)]
*  she was always confident in her victory. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=81.36s)]
*  What's your view of that very common take on the race? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=84.24s)]
*  You're trying to get me to say something [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  that might get me in trouble. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=91.6s)]
*  No, no, I've read 50 people say that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=93.08s)]
*  That means people are so distrustful. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  What they're insinuating is that she knew she could sit back, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  hide in the basement, do nothing and win due to cheating. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=103.52s)]
*  That's what they're insinuating. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=107.36s)]
*  And I understand why they would insinuate that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=108.84s)]
*  because we've had such terrible elections. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=111.08s)]
*  They're run poorly, they're ripe with fraud. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=114.08s)]
*  And we've seen this time and time again [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=118.24s)]
*  and nothing's being done. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=120.56s)]
*  Our elected officials tell us if we dare bring it up, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=121.64s)]
*  we are conspiracy theorists, we're election deniers. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  Darn it, we've got to start bringing this up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=128.56s)]
*  People are fed up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=130.92s)]
*  I was in a Veterans Day parade today [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=131.92s)]
*  and people were shouting out from the side of the road, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=134.04s)]
*  please repair our elections, please count our vote. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=136.4s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=140.44s)]
*  The people of Arizona are fed up. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=141.76s)]
*  And when we win, and rest assured, we will, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  with 100% certainty, we will win. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=147.0s)]
*  One of the first things I'm gonna do on day one [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=149.2s)]
*  is call a special session, bring the legislature in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=151.12s)]
*  and say, fix these elections and restore honesty [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=154.16s)]
*  and transparency so we can have faith [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=157.04s)]
*  in our elections once again. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=159.72s)]
*  This is our sacred vote. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=161.04s)]
*  We get one vote. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=162.48s)]
*  That's what we should get, one vote. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=163.72s)]
*  And we wanna know it counted. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=165.32s)]
*  I'm not accusing your opponent of doing anything wrong. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=167.92s)]
*  I have no knowledge of that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=170.48s)]
*  But she is the secretary of state [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=172.6s)]
*  and it seems that one of the main costs [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=174.44s)]
*  of an election this chaotic is the confidence [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=177.28s)]
*  of voters that it's real. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  So why wouldn't she recuse herself for appearance sake, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=181.96s)]
*  if no other, before the count began? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=185.16s)]
*  We asked her to do that one month [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=189.56s)]
*  into jumping into the race back in July of 21. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=191.24s)]
*  We asked her to recuse herself. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=194.68s)]
*  We said, this is unethical. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=196.32s)]
*  Just recuse yourself from the parts of your role [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=198.28s)]
*  as secretary of state that deal with the election [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=201.04s)]
*  and she refused to do so. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=204.68s)]
*  But she only showed up for work 19 days [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=206.6s)]
*  in the past six months. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=209.24s)]
*  So I don't know how much work she does. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=210.76s)]
*  And we had the big red flag on August 2nd, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=213.44s)]
*  the primary election. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=216.48s)]
*  It played out exactly like this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=217.6s)]
*  They counted the Democrat votes first. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=219.96s)]
*  They slow rolled the Republican votes [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=221.84s)]
*  and it was days and days and days of counting. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=224.32s)]
*  They did nothing to improve it before this general election. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=227.68s)]
*  And then we have the tabulator machines that didn't work [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=230.8s)]
*  in a third of the polling places. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  We can't continue to run elections this way. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=235.8s)]
*  We're very confident Tucker, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=238.4s)]
*  that these elections are gonna start, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  or these counts are gonna start going heavily our way [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=241.4s)]
*  and we will win this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=244.4s)]
*  And I assure the people of Arizona, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  we will clean up our elections. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and my view is eliminate absentee ballots [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  except for the tiny percentage who really need them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=252.44s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=255.44s)]
*  And it really is hurting people's view of democracy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=256.64s)]
*  Carrie Lake, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=259.08s)]
*  Best of luck. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=261.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUm9YAsXW0&t=262.76s)]
