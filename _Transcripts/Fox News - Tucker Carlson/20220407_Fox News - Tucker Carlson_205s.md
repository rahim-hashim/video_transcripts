# Crime is out of control in Lightfoot's Chicago: Alderman
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw)
*  Alderman Raymond Lopez, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, we're not particularly partisan. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=3.0s)]
*  You're a Democrat. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=5.0s)]
*  I don't even know what you think on a lot of issues, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=6.0s)]
*  but I know that you care about the people of the city of Chicago, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=8.0s)]
*  so we're thrilled to learn that you're running for mayor. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=11.0s)]
*  What are you going to do if you win? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=14.0s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=17.0s)]
*  You know, I believe in the greatness that is Chicago, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=18.0s)]
*  but clearly this is not the Chicago that I grew up in. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=21.0s)]
*  You know, I did not grow up in a city that coddles criminals, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=24.0s)]
*  that enables bad behavior, and turns a blind eye to the plight of victims in our city. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=27.0s)]
*  That is Lori Lightfoot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=32.0s)]
*  As mayor, I will provide a different direction, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=34.0s)]
*  a sense of leadership and purpose to the city of Chicago that it hasn't seen in a while. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=37.0s)]
*  You know, you have to support first responders. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=42.0s)]
*  You have to support our police trying to maintain law and order. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=44.0s)]
*  You have to rebuild and grow an economy by expanding opportunities [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=47.0s)]
*  and allowing businesses to flourish [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=52.0s)]
*  and not just operating on a handout-driven society. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=54.0s)]
*  And you need to provide the basics of city services to make sure people, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=58.0s)]
*  regardless of the neighborhood they live in, have the services that their taxpayers provide. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=61.0s)]
*  It's pretty simple when you think about it, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=65.0s)]
*  but clearly some people, like the current mayor, have a problem executing that plan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=67.0s)]
*  I will not. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=72.0s)]
*  Well, it is pretty simple, actually. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=74.0s)]
*  Just, like, try not to wreck the lives of your people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=76.0s)]
*  It's, I think. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=79.0s)]
*  Do no harm is not a hard thing to do. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=81.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=83.0s)]
*  So, but Lori Lightfoot did get elected, and Chicago is not some backwater. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=84.0s)]
*  It's one of our biggest cities, a very serious place, a lot of smart people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=88.0s)]
*  So I'm not quite sure how she got elected, but do you think that you can beat her? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=91.0s)]
*  I know that I can beat Lori Lightfoot. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=96.0s)]
*  We have done polls that show that the general population, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=99.0s)]
*  the voters of the city of Chicago, have made a decision on whether or not she deserves a second term, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=102.0s)]
*  and overwhelmingly that answer is no. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=107.0s)]
*  People in Chicago want to feel safe. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=110.0s)]
*  The number one issue in the city of Chicago, as your series pointed out, is that crime is out of control. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=112.0s)]
*  It is like the Wild West in the Midwest in this city. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=118.0s)]
*  They want a mayor who's going to take charge, to take ownership, and I vow to do that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=121.0s)]
*  I will make everyone's personal safety, whether they live here, work here, or come here to visit for vacation, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=126.0s)]
*  my number one priority. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=132.0s)]
*  Mayor Lightfoot has never done that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=134.0s)]
*  We're lucky if she even recognizes a victim, let alone take accountability for it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=136.0s)]
*  I will be accountable for the violence. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=140.0s)]
*  I have stood up to gang bangers throughout my two terms as alderman. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=143.0s)]
*  I have not backed down, even when they've damaged my home, come at me at my house, or even made death threats against me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=147.0s)]
*  They don't scare me the way they scare her, and I will stand for my people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=154.0s)]
*  Yeah. Has she called you racist yet? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=158.0s)]
*  Not yet, but she hasn't actually responded, to be honest, Tucker. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=161.0s)]
*  I'm sure she's trying to figure out how to attack me, because she can't use the LGBT card against me, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=165.0s)]
*  because we're both, she's a lesbian, I'm gay. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=171.0s)]
*  She can't use the minority card, because she's African American, I'm Latino. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=173.0s)]
*  The only thing she has left is to talk about issues, and we know her policies have done more harm than good to the city of Chicago, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=177.0s)]
*  and I welcome that debate. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, all of us who love Chicago from afar are rooting for you to restore order to that great city. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=185.0s)]
*  Alderman Raymond Lopez, joining us tonight. Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=191.0s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacPOmSI0yw&t=193.0s)]
