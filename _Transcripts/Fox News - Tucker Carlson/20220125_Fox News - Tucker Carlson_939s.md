# Tucker: Biden has enabled this ongoing assault
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, a little news alert for you. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=1.68s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi is even more agitated tonight than usual. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=2.96s)]
*  On a conference call just hours ago, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=7.44s)]
*  Pelosi demanded that her members vote immediately [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  on a piece of legislation she says is critical [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=12.0s)]
*  to our national security. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  The bill she's talking about, among other things, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=15.88s)]
*  affirms the central importance of national borders. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=18.2s)]
*  Well, of course it does. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Without a border, you can't have a country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=22.42s)]
*  And Nancy Pelosi firmly believes that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  In fact, she believes it so strongly. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  She's directing the Biden administration [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=28.64s)]
*  to develop an urgent new plan to keep the border secure. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=30.52s)]
*  In fact, not simply secure, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  but in the words of the new legislation, Section 208, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=36.08s)]
*  involuble, meaning impossible to breach, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=38.84s)]
*  walled up and buttoned down, bulletproof. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=42.16s)]
*  That's quite a border. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=44.92s)]
*  But why wouldn't it be? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  When it comes to borders, Nancy Pelosi isn't messing around. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=47.36s)]
*  Are you surprised to hear this? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=50.28s)]
*  Well, you may have misunderstood. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=51.92s)]
*  Pelosi isn't talking about the US border, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=53.64s)]
*  the one that's currently open. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=56.08s)]
*  She's talking about the Ukrainian border, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=57.72s)]
*  the one that actually matters. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=59.48s)]
*  The bill Pelosi is promoting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=61.24s)]
*  is called the Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=62.78s)]
*  Its purpose is to guarantee, quote, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=66.64s)]
*  Ukraine sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=68.44s)]
*  These are the things that all countries need. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=72.4s)]
*  We'd love to have them here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=74.12s)]
*  But no, we're gonna have to wait. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=75.84s)]
*  Ukraine is ahead of us in the queue for secure borders. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=77.68s)]
*  And honestly, you can see why. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=80.44s)]
*  As they used to say when we were kids [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=82.5s)]
*  growing up in the United States, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=83.72s)]
*  what's good for the lightly populated Russian colony [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  of Ukraine is good for us. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=87.34s)]
*  As our oldest and most cherished ally, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=89.78s)]
*  yoked tightly to the American people [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=92.02000000000001s)]
*  by the ancient bonds of friendship, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=93.66s)]
*  shared culture, and Burisma, Ukraine comes first. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=95.62s)]
*  It has to come first. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=99.36s)]
*  When caravans of undocumented Russians [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=100.98s)]
*  appear on the Ukrainian border, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  the United States doesn't sit idly by. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=104.88s)]
*  The United States swoops in with deadly weapons [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  to push these people back. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=109.66s)]
*  We'll send missiles to Ukraine if we have to. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=111.9s)]
*  In fact, we already have billions of dollars worth. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  But wait a second, you ask. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=116.78s)]
*  Isn't undocumented immigration a good thing? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=119.5s)]
*  Doesn't immigration increase diversity, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=123.16s)]
*  the blessed source of all beauty, power, and strength? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=125.26s)]
*  Well, sure, most of the time it does, but not in Ukraine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=128.32s)]
*  Ukraine exists for the exclusive presence of Ukrainians. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=133.0s)]
*  People who look or speak differently, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=137.5s)]
*  people from other places with say different religions [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=139.1s)]
*  are not allowed in Ukraine, period. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=141.86s)]
*  That's Nancy Pelosi's position. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=144.54s)]
*  Ukraine is the one place Nancy Pelosi [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=146.56s)]
*  very much wants to keep racially pure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=148.44s)]
*  She's willing to use lethal force to do that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  Virtually everyone in Congress agrees with Pelosi, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=153.52s)]
*  so does the White House. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=155.6s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden's deputy national security advisor [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  explaining that when undocumented foreign nationals [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=159.12s)]
*  arrive in Ukraine, they'll be killed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=161.56s)]
*  Why should Americans care about what's happening in Ukraine? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=164.96s)]
*  Because it goes to a very fundamental principle [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=170.36s)]
*  of all nations, which is that our borders [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=173.16s)]
*  should be inviolate, that our sovereignty [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=175.88s)]
*  should be respected. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=178.12s)]
*  Our borders should be inviolate. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=179.96s)]
*  Our sovereignty should be respected, meaning Ukraine's. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=181.7s)]
*  That man was Jonathan Finer. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=185.62s)]
*  He's Biden's deputy national security advisor. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=187.0s)]
*  It's interesting to note that Jonathan Finer [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=189.48s)]
*  has no relevant experience for the job he currently holds. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=191.16s)]
*  At one point he was a Washington Post reporter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=193.68s)]
*  That's reassuring. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=196.3s)]
*  Most recently, he was cashing in at a private equity firm [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  paying approximately half the federal tax rate you are. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=200.0s)]
*  Good for him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=202.68s)]
*  But one thing Jonathan Finer has learned along the way [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=203.9s)]
*  is that Ukrainian borders matter. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=207.74s)]
*  If you cross without permission, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=209.58s)]
*  you will be droned into the next life. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=212.06s)]
*  Kamala Harris strongly agrees with that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=215.46s)]
*  Here's Harris threatening would-be Russian immigrants. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=217.82000000000002s)]
*  The bottom line is that we have been clear [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=221.82000000000002s)]
*  and consistent for quite some time [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  that we respect the territorial integrity [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=227.02s)]
*  and sovereignty of Ukraine, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  and we expect that Russia would do the same [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=231.54s)]
*  and any aggressive action taken by Vladimir Putin [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=234.22s)]
*  will be met with severe consequences. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=238.14s)]
*  Severe consequences? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  The understatement is chilly. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=243.82s)]
*  That woman is bloodthirsty, that's where our borders are. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=245.98s)]
*  Try to cross the border [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=248.34s)]
*  and we'll take out your entire caravan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  Claim asylum? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=251.22s)]
*  What's asylum? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=252.06s)]
*  Don't think so. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  One toe over the line and you're dead. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=254.78s)]
*  Those are strong words, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=258.42s)]
*  but Kamala Harris appears to mean them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=259.3s)]
*  She probably does mean them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=260.74s)]
*  But again, you should know that Kamala Harris [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=261.7s)]
*  is not talking about our border here in the US, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=263.1s)]
*  she's talking about the Ukrainian border. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=265.14s)]
*  Now what's the difference between the two? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=266.42s)]
*  Well, the Ukrainian border by contrast [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=268.22s)]
*  is a place the Pentagon is willing to defend. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=273.86s)]
*  8,500 US military personnel on heightened alert. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=275.42s)]
*  Is this the ceiling of military personnel [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  that the administration will be committing to this conflict? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=282.82s)]
*  Do you see? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's what we're talking about today [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=287.02s)]
*  is about 8,500 on heightened alert. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  But as I said yesterday, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  we're certainly not gonna rule out other options. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=292.18s)]
*  Our job is to provide options to the president, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=294.18s)]
*  to the commander in chief, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  and we're gonna continue to do that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  And so I certainly would not rule out the possibility [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  that we could be putting additional forces [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=303.82000000000005s)]
*  on heightened alert in the coming days and weeks, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=305.78000000000003s)]

*  that are already there to bolster [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=310.86s)]
*  and to reassure some of our allies on the ground [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  on the continent. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=315.14000000000004s)]
*  Wait, we're only sending 8,500 American troops [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=317.54s)]
*  to protect the Ukrainian border? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=321.58s)]
*  Asked the teleprompter. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=323.38s)]
*  Well, says John Kirby, actually, we could send a lot more. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=324.46s)]
*  They're all poised to secure the sacred Ukrainian border. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=327.74s)]
*  So you may be wondering, how does that commitment compare [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=332.42s)]
*  to what the Pentagon is willing to deploy [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=335.18s)]
*  to our southern border? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=336.82s)]
*  Well, let's see a little back of the envelope math here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=339.54s)]
*  It's exactly 8,500 more [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=342.26s)]
*  because there are no troops, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=345.26s)]
*  no American troops heading to our southern border. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=346.58s)]
*  That may seem distressing to you, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  but in a way it makes sense. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=351.26s)]
*  Ukraine needs the troops. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=352.62s)]
*  Ukraine hasn't been invaded yet. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  We have been invaded and we lost. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=355.18s)]
*  We've been defeated. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=358.14s)]
*  And like all vanquished nations, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=359.74s)]
*  we're being treated with humiliating contempt [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=361.3s)]
*  by world leaders, in this case, by our own leaders. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=363.21999999999997s)]
*  Customs and Border Protection just released [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=366.82s)]
*  the latest statistics on the invasion ongoing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=368.7s)]
*  into this country. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  In the month of December, last month, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=371.98s)]
*  the feds encountered close to 180,000 illegal immigrants, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=374.38s)]
*  foreign nationals, whose identities we can't know [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=378.3s)]
*  on the southwest border. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=380.82s)]
*  Here, all living here now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=381.94s)]
*  How many people is that? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, for perspective, that's more than [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=385.06s)]
*  the three previous Decembers combined. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=386.42s)]
*  In the last calendar year, more than 2 million [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=390.3s)]
*  foreign nationals swept across the Mexican border, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=393.82s)]
*  unimpeded into this country and now live here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=396.65999999999997s)]
*  That's a lot of people, many times. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=400.02s)]
*  The population of Boston, Atlanta, Denver, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=402.14000000000004s)]
*  pick a city in one year. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=404.66s)]
*  But you know what's more than? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=407.06s)]
*  It's a lot more than the Russian army has masked [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=408.74s)]
*  on the Ukrainian border, something we're all hysterical about. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=410.66s)]
*  And of course, it's not just people coming illegally [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=413.62s)]
*  into this country, it's the drugs they are bringing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=416.70000000000005s)]
*  Record amounts of narcotics. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=419.1s)]
*  Narcotics that are driving the single most deadly [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=421.62s)]
*  drug epidemic in the history of this country. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=424.06s)]
*  You probably know someone who's had a loved one die. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=427.26000000000005s)]
*  Not just habitual drug users, but people using drugs [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=430.38s)]
*  recreationally that are mixed with fentanyl, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=432.65999999999997s)]
*  and they're dead. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=434.46s)]
*  Thousands and thousands, more than 100,000 in one year. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=436.18s)]
*  Who's doing this? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=439.82s)]
*  The cartels. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  They're killing far more Americans than Vladimir Putin [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=441.86s)]
*  ever could, and they're doing it with the help [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=444.74s)]
*  of the Biden administration. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=446.58s)]
*  But in the meantime, we've got 2 million, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=449.18s)]
*  more than new people living in this country. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=450.74s)]
*  Who are they? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=452.7s)]
*  Well, we can't say for sure. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=453.54s)]
*  No one really knows who they are. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=454.38s)]
*  That's part of the problem. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=455.86s)]
*  In an age when the rest of us are followed and surveilled [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=457.26s)]
*  and show your medical papers, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=461.14s)]
*  here's some facial recognition software. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=462.09999999999997s)]
*  We're letting in too many people. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=463.82s)]
*  We can't prove who they are. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=465.26s)]
*  We have no way of doing that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=466.65999999999997s)]
*  Don't let them lie to you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=467.82s)]
*  We do know they're coming from all over the world. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=469.38s)]
*  Fox's Bill Mollugin has been virtually the only person [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=471.86s)]
*  in American media to keep track of what is happening here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=474.7s)]
*  Here's part of what he found. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=477.94s)]
*  Video from a law enforcement source shows a single, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=479.78s)]
*  massive group of about 400 migrants who crossed illegally [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=482.62s)]
*  into Eagle Pass, Texas on Wednesday night. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=486.65999999999997s)]
*  Border Patrol photos show the size of that group, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=489.82s)]
*  with the sector chief himself saying, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=492.38s)]
*  this was no coincidence. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=494.29999999999995s)]
*  It was orchestrated by criminal elements for money. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=496.17999999999995s)]
*  The night before, the exact same thing happened. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=499.29999999999995s)]
*  Photos from Border Patrol show another group of 400 [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=502.34s)]
*  after they crossed illegally into Eagle Pass Tuesday night. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=505.94s)]
*  Here in the Rio Grande Valley, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  we embedded with Texas DPS as they tracked down runners [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=512.6999999999999s)]
*  in the brush looking to evade near La Jolla, Texas. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=515.72s)]
*  Two men in this group were from China. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=519.1s)]
*  That was Bill Mollugin on the border. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=523.86s)]
*  He's still there. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=525.4s)]
*  We'll go back to him in just a moment. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=526.24s)]
*  But this is an ongoing assault on our national sovereignty, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=527.82s)]
*  on our territorial integrity. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=532.82s)]
*  The things we've been hearing for the last month [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=535.1s)]
*  are so vitally important in Ukraine. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=536.7s)]
*  How's this happened? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=539.1s)]
*  Who's the Vladimir Putin in this morality tale? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=539.98s)]
*  Well, that would be Joe Biden. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=543.1s)]
*  This has all been allowed, enabled, encouraged by Joe Biden [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=544.62s)]
*  with the help of big corporations [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=548.08s)]
*  and left-wing nonprofits. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=552.0200000000001s)]
*  who really should be charged with a crime [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=554.4000000000001s)]
*  but hasn't been yet, recently bragged to CBS News [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=555.6s)]
*  that we're quoting, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=558.44s)]
*  we have fundamentally changed immigration enforcement [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  in the interior. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=561.84s)]
*  And we're continuing the quote, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=563.4000000000001s)]
*  for the first time ever, our policy explicitly states [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=564.32s)]
*  that a non-citizen's unlawful presence in the United States [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  will not by itself be a basis for the initiation [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=570.1800000000001s)]
*  of an enforcement action. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=572.96s)]
*  So what does that mean exactly? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=574.84s)]
*  So this is the guy charged with enforcing immigration laws, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=576.76s)]
*  laws that he did not create. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=581.56s)]
*  He's in the executive branch. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=582.56s)]
*  They don't create laws. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=583.56s)]
*  But here's the guy in charge of enforcing them, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=585.38s)]
*  bragging that he's decided to ignore federal law. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=587.08s)]
*  These are the laws that our Congress was elected to pass. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=589.92s)]
*  Oh, thwarting democracy anyone? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=595.08s)]
*  Pay no attention. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=597.84s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's the one who threatens democracy. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=598.68s)]
*  Everything's fine in this country. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=602.16s)]

*  They're not even trying. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=606.16s)]
*  Facebook's not a threat to democracy. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=608.2s)]
*  How could it be? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=609.68s)]

*  He's a good guy. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=612.04s)]
*  But Facebook is encouraging this invasion too. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=613.52s)]
*  Facebook helps its users share information [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  on how to cross the border illegally, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=618.8s)]
*  on how to break our laws. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=620.84s)]

*  Those are crimes too. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=632.12s)]
*  We can't say that they're doing that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=634.04s)]

*  we do allow people to share information [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=644.2199999999999s)]
*  about how to enter a country illegally [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=646.0999999999999s)]
*  or request information about how to be smuggled. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=648.5s)]
*  About how to be smuggled? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=652.74s)]
*  Facebook is helping people who quote, want to be smuggled? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=654.14s)]
*  In addition to being totally evil, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=658.3399999999999s)]
*  these people have no self-awareness. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=660.5s)]
*  Imagine saying something like that. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=661.98s)]
*  Uber does it too. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=663.38s)]
*  Uber drivers are picking up illegal migrants [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=664.34s)]
*  from the border. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=666.0600000000001s)]
*  We know because Fox News spoke to one driver in Arizona [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=667.26s)]
*  who said quote, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=669.5400000000001s)]
*  I just will get a notification of a pickup, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=670.82s)]
*  head down to the location. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=672.94s)]
*  There'll be a group of 20 plus immigrants [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=674.14s)]
*  standing on the corner waiting for Ubers. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=675.74s)]
*  So again, if Facebook and Uber [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=678.6600000000001s)]
*  were abetting child trafficking, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=681.6600000000001s)]
*  which on some level they are, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=683.1800000000001s)]
*  because child trafficking is an integral part [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=684.98s)]
*  of illegal immigration, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=686.94s)]
*  so is drug trafficking, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=688.1s)]
*  maybe someone would wake up and do something about it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=690.0600000000001s)]
*  You're seeing people rotting in solitary [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=693.7s)]
*  because they trespassed in the Capitol, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=695.46s)]
*  but Uber and Facebook [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=697.0600000000001s)]
*  are helping people violate federal law [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=698.86s)]
*  and we don't care? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=701.0200000000001s)]
*  No one in Congress is investigating any of this. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=702.62s)]
*  Sounds like sedition to us. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=705.4200000000001s)]
*  But they're busy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=708.5400000000001s)]
*  They're sending hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=709.4200000000001s)]
*  of lethal weapons to Ukraine to help with their border. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=711.3000000000001s)]
*  Pentagon's not sending troops to our border, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=714.1400000000001s)]
*  they're sending them to Ukraine's border. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=715.82s)]
*  So that's the Biden administration's approach. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=717.7800000000001s)]
*  That approach is virtually uncontested in Washington. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=719.8199999999999s)]
*  Here's Mitch McConnell, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=723.22s)]
*  who poses by day as leader of the opposition in the Senate. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=724.42s)]
*  What I've been hearing since then is encouraging [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=729.3399999999999s)]
*  that they're prepared to take steps [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  before an incursion, not afterwards. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=739.1s)]
*  I've not been near the news this morning, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=743.66s)]
*  so I'm not sure what additionally may have occurred, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=745.62s)]
*  but it appears to me the administration [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=750.62s)]
*  is moving in the right direction. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=752.1s)]
*  Yeah, it appears that way. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=753.6600000000001s)]
*  If the direction you wanna move [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=755.5s)]
*  is to completely change the population of the country [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=756.9000000000001s)]
*  for political reasons, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=759.1s)]
*  let two million people in one year, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=760.58s)]
*  people whose identities you can't confirm, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=762.94s)]
*  whose intentions you don't know, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=764.58s)]
*  who are bringing with them records amounts of narcotics [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=766.1800000000001s)]
*  that killed over a hundred thousand Americans. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=768.4200000000001s)]
*  If that's the goal, then Mitch McConnell, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=770.1800000000001s)]
*  you're onto something, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=771.62s)]
*  you're moving in the right direction. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=772.46s)]
*  But if the goal is to have a first world country [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=773.7s)]
*  where laws mean something, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=775.7s)]
*  probably not the right direction. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=776.7800000000001s)]
*  So why are you telling us otherwise, Mitch McConnell? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=777.94s)]
*  Who are you working for exactly? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=779.38s)]
*  Whose side are you on? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=781.26s)]
*  I think we know. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=782.22s)]
*  Who's paying for all this stuff? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=784.54s)]
*  Well, you are. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=785.46s)]
*  American citizens are paying for it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=786.66s)]
*  The United Nations, which takes billions [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=788.34s)]
*  of US tax dollars, is paying for it too. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=789.9s)]
*  They're giving out cash to illegal migrants [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=791.74s)]
*  heading to our border. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=793.58s)]
*  An investigation by the Center for Immigration Studies [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=794.86s)]
*  found the UN has been handing out cash debit cards [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=797.34s)]
*  to US bound illegal aliens and giving them advice [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=800.54s)]
*  on how to claim asylum in our country, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=803.66s)]
*  on how to game our system, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=805.46s)]
*  on how to make a mockery of our laws. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=806.74s)]
*  They don't respect us. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=808.86s)]
*  We don't respect ourselves enough to stop this. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=809.94s)]
*  Once these migrants get here, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=813.0600000000001s)]
*  authorities do everything possible to make sure they stay. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=814.22s)]
*  The Biden administration attempted on day one [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=816.9000000000001s)]
*  to pause all deportations. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=818.5s)]
*  That moratorium, thank God, was blocked by a federal judge, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=820.3000000000001s)]
*  but it hardly matters. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=822.46s)]
*  The administration is continuing to abet criminal behavior. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=824.38s)]
*  They're allowing illegals to use their arrest warrants [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=826.62s)]
*  as ID in airports. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=828.7800000000001s)]
*  You try that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=830.6600000000001s)]
*  Sorry, don't have my ID, but I do have my arrest warrant. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=831.5s)]
*  Can I get housing subsidies, food stamps, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=833.9000000000001s)]
*  free healthcare and a flight? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=835.82s)]
*  Sure you can. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=837.0600000000001s)]
*  You're from another country. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=838.06s)]
*  Americans don't get that. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=839.66s)]
*  Here's another report from Bill Mollugian. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=840.9799999999999s)]
*  TSA confirms to Fox News [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=843.9s)]
*  that the agency is allowing illegal immigrants [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=845.5799999999999s)]
*  to use arrest warrants as ID [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=847.6999999999999s)]
*  at security checkpoints in airports, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=850.3399999999999s)]
*  telling us in part, quote, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=852.38s)]
*  for non-citizens and non-US nationals [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=853.78s)]
*  who do not otherwise have acceptable forms of ID [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=856.2199999999999s)]
*  for presentation at security checkpoints, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=858.8599999999999s)]
*  TSA may also accept certain DHS issued forms, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=861.26s)]
*  including ICE form I-200, warrant for arrest of an alien. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=864.86s)]
*  You just can't repeat this enough. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=870.98s)]
*  And again, we're doing this, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=872.54s)]
*  not because we think it's gonna change anything. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=873.46s)]
*  It won't. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=875.26s)]
*  This is just a TV show, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=876.58s)]
*  but we want a record of what's happening right now. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=877.66s)]
*  History is rewritten, unfortunately, by the victors, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=880.38s)]
*  and the details disappear. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=884.7s)]
*  But we think the details are important. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=886.5s)]
*  We think we all should be allowed to know [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=888.58s)]
*  why this is happening and how it's happening. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=891.1800000000001s)]
*  So just to restate, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=893.3000000000001s)]
*  we're allowing foreigners who came here illegally [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=895.58s)]
*  in violation of our laws, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=897.78s)]
*  which are unenforced by our current government, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=900.02s)]
*  which is undermining democracy by its refusal [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=902.18s)]
*  to enforce those laws, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=905.46s)]
*  those people get to use their arrest warrants [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=906.78s)]
*  to get on airplanes while you have to show ID. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=909.14s)]
*  Meanwhile, again, you can't say this enough, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=913.3s)]
*  we'll stop after this, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=914.82s)]
*  Congress is doing everything it can, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=915.9s)]
*  pulling out all the stops to send more money [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=918.02s)]
*  to Eastern Europe to protect the borders of Ukraine. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=921.38s)]
*  It's like it's not even real, but it is real. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaPwux0VLo&t=925.26s)]
