# Riley Gaines to Tucker: This does not deter me, this does not silence me
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q)
*  But Raleigh Gaines will say that because she's not afraid. So last night, Gaines went to San [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Francisco State University to talk about her experiences in NCAA swimming. And Raleigh Gaines [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=3.52s)]
*  is not a hater. She is a measured, decent person who believes in logic and reason and finding common [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=8.64s)]
*  ground with people who disagree with her. She does not think she is God. But that fact is not [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=15.92s)]
*  believe she's God makes her a terrifying threat to the zealots who do do their God. And so at San [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=22.56s)]
*  Francisco State last night, the zealots attacked her a mob surrounded Raleigh Gaines and prevented [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=28.96s)]
*  her from moving through the hallways. At one point, the thug said they wouldn't let her pass [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  unless she let she. During the chaos, a man dressed as a woman punched her several times. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=37.92s)]
*  The mob howled with rage, screaming threats and obscenities. We're not overstating. Here's what it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=44.0s)]
*  looked like. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=48.56s)]
*  That's the most dangerous extremist group in the United States. There's no mistaking it. Raleigh [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=78.56s)]
*  Gaines once again is not an ideologue or a demagogue. She's not out to hurt anybody. She's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=99.76s)]
*  a college swimmer who was cheated against and doesn't think that's fair. In the face of that, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=105.12s)]
*  people threaten her life and scream transparently nonsensical things like trans women are women. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=112.56s)]
*  Trans women are not women. Women are men are women and men are men. And that's unalterable. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=117.92s)]
*  And if you think otherwise, you were delusional and they are delusional and therefore dangerous. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  Last night, Raleigh Gaines was silenced and assaulted at San Francisco State. Her most basic [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=130.0s)]
*  civil rights were stolen by a violent mob. The thing we're supposed to be on the lookout for. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=134.8s)]
*  Well, there it is. If there is such a thing as a hate crime, you just saw it. And yet the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=140.08s)]
*  administration and its thoroughly corrupt Department of Justice won't acknowledge that any of that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=146.72s)]
*  happened because they endorse it happening. Raleigh Gaines is one of the bravest people we know and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  we're grateful to have her join us tonight. Raleigh Gaines, thank you so much for coming on. Was that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=155.68s)]
*  as horrifying as it looked? I mean, it was terrifying. The police did not inform me of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=159.76s)]
*  any sort of action plan. Turning Point USA invited me to the campus. I delivered a very civil and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=168.56s)]
*  respectful speech where I had great dialogue with even protesters who were participating in a sit [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  in. All of the sudden, after my speech, the room was stormed. The lights were turned off and I was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  rushed with no one there to escort me to a safe place. I was punched. I was hit multiple times. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=185.28s)]
*  I was shoved until finally we exited the room, but we could not leave because the protesters [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=192.64s)]
*  flooded the halls. And so I was pushed into a classroom along that hallway where I was barricaded [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  in for three hours. Three hours. Why didn't someone with a gun come and bring you to safety? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=205.04s)]
*  Because they were terrified. They were scared to put their hands on these people because they know [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=212.56s)]
*  what these people are capable of. These people yelled obscene, violent, vulgar things to both [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=218.8s)]
*  myself and the officers and the officers, I could tell, didn't feel comfortable putting them in a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=225.44s)]
*  position that would mean they do their job, which is a really scary, chilling thought. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=230.32s)]
*  This is the most dangerous extremist movement in the United States right now. It's getting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=238.4s)]
*  bigger, not smaller. It's gaining steam, not losing it. The White House has endorsed it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=242.16s)]
*  I mean, what does this mean for you? And I just can't say it again, since I happen to know you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=246.64s)]
*  You are an inherently moderate person who means harm to no one. But are you worried about your [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=251.12s)]
*  safety going forward? You know, I am worried about my safety. I have to be now. When we have people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=255.92s)]
*  who are willing to do this, and we know why they're willing to do this, it's because they don't have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=262.96s)]
*  reason. They don't have logic. They don't have science. They don't have common sense on their [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=267.68s)]
*  side. That's on my side. And so they they protrude by violence, whether it's physical or verbal [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=271.44s)]
*  violence. But what this means for me, this does not deter me. This assures me that I am doing the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=278.56s)]
*  right thing. This will not silence me when they want me to be silenced. It just means I need to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=284.4s)]
*  speak louder. Really quick, has any, did anyone in the state of California in authority, any political [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=288.8s)]
*  figure, for example, defend you? No, not the dean of students, not the campus police. I will say [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=296.56s)]
*  the city of San Francisco police that stepped in, they did a phenomenal job in escorting [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=304.48s)]
*  three hours later. But I will be pursuing legal action. I will ensure that the people who [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=308.88s)]
*  physically assaulted me, the people who put me in that position, they will face repercussions. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=315.36s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if we can't identify that as evil, then we've really lost the thread. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=321.6s)]
*  Riley Gaines, I'm glad you're still here and Godspeed. Absolutely. Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_2VMImU7Q&t=326.16s)]
