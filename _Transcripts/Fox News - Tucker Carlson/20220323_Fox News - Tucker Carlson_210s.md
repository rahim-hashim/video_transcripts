# Candace Owens: They don't want you looking into this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w)
*  So Candace Owens is completely unafraid of anyone, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=0.0s)]
*  so she's often accused of things. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=2.52s)]
*  The New York Times, in its latest salvo, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=3.88s)]
*  is accusing her of working for Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  A reporter just wrote to Candace Owens, quote, quote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  we note you have advanced the idea [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  that Ukraine was a corrupt country, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=12.0s)]
*  which matched comments we've seen from Russian state media. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=13.98s)]
*  Oh, call Ukraine corrupt, is Russian propaganda. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=16.84s)]
*  So here's what Candace Owens wrote in response. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=21.28s)]
*  I'm very confused by this email. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=23.16s)]
*  I learned about Ukraine's corruption [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=24.76s)]
*  from the New York Times. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=26.96s)]
*  As just one example, here's a piece [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=28.72s)]
*  from the New York Times editorial board [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=30.28s)]
*  entitled Ukraine's Unyielding Corruption. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=31.48s)]
*  Greatest response ever. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=36.16s)]
*  Founder of the charity, Blexit, Candace Owens joins us now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=37.84s)]
*  That is just too great. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=41.36s)]
*  How did they respond to you, Candace? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=42.92s)]
*  I mean, I also sent them even more links. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=46.36s)]
*  I mean, that was just one link that I sent them, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=48.28s)]
*  but there's 10, 20 links between The Washington Post [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  and The New York Times over the last three or four years [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=53.08s)]
*  telling us about how unyielding the corruption is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  and really spelling out to us how corrupt President Zelensky [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=57.66s)]
*  is, but they've magically changed their mind. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  So I was confused. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=62.5s)]
*  Maybe Russian disinformation means now [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  for The New York Times truth, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  given the Hunter Biden laptop scenario, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=66.94s)]
*  which they called Russian disinformation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=68.89999999999999s)]
*  and they now acknowledge is fully true. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=70.82s)]
*  Obviously he responded and said, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=73.39999999999999s)]
*  thank you for sending these links, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=74.74s)]
*  and then completely moved the goalposts [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=76.3s)]
*  and asked me whether or not I accepted [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=78.22s)]
*  the official government narrative regarding bio labs [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  and whether they were just opened for research. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=84.62s)]
*  And I said, this is completely nonsensical. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=86.54s)]
*  What does this have to do with your initial question? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=88.26s)]
*  And then I sent him another link and I said, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=90.3s)]
*  is that the official government narrative [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=92.06s)]
*  regarding bio labs? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=94.22s)]
*  Is it for research? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=95.4s)]
*  Because you guys also told me in another article [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=96.3s)]
*  that they were funding these labs [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=98.62s)]
*  to shut down previous Soviet labs. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  And then he just said, thank you for your time. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=103.26s)]
*  No more questions because I don't think he's reading [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  The New York Times and doesn't realize [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=108.02s)]
*  how many times they pivot the narrative. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=110.06s)]
*  And here's the thing, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=111.94s)]
*  nobody believes this Russian puppet stuff. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=113.3s)]
*  I mean, it's just ridiculous. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=115.06s)]
*  Black women in the United States [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=117.46s)]
*  have never even been to Russia. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=118.3s)]
*  I mean, I can't think of a Russian food [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  off the top of my head. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=121.58s)]
*  I mean, it's so ridiculous. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=122.41999999999999s)]
*  I refuse to give it any air. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=123.72s)]
*  But they say these things when you arrive at a truth [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  that they don't want them looking at, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=127.88s)]
*  that they don't want the public at large looking at. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  They say, oh, looky over here, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=131.66s)]
*  nevermind this person's a Russian puppet, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=132.74s)]
*  exactly like they did with the Hunter Biden laptop [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=134.56s)]
*  until they were ready to acknowledge the truth. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=136.74s)]
*  So I really tried to reflect on what it was [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  that I was hitting at that was bothering them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  And really it was me talking about Zelensky. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  Zelensky right now, according to the mainstream narrative, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=145.1s)]
*  the new mainstream narrative I should say, is Batman, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=147.9s)]
*  We're all supposed to just go, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=150.98s)]
*  he's an amazing hero when he's not corrupt. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=151.82s)]
*  And I've been talking about their previous covering of him [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=153.66s)]
*  in the Pandora papers, talking about his ties to, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=156.42s)]
*  you know, Ukrainian billionaires [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=159.22s)]
*  that have a controlling interest in Burisma. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=161.04s)]
*  That might be a significant conversation [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=165.06s)]
*  for the press to have in a moment [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=166.88s)]
*  when we have Biden's administration egging us on, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=168.78s)]
*  trying to get us more involved in this conflict in Ukraine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=171.1s)]
*  And they don't want that conversation to be had. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=174.14s)]
*  So instead they're going with a black female [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=176.22s)]
*  from the United States is somehow on Putin's payroll, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=178.33999999999997s)]
*  which is just pointedly ridiculous. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  Oh, I know the feeling. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=182.98s)]
*  Russian disinformation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=184.22s)]
*  So the Biden family's patron's in trouble, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  the US military has to save him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=189.77999999999997s)]
*  But mentioning that, not allowed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=191.7s)]
*  Candace Owens, fearless as always, I appreciate it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=194.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=196.38s)]
*  And most compelling analysis, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=204.14s)]
*  you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeUVrVkrP8w&t=206.05999999999997s)]
