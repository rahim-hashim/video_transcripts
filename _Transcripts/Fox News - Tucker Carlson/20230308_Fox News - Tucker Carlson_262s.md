# Russell Brand and Tucker Carlson talk spirituality and fame
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg)
*  Russell Brand has been an actor, a comedian, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=0.0s)]
*  a podcast host for decades. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=2.5s)]
*  All of a sudden, he's one of the most forceful voices [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=4.18s)]
*  for the truth in the English speaking world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=6.82s)]
*  He's also a deeply interesting person [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=10.82s)]
*  with a lot of insights about God. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  Amazing, Russell Brand. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=15.14s)]
*  We sat down with him for a long conversation, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=16.98s)]
*  a brand new episode of Tucker Carlson today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=19.14s)]
*  Here's a small part of it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=20.98s)]
*  ["The Fear of God"] [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=22.78s)]
*  As much as I might enjoy the feeling of privilege [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=26.64s)]
*  and luxury, and I'm certainly making no claims [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=29.6s)]
*  to be an ascetic, I remember what reality is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  I remember that my wellness is contingent [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=35.6s)]
*  upon spiritual connection, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=38.8s)]
*  upon certain values and principles, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  and they, I am sorry to admit, involve sacrifice [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  and self-scrutiny about my own conduct and behavior, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=45.88s)]
*  which is often, often falls short, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=49.32s)]
*  and I'm working on improving myself. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=52.28s)]
*  I continue to work on improving myself. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=54.22s)]
*  So when I sort of hear morality sort of as bombast, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=56.46s)]
*  or when I hear rhetoric divorced from compassion, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=60.46s)]
*  it makes me feel uneasy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=63.38s)]
*  So I've been blessed with a very practical spirituality, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=64.9s)]
*  like many desperate people. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=67.58s)]
*  I need spirituality, I need God, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=69.22s)]
*  or I cannot cope in this world. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=71.5s)]
*  I need to believe in the best in people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=73.18s)]
*  I need to believe that there are new alliances possible, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=75.26s)]
*  new ways of us communicating, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=77.66s)]
*  because I see atrophying and corrupt systems [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=79.26s)]
*  delivering yet more misery to people, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=82.36s)]
*  and I think it's increasingly necessary [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=83.6s)]
*  that we find new ways of framing the conversation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=85.6s)]
*  and looking into our hearts when we're speaking. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=87.52s)]
*  Are we being kind? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=89.6s)]
*  Are we being loving? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=90.92s)]
*  Are we being the best that we can be? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=91.96s)]
*  On whose behalf are we speaking, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=93.92s)]
*  and what is my intention moment to moment? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=95.6s)]
*  Am I doing this for self-glorification? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Am I doing this because I have obligations [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=100.12s)]
*  to rumble the platform I'm on, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  or am I doing this because I genuinely believe [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=103.52s)]
*  that a better world is possible, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=105.84s)]
*  and that world is born individually within each of us, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=107.12s)]
*  moment to moment, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=109.72s)]
*  and it's possible to change. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=111.02000000000001s)]
*  I genuinely believe in change, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=111.86s)]
*  and I'm not on my court a misanthrope. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=112.7s)]
*  I don't believe that we need systems of condemnation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=113.54s)]
*  I don't believe that if people aren't heavily policed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=117.06s)]
*  and heavily controlled, they will behave badly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=119.22s)]
*  I believe that we can self-organize. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=121.5s)]
*  I believe I'm optimistic about your country, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=123.5s)]
*  and I'm optimistic about mine, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=125.7s)]
*  and I'm optimistic about the world, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=127.06s)]
*  but I think the price of that optimism [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=128.86s)]
*  is a degree of reason and an acceptance [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=130.58s)]
*  that many people see the world [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=132.66s)]
*  very, very differently at this time, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=133.9s)]
*  and we're gonna have to allow one another [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=135.66s)]
*  some of the things that we can do [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=137.66s)]
*  and we're gonna have to allow one another [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=139.0s)]
*  some distance to be who we are, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=140.6s)]
*  whether that's individually or communally, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=142.2s)]
*  and these are the areas that interest me, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=144.48s)]
*  and these are the things that have always interested me. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=146.48s)]
*  The fact was I just didn't have enough self-discipline [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  to resist the allure of stardom, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  and I fell face first into the glitter, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=154.16s)]
*  and I'm only just pulling myself out now, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  but once I stopped drinking and taking drugs, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=158.48s)]
*  it became clear that there was a lot more on offer. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=160.56s)]
*  The ability to, in fact, as they say, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  the term recovery is undergirded by the idea [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  that we recover the person we're intended to be, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=170.0s)]
*  and this idea of intention, I think, is rather beautiful [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  because when you live in a nihilistic, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=175.44000000000003s)]
*  post-rationalistic, materialistic world [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  where there can be no telos, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  where there can be no glory, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  where there can be no meaning, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  none of us are meant to be anything, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=183.58s)]
*  but the idea that there might be a purpose for you, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  that there might be something that you can become, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=187.8s)]
*  I found this idea very engaging [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  and very comforting, and I've got to be honest, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=194.6s)]
*  it also engaged the more egoic and narcissistic aspects of me [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=196.66s)]
*  that I could achieve something in my life, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  but as time has gone on, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  there's an ongoing tension between those things, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=204.42s)]
*  individual achievement and an ongoing desire [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=206.42s)]
*  for recognition and plaudits, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=209.14s)]
*  but a deeper understanding [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=210.9s)]
*  that there is something valuable here on offer, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  that we can achieve something, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=215.42s)]
*  and it's actually quite humble, irritatingly, isn't it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  Like, it's mostly about helping people directly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  My world view is formed by spiritual principles [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=222.68s)]
*  rather than political principles, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=227.28s)]
*  that my values are derived from quite simple ideas [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=230.0s)]
*  around kindness, community, acceptance, gratitude, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=232.94s)]
*  and I'm making no claim to practice these principles [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=236.24s)]
*  anything like perfectly, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=239.04s)]
*  but at least I know what I'm aspiring to, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=240.44s)]
*  and I know that my spirituality is about my conduct [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=242.64s)]
*  and how I behave rather than telling other people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=245.56s)]
*  how they should behave. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=248.44s)]
*  Check out the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=252.66s)]
*  to catch our nightly opens, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=254.28s)]
*  stories that are changing the world [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=256.32s)]
*  and changing your life. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=258.32s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY62OU8ZKg&t=260.0s)]
