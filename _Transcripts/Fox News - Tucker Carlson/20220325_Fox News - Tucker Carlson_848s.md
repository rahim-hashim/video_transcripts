# Tucker: We may not have enough food soon
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's 10 happy Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=0.0s)]
*  In retrospect, Joe Biden's first term policy agenda seems very optimistic, almost comically [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=5.48s)]
*  optimistic. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=11.88s)]
*  Shortly before his inauguration, Biden announced something he called the build back better [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=13.24s)]
*  agenda, which we mocked it at the time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=17.32s)]
*  But looking back, it was in some ways a hopeful document. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  America must have been a very rich country back then. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=23.96s)]
*  And by back then, we mean last year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=26.52s)]
*  There weren't a lot of essentials in Biden's agenda. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=29.4s)]
*  The first three things that any normal nation needs and thinks about obsessively are food, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  water and energy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  That's the standard in China, for example. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=39.64s)]
*  Every government policy, foreign and domestic, is designed above all to secure adequate reserves [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=41.8s)]
*  of food, water and energy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=47.64s)]
*  And that makes sense. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  The build back better agenda was the opposite of that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  It did not suggest any concern at all about whether Americans might have enough to eat [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=55.74s)]
*  or could afford enough heating fuel to keep from freezing to death over the winter. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=59.86s)]
*  Biden's agenda was focused on the kind of added extras you get to when you fixed everything [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=63.94s)]
*  else and then still have trillions left over. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=68.14s)]
*  Build back better promised us something called environmental equity, whatever that is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  It demanded amnesty for millions of illegal aliens because at the time, the American economy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=75.36s)]
*  seemed robust enough to share with the entire world. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=80.38s)]
*  Universal health care for Honduras. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=83.62s)]
*  Biden called for free solar panels for everybody and taxpayer funded pre-K for all American [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=86.62s)]
*  parents and so on and on. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=91.18s)]
*  Build back better was the neoliberal version of flying cars. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  It was a dreamy Christmas list of luxuries that for a moment in time seemed almost within [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=96.78s)]
*  reach. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=102.66s)]
*  A lot has changed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  Nobody's talking about flying cars anymore. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden from yesterday. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  With regard to food shortage, yes we did. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=110.34s)]
*  Talk about food shortages and it's going to be real. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=113.3s)]
*  The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=117.94s)]
*  It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=122.62s)]
*  our country as well. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  And because both Russia and Ukraine have been the breadbasket of Europe in terms of wheat, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=129.3s)]
*  for example. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=135.86s)]
*  Just give one example. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=136.86s)]
*  Biden said, quote, they're going to be real. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=140.5s)]
*  Once again, in case you missed it, to repeat, food shortages. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=142.62s)]
*  Not in Sudan, in Cincinnati and Reno and Spokane and Norfolk and of course in our big cities [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=146.38s)]
*  too. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=152.38s)]
*  We're not a single person who was born here has any idea what a food shortage is. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=153.38s)]
*  Our problem has always been having too much food. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=157.18s)]
*  Now we won't have enough. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=159.54s)]
*  We know that because the president of the United States just told us that on camera. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=160.54s)]
*  So what is this going to mean? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=164.22s)]
*  How do food shortages affect a country? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=165.54s)]
*  Well, if you're interested, go online and read about it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  All of recorded history will answer your question. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=170.42s)]
*  A food shortage is not like deciding to skip dessert. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=173.14s)]
*  It's not a diet. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=176.18s)]
*  It's not voluntary. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=177.18s)]
*  A food shortage is different. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=178.18s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=179.94s)]
*  Food shortages topple governments. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=180.94s)]
*  They turn moderates into revolutionaries. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=182.82s)]
*  A food shortage is a big deal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=184.98s)]
*  You don't want one. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=186.38s)]
*  But now we're getting one. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  Just a little over a year into Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=189.4s)]
*  Think forward. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  If the traditional calendar holds, we've got 1,032 days left of the Joe Biden administration. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=193.58s)]
*  And you wonder what things will look like by then. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=200.58s)]
*  We're already speeding toward dystopia. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=202.18s)]
*  Not that the White House seems aware of it or to care in any way. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=204.06s)]
*  Here's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen from this morning, for example, letting you know [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=207.9s)]
*  it's time to stop whining about gas prices because actually they're not very high. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=211.38000000000002s)]
*  How high do you think oil prices can get at the pump? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=217.18s)]
*  Listen, there's a lot of uncertainty about it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  They're not as high in real terms as they were earlier in this century. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=226.22s)]
*  And it's conceivable that they could move higher. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=233.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a big deal. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=238.78s)]
*  Settle down. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=241.46s)]
*  And there's a reason for it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=242.46s)]
*  As Joe Biden explained, you're paying more for gas because we have slapped sanctions [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=243.9s)]
*  on Russia. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=247.46s)]
*  And sanctioning Russia is the right thing to do. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=248.46s)]
*  So shut up and feel virtuous as you slowly go broke. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  Now, for some people, particularly those who don't drive cars, this might seem like an [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=254.06s)]
*  adequate answer. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=257.62s)]
*  But others in good faith may ask, OK, I'm not against sanctions in theory. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=258.7s)]
*  But since they're clearly not hurting Putin and they clearly are now hurting my family, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=264.22s)]
*  what is the point of sanctions? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=268.62s)]
*  Is there a point? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=270.22s)]
*  Let me know. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=271.22s)]
*  Make me feel better. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=272.22s)]
*  And the answer is, yes, America, there's a point to sanctions. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=273.22s)]
*  Sanctions are designed to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=276.82s)]
*  We know that because not so long ago, Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, told CNN [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=280.86s)]
*  that quote, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=284.58s)]
*  And then Jen Psaki, the president's publicist, backed him up. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=290.98s)]
*  Quote, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris agreed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=296.94s)]
*  The difference, she said, the deterrent effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=298.82s)]
*  So sanctions work, except they didn't actually work. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=304.34s)]
*  Putin invaded Ukraine anyway. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=308.17999999999995s)]
*  The sanctions failed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=310.09999999999997s)]
*  So what's the response? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=312.46s)]
*  Admit they failed? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=313.46s)]
*  Try something new? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=314.46s)]
*  No. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=315.46s)]
*  Joe Biden is pretending that the administration never claimed sanctions would deter Russia [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=316.46s)]
*  from invading Ukraine. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=319.73999999999995s)]
*  Here's the new line. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  Let's get something straight. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=322.41999999999996s)]
*  You remember, if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=323.97999999999996s)]
*  sanctions would deter him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=328.9s)]
*  Sanctions never deter. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=331.78s)]
*  You keep talking about that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=333.58000000000004s)]
*  Sanctions never deter. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=336.22s)]
*  The maintenance of sanctions, the maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=338.26000000000005s)]
*  the demonstration why I asked for this NATO meeting today is to be sure that after a month [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  we will sustain what we're doing, not just next month, the following month, but for the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=349.82000000000005s)]
*  remainder of this entire year. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=355.46000000000004s)]
*  That's what will stop him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=357.74s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=359.54s)]
*  Sanctions never deter. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=362.74s)]
*  Why do you keep saying that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=363.74s)]
*  He said, well, because you kept saying that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=364.74s)]
*  Your White House press secretary, your vice president, your secretary of state all said [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=367.26s)]
*  that verbatim. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=371.54s)]
*  But they're not acknowledging that, hoping that our memories have been so damaged by [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=373.94s)]
*  the iPhone will be as forgetful as Joe Biden himself. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=376.98s)]
*  Now they want us to believe that sanctioning Russia can force Putin into withdrawing from [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=385.46000000000004s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=386.66s)]
*  Can Putin be sanctioned into retreat? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=387.98s)]
*  Well, we certainly hope it's true sincerely, but there's no evidence that it is true. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=389.9s)]

*  But in the meantime, this country, we know this for sure, is being badly hurt by those [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=412.38s)]

*  Food shortages, which are a direct result of policy from the White House, a policy whose [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=444.06s)]
*  intended effect is still not clear. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=451.06s)]
*  What is the point of this? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=454.34s)]
*  If there's a good point, people will put up with it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=455.34s)]
*  Why don't you tell us what that point is? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=457.1s)]
*  Fertilizer bills are expected to jump around 15% just this year, and they could go higher. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=460.22s)]

*  The U.S. imports $10.3 billion worth of fertilizer for crops. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=485.06s)]
*  1.3 billion of that comes from Russia, which is now off the market. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=490.06s)]
*  The Minnesota Association of Wheat Growers says farmers lay down fertilizer at least [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=494.66s)]
*  twice a year. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=499.5s)]
*  There's a lot of fertilizers that are 4 and 5X more expensive than they were a year ago. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=500.5s)]
*  Fertilizer has drastically outpaced the rate of inflation. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=506.26000000000005s)]
*  Russia's ban on fertilizer is scheduled to last until the end of the year. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=509.66s)]
*  And while supply is already tight this year, it's the future many are worried about. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=513.58s)]
*  So sanctions have thrown American agriculture into profound turmoil and will cause, again, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=520.66s)]
*  as the president has told us out loud, food shortages, which are maybe the most destabilizing [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=527.78s)]

*  There are a lot of reasons. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=541.2199999999999s)]
*  It's not just the war in Ukraine. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=542.2199999999999s)]
*  In response to energy and food shortages, the Biden administration is shutting down [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=544.4599999999999s)]
*  domestic oil and gas production. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=548.3000000000001s)]

*  And as the pressure on American farmers rises and as food becomes scarcer and more expensive [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=554.34s)]
*  in this country, that same administration is allowing the government of China to buy [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=559.26s)]
*  up this country's farmland. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=563.82s)]
*  According to Politico, and this was two years ago, Chinese investors own nearly 200,000 [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=566.46s)]
*  acres of U.S. ag land valued at at least $2 billion. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=571.58s)]
*  Now they're doing this in part with the help of subsidies paid for by U.S. taxpayers. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=575.98s)]
*  And Chinese investors are continuing to buy more every single year. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=580.4200000000001s)]
*  Again, food, water, energy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=584.82s)]
*  That's what you need for a country. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=588.66s)]
*  The Chinese understand that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=589.86s)]
*  As Congressman Dan Neuhaus put it, quote, the current trend in the United States is leading [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=591.78s)]
*  us toward the creation of a Chinese-owned agricultural land monopoly. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=595.22s)]

*  is our main global enemy. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=611.2s)]
*  Owned by a country that seeks to displace us and punish us. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=613.56s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=617.16s)]
*  Would the Chinese government permit American investors to buy its country's farmland or [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=618.16s)]
*  water resources? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=623.12s)]
*  That's not even a real question. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=625.24s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=626.72s)]
*  No sane country would do that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=627.88s)]
*  And no foreign entity should be allowed to control America's critical natural resources. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=629.48s)]
*  So how long until the Chinese start scooping up the Great Lakes, which are our largest [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=634.16s)]
*  reservoirs of fresh water? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=637.38s)]
*  Food, water, energy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=639.12s)]
*  Don't laugh. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=640.96s)]
*  That's where we're headed. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=641.96s)]
*  And it could happen much sooner than anyone seems to realize. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=642.96s)]

*  So instead of addressing any of these problems, our leaders are responding in the one way [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=745.42s)]
*  they know how. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=749.14s)]

*  California Governor Gavin Newsom, for example, just announced he's about to give his residents [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=757.02s)]
*  another free credit card. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=760.38s)]
*  So today we're announcing a $9 billion tax refund to tens of millions of Californians. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=763.02s)]
*  $400 for each registered vehicle that an individual owns, up to two vehicles. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=768.54s)]
*  That direct relief will address the issue that we all are struggling to address, and [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=774.34s)]
*  that's the issue of gas prices. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=778.94s)]

*  anything that Governor Newsom said, what he's saying is tax prices are really high, so we're [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=787.94s)]
*  going to give you a tax refund, whether or not you pay taxes, it's welfare. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=792.0600000000001s)]
*  And that's going to solve the problem. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=797.7s)]
*  What he doesn't say is that California has the highest gas prices in America because [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohGa1DcA6BI&t=799.22s)]
