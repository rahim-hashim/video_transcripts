# Elon Musk tells Tucker this trajectory is ‘depressing as hell’
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw)
*  So Elon Musk has spent a lot of his life thinking about space and he's got the world's biggest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=0.0s)]
*  rocket company. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=4.2s)]
*  So we asked him, have you ever seen anything out there that suggests alien life? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=5.2s)]
*  And by the way, how do you think life on this planet is going? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk has put on the rare voices to raise the alarm about lower birth rates. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=12.88s)]
*  He's doing something about it personally. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=17.6s)]
*  He thinks the rest of us should too. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=19.48s)]
*  Here's this part of the conversation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=21.36s)]
*  People sometimes take the fact that we're here on Earth full-granted and that consciousness [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=24.36s)]
*  is just a normal thing that happens. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  But to the best of our knowledge, we see no evidence of conscious life anywhere in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=33.2s)]
*  universe. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=42.28s)]
*  So it might be there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=43.28s)]
*  Physics calls it the Fermi paradox. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=45.8s)]
*  Enrico Fomey, who's an amazing physicist, asked the fundamental question, where are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=48.88s)]
*  the aliens? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=53.800000000000004s)]
*  A lot of people ask me, you know, where are the aliens? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  And I think if anyone would know about aliens on Earth, it would probably be me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=60.0s)]
*  I would think. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very familiar with space stuff. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  And I've seen no evidence of aliens. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=70.76s)]
*  So I would immediately tweet it out. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  I would be like, all time, probably the top tweet of all time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=76.56s)]
*  I found one, guys. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  This is a jackpot. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=83.84s)]
*  This is some 8 billion likes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  Next level jackpot if you find the aliens. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=89.76s)]
*  I don't think they're keeping this under, you know, and it was like some general, I [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=92.68s)]
*  think, in the 60s, where they say, show us the aliens, like, Aero 51, et cetera. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=98.72s)]
*  And he said, like, listen, we are constantly trying to get the defense budget to expand. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=104.2s)]
*  And you know what would really get no arguments for anyone? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=109.64s)]
*  If we pull out an alien and said, we need money to protect ourselves from these guys. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=113.56s)]
*  How much money do you want? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=119.72s)]
*  You got it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=120.86s)]
*  They look dangerous. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=121.86s)]
*  So the fastest way to get a defense budget increase would be for me to pull out an alien, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=124.86s)]
*  you know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=130.72s)]
*  We were like, yeah, I mean, that could be the invasion fleet could be arriving any minute. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=131.72s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=135.16s)]
*  So I digress. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=136.4s)]
*  But you were saying that our consciousness makes us unique in the universe so far as [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=141.6s)]
*  we know. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=145.76s)]
*  Yes, I'm not saying that we are unique. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=146.76s)]
*  I'm simply stating to the best of my knowledge that there is no evidence for other conscious [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=148.2s)]
*  life. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=152.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=153.48s)]
*  I hope there is, and I hope they're peaceful, obviously, two important characteristics. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=154.48s)]
*  But I'm just saying we haven't seen anything yet. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  But you think that we take our existence here for granted? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=166.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think there are threats to it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=169.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=171.48s)]
*  So I just think we should not assume that civilization is robust. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=172.76s)]
*  And if you look at the history of civilizations, the rise and fall of the ancient Egyptians, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  ancient Sumerians, Rome, you know, throughout the world, there have been rise and fall of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  many civilizations. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  So there's an arc, there's sort of a life cycle arc to civilizations, just as there [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=199.0s)]
*  is to individual humans. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=205.08s)]
*  And I think we just want to make sure that we have civilization go onward and upward. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  And that's, for example, why I'm concerned about decreasing birth rates and the fact [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=217.88s)]
*  that, for example, Japan had twice as many deaths last year as births. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=223.08s)]
*  So that's, and they're a leading indicator. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=227.76s)]
*  Can I say, and you've written and talked a lot about this, but can I ask you to pause [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=231.16s)]
*  just for a parenthetical note? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=235.44s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the urge to have sex and to procreate is, after breathing and eating, the most basic [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  urge. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=243.84s)]
*  How has it been subverted? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=244.84s)]
*  Well, it's just, in the past, we could rely upon, you know, simple limbic system rewards [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=246.48s)]
*  in order to procreate. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=254.8s)]
*  But once you have birth control and, you know, abortions and whatnot, now you can still satisfy [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=257.0s)]
*  limbic instinct, but not procreate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=264.72s)]
*  So we haven't yet evolved to deal with that, because this is all fairly recent, you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=268.24s)]
*  in the last 50 years or so for birth control. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=273.56s)]
*  You know, I'm sort of worried that, hey, civilization, you know, if we don't make enough people [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=276.56s)]
*  to at least sustain our numbers, perhaps increase a little bit, then civilization is going to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=281.4s)]
*  crumble. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=285.0s)]
*  This is the old question of like, will civilization end with a bang or a whimper? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=286.0s)]
*  Well, it's currently trying to end with a whimper in adult diapers, which is depressing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  as hell. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  The most depressing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=297.78s)]
*  I mean, seriously, yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=298.78s)]
*  War is less depressing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=300.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'd rather go out with a bang. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=301.84s)]
*  With your shoes on. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=303.88s)]
*  Yeah, more exciting. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=304.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=305.88s)]
*  Whatever you think of Elon Musk, he's one of the rare figures in this country, maybe [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=310.88s)]
*  around the world, who sticks to the fundamentals. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  How do we keep the human race going? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=318.44s)]
*  What's good for humanity and what's bad? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=320.76s)]
*  Those are the questions our leaders should be discussing, and instead they're lecturing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=323.8s)]
*  us about trans rights and systemic racism. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  So it's refreshing to hear it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=330.3s)]
*  We'd like to hear the entire thing, the full uninterrupted interview, every minute our [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  cameras were on, with Elon Musk, that's coming soon. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=335.14s)]
*  It's going up on Fox Nation tomorrow morning, and we highly recommend it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Frx4IMX_Sw&t=338.5s)]
