# Glenn Greenwald warns Tucker that the Biden admin is using tactics 'tyrants use'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84)
*  Glenn Greenwald is the host of System Update. He joins us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=0.0s)]
*  Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  I'm actually in some ways glad that they went after a group of people I, you know, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=5.8s)]
*  probably don't agree with on a lot of things because it just makes it so much clearer. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  This is not partisan. This guy is saying something the regime doesn't like and they're [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=13.32s)]
*  trying to put him in jail. How is this happening in America? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=17.22s)]
*  I think one of the critical things to remember is even before January 6th, the Biden [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=21.64s)]
*  administration said their priority is to launch a domestic war on terror, to take all the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=25.28s)]
*  tactics we used against Al Qaeda and ISIS and foreign terrorist groups and direct it inward [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  because they perceive that anti-establishment dissidents in America, like the person you just [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  showed, are the real enemy. And that's what this is about. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=40.44s)]
*  There's a foreign agents law that is supposed to be if you say things you don't really [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=43.6s)]
*  believe because some foreign government is paying you millions of dollars to say them, you [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  have to register. That's not the case with these people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=51.44s)]
*  These are people who have been radical black leftists for decades. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=54.0s)]
*  They're not the people the Democratic Party likes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=57.24s)]
*  They hate the Biden administration. They're against the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=58.92s)]
*  And they claim that they found five hundred dollars here, two thousand dollars there that have [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  origins in the Russian government for events they did. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=66.08s)]
*  This is what we criticize Russia for. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=69.16s)]
*  We fund opposition groups in Russia and then Russia says those are foreign agents. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  And we object and we say a foreign agent is only somebody saying things the government, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=75.48s)]
*  a foreign government tells them to say. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=79.64s)]
*  And now we're using that same theory. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=81.52s)]
*  We say Russia makes makes Russia tyrannical to criminalize dissent in the United States. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=83.32s)]
*  That's what this case is about. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  So what's interesting about this is these are not MAGA people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=90.0s)]
*  These are the victims of systemic racism. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=93.84s)]
*  They're always lecturing us about. Right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=96.24s)]
*  And their First Amendment rights have just been stripped. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=98.56s)]
*  And they're looking at jail terms for having opinions Biden doesn't like. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=100.92s)]
*  Where are the liberals? Where's Morning Joe? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=105.24s)]
*  We're all the sensitive white liberals to defend these people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=107.36s)]
*  They're not. Well, this is why. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=110.84s)]
*  Yeah, this is why I'm so glad you're covering this case, Tucker, because this is the tactic [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=112.48s)]
*  that tyrants always use when they want to implement an authoritarian precedent. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=115.92s)]
*  They choose people that makes others uncomfortable when they wanted to start banning people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=120.36s)]
*  from the Internet. They chose Milo Yiannopoulos and Alex Jones because they knew that even [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=124.4s)]
*  Republicans would say, I don't want to defend those people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=127.84s)]
*  They're they're a bridge too far. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=130.44s)]
*  And then the precedent gets set and they expand it inward. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=131.88s)]
*  Again, these are not people, the kind of black radicals, Democratic Party establishment [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=134.52s)]
*  representatives like they're people who attack the Biden administration, who don't vote [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=139.52s)]
*  Democrat. These are real dissidents and they know that not even Democrats will defend them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=143.36s)]
*  No, they're not taking money from Apple and Facebook. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=148.36s)]
*  They weren't in on the BLM scam. They actually mean it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Now you're making me like them. Glenn Greenwald, I appreciate your coming on tonight [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  and getting as you always do to the core issues underneath it all. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. Great to be with you, Tucker. Thanks. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGekTdtvT84&t=160.88s)]
