# Tucker's warning if Ukraine war continues
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, the war in Ukraine began a year ago today, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=2.0s)]
*  on February 24th, 2022, when the Russian military [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  rolled across the eastern border of that country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  But in many ways, the Russian invasion of Ukraine [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=12.0s)]
*  was the endpoint of a much longer story. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  The propaganda campaign designed to convince Americans [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=17.52s)]
*  to take sides in this conflict, a conflict that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=20.36s)]
*  has nothing strictly speaking to do with them or with America, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=23.16s)]
*  that effort began many years earlier. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=26.48s)]
*  We'd peg it to July 22nd, 2016. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=29.2s)]
*  That's the day that WikiLeaks published thousands of emails [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=32.72s)]
*  from the servers of the Democratic National [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=35.64s)]
*  Committee in Washington. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=37.32s)]
*  Those emails proved that party officials had rigged [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=39.16s)]
*  the democratic process, the primary process, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=42.04s)]
*  in favor of Hillary Clinton and against the insurgent populist [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=44.68s)]
*  candidate that year, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=47.92s)]
*  Within days, the chair of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=51.08s)]
*  resigned in disgrace. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=54.32s)]
*  The WikiLeaks scandal broke on the same day [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=56.32s)]
*  that Hillary Clinton chose her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=58.48s)]
*  and it overshadowed the nominating convention [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=61.72s)]
*  that followed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  But more significantly, the WikiLeaks scandal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=64.92s)]
*  threatened to split the Democratic Party into pieces. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=67.28s)]
*  More than 13 million Bernie Sanders voters, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  many of the young people, learned [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  that the process they had always believed in was, in fact, a sham. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  They had been cheated. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=78.44s)]
*  Democratic leaders had to act quickly in the face of this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=80.36s)]
*  to deflect blame from themselves onto someone else. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=82.88s)]
*  The DNC's servers, they claimed, had been hacked [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=86.48s)]
*  by the Russian military. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=88.92s)]
*  The goal was to hurt Hillary Clinton, whom the Russians feared [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=90.48s)]
*  for her strength and wisdom, and to help Donald Trump, whom [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=93.48s)]
*  they controlled. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=96.76s)]
*  Russia hacked the servers in order to hack the election. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=98.2s)]
*  That was their story. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=101.68s)]
*  The Washington Post ran with it the first day as if it were true. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=102.88s)]
*  But there was never any evidence that it was true. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Almost seven years later, there is still no evidence. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  The DNC's story about its servers is a lie. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  But as a political strategy, that lie worked flawlessly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=115.68s)]
*  Russia made the perfect villain. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=118.92s)]
*  It was a white, Christian country [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=120.64s)]
*  with a traditional social structure. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=122.2s)]
*  It was everything the Democratic Party already opposed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=123.76s)]
*  The foreign policy apparatus in Washington [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  was happy to hate Russia again. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=129.12s)]
*  After 40 years of Cold War, hating Russia was muscle memory. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=131.12s)]
*  So soon, the leaders of both parties in Washington [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=135.24s)]
*  signed on to the Russia collusion hoax. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  It had the twin benefits of paralyzing the Trump [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=140.28s)]
*  administration, which it did, and justifying the expansion [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=143.68s)]
*  of the national security state. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=146.28s)]
*  As the years passed and the rhetoric intensified, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  hysteria set in. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=151.12s)]
*  After a while, anybody with a heterodox opinion, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=152.88s)]
*  from right-wingers to avowed socialists, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=155.2s)]
*  could be accused of working secretly for Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=157.68s)]
*  Many were accused, and some were destroyed by it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=161.12s)]
*  It was a textbook witch hunt, far more [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=163.8s)]
*  effective than McCarthyism. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=165.68s)]
*  And unlike McCarthyism, it never ended. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=167.56s)]
*  Russia remained America's greatest enemy, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=170.72s)]
*  even as China emerged as America's greatest threat. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=173.4s)]
*  Over time, the lie that Democrats [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=177.48s)]
*  told to hide their crimes in the 2016 primaries [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=179.2s)]
*  came to dominate America's foreign policy, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=182.36s)]
*  and then to imperil America itself. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=184.96s)]
*  For generations, statesmen and diplomats [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=188.48s)]
*  worked to prevent other great powers from aligning [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=190.32s)]
*  as a bloc against the US. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=192.56s)]
*  The idea was pretty straightforward. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=195.0s)]
*  You might be able to beat one strong country, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=196.64s)]
*  but if a couple of strong countries ever got together, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=198.68s)]
*  you would lose. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  This is why Richard Nixon went to China [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=202.4s)]
*  to make sure the Chinese government didn't align [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=204.28s)]
*  with Brezhnev, with the Russians. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=206.68s)]
*  Donald Trump understood this very clearly. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=209.28s)]
*  Russia will never be our closest ally, he said, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=211.28s)]
*  but if Russia ever becomes China's ally, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=214.24s)]
*  we're in deep trouble. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=216.68s)]
*  The combination of natural resources, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=218.36s)]
*  military and economic power, and sheer population [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=220.24s)]
*  would make the Russian-Chinese alliance [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  the most powerful force in the world. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=225.12s)]
*  The United States would soon be dethroned. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=227.6s)]
*  We'd be taking orders. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=229.88s)]
*  As Trump put it, there is no reason to make Russia our enemy, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=231.88s)]
*  and there are many reasons not to. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=234.76s)]
*  It was a sound case, but official Washington ignored him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=237.48s)]
*  Their response shouted in unison, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=240.28s)]
*  shut up, Putin stooge. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=242.0s)]
*  And then they set about trying to provoke a war with Russia. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=244.04s)]
*  Now they have succeeded. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=247.0s)]
*  But the war we're fighting in Ukraine [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=248.72s)]
*  is not against Russia alone, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  but also against Russia's newest ally, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=251.84s)]
*  the People's Republic of China. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=253.84s)]
*  What Donald Trump predicted has happened, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=255.96s)]
*  and in the worst way. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=258.52s)]
*  If the war in Ukraine continues, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=260.16s)]
*  we will lose no matter how it ends. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=262.0s)]
*  The world order is being reshuffled as we watch, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=264.88s)]
*  and by the time it's over, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=267.64s)]
*  the U.S. will no longer be at the top of the deck. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=268.72s)]
*  That is very obvious to the rest of the world, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  but what's fascinating is how few Americans [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=274.16s)]
*  seem to understand what's happening or its consequences, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=276.16s)]
*  but how would they know? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=279.04s)]
*  No one in American politics or media will tell them the truth. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=280.68s)]
*  Since the first hours after the invasion, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=284.6s)]
*  Americans have been fed a steady diet [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=286.72s)]
*  of increasingly absurd lies about Ukraine. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=288.8s)]
*  Google and Facebook have joined with the Biden administration [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  to censor any factual information [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=294.68s)]
*  that contradicts the official storyline. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  It's dystopian. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=298.88s)]
*  Joe Biden's first remarks about the war [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=300.56s)]
*  gave no hint that we would be sending advanced weapons systems [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=302.48s)]
*  and American military advisors to Ukraine, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=305.8s)]
*  then supporting the entire Ukrainian government [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  and its pension system [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=310.48s)]
*  with hundreds of billions of U.S. tax dollars. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=312.04s)]
*  No, Joe Biden mentioned only sanctions, which are free. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=314.68s)]
*  Sanctions he suggested would be enough. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=318.36s)]
*  Here is Joe Biden a year ago today. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=320.6s)]
*  The Russian military has begun a brutal assault [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=323.72s)]
*  on the people of Ukraine. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=326.0s)]
*  Without provocation, without justification, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  without necessity, this aggression cannot go unanswered. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  America stands up to bullies. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=340.20000000000005s)]
*  We stand up for freedom. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=341.92s)]
*  Putin is the aggressor. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  Putin chose this war. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=346.88s)]
*  And now he and his country will bear the consequences. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  Today, I'm authorizing additional strong sanctions. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=352.92s)]
*  Strong sanctions. That'll do it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=357.0s)]
*  Now, the goal at that point a year ago today, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=359.8s)]
*  you may remember this, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=361.6s)]
*  was to push Russian forces back into their own country [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=362.64s)]
*  to reverse the invasion. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=365.68s)]
*  And that seemed reasonable to most people. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=367.56s)]
*  It did not seem like the beginning of a Third World War. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=369.44s)]
*  Oh, but it was exactly that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=372.76s)]
*  And by December, Lindsey Graham was confident enough [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=374.6s)]
*  to say so out loud. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=377.04s)]
*  Here he is. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=378.6s)]
*  How does this war end? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=380.2s)]
*  When Russia breaks and they take Putin out, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=381.76s)]
*  anything short of that, the war is going to continue. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=384.0s)]
*  To ask the Ukrainians to give Russia part of their country [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=386.56s)]
*  after all this death and destruction is not going to happen. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=389.76s)]
*  To signal a ceasefire, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=393.24s)]
*  Russia will take the opportunity to rearm [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=395.64s)]
*  and come at them again. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=397.88s)]
*  So we're in it to win it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=399.24s)]
*  And the only way you're going to win it [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  is to break the Russian military [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=402.16s)]
*  and have somebody in Russia take Putin out. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=403.88s)]
*  So we're going to, says Lindsey Graham confidently, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=407.88s)]
*  continue pouring billions into Ukraine [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=410.76s)]
*  until they, quote, take Putin out. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=412.92s)]
*  Does Putin know this? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=416.32s)]
*  Well, we have no idea. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  We're not allowed to see Russian media in this country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=419.0s)]
*  That's too much information for Americans to handle. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=421.56s)]
*  But if Putin does know that we plan to kill him, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=424.6s)]
*  wouldn't he fight back with nuclear weapons? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=427.64s)]
*  Why wouldn't he fight back with nuclear weapons? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=429.96s)]
*  No one in the United States seems to be allowed to wonder that, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  much less have a conversation about it out loud. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=435.28s)]
*  Instead, we're treated to more lectures about democracy. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine is a democracy, we're told. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=440.8s)]
*  That's why we're on the side of Ukraine. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  The problem is that is a lie. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=444.8s)]
*  Ukraine is not a democracy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=446.32s)]
*  Ukraine is a corrupt one-party state. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine has none of the freedoms [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  that define democratic governance. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=451.8s)]
*  Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=453.84s)]
*  freedom of assembly, freedom of religion. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=455.8s)]
*  Ukraine is the least free place in all of Europe. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=458.68s)]
*  And probably for that reason, it is Joe Biden's favorite place. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=461.64s)]
*  So for those who understand what is actually happening [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=465.6s)]
*  and what Ukraine is actually like, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=468.24s)]
*  it is very frustrating to watch Biden say this again and again. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=469.76s)]
*  It is galling to be lectured about democracy [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=473.8s)]
*  by a man who took power in an election so sketchy [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=476.76s)]
*  that many Americans don't believe it was even real. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=479.88s)]
*  Joe Biden has never had the majority of American support [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=482.88s)]
*  for a single day of the Ukraine War. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=486.11999999999995s)]
*  In fact, Joe Biden is far less popular in the United States [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  than Vladimir Putin is in Russia. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=492.11999999999995s)]
*  That is not an endorsement of Putin, it's just true. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=494.44s)]
*  And it says everything about Joe Biden's tenuous legitimacy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  Democracy? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=501.35999999999996s)]
*  Please, we're adults, stop lying to us. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=502.79999999999995s)]
*  So what happens next in this war? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=506.96s)]
*  Well, according to our elderly Treasury Secretary, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=509.32s)]
*  the war in Ukraine will go on forever. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  And so will our support for Zelensky. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=514.96s)]
*  Let me make clear, the United States and the allies, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=518.12s)]
*  our support for Ukraine will be lasting and is unconditional. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=523.28s)]
*  Unconditional support for Ukraine. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=530.76s)]
*  Unconditional support for a nation most Americans [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  know nothing about and couldn't find on a map. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=537.36s)]
*  Unconditional support. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=540.16s)]
*  That's a profound statement. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=542.36s)]
*  Outside of your immediate family, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  how many people would you pledge unconditional support to? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=545.92s)]
*  How many countries would you pledge unconditional support to? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=549.76s)]
*  This is insane when you think about it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=554.1999999999999s)]
*  But the people in charge of this disaster [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  aren't thinking the way that most Americans do. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=558.56s)]
*  The Atlantic Magazine commemorated the anniversary [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=561.12s)]
*  of the war by commissioning a piece today by Tom Nichols. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  Nichols is a thoroughly silly foreign policy establishment [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=566.64s)]
*  parasite who apparently is taken seriously [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=569.28s)]
*  by other ne'er-do-wells and dumb people in Washington. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=571.6s)]
*  But the piece is fascinating. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=574.76s)]
*  In it, he inadvertently reveals the point of this war [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=576.12s)]
*  in the clearest possible terms. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=579.52s)]
*  Quote, now we are faced with the long grind [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=581.04s)]
*  of defeating Moscow's armies and eventually [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=585.48s)]
*  rebuilding a better world. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=587.92s)]
*  Oh, defeating Moscow's armies and building a better world? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=594.6s)]
*  Thank you, Tom Nichols. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=595.0s)]
*  Adding those items to this week's to-do list. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=596.12s)]
*  Unspecified in the piece is exactly how we plan to do this, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=599.32s)]
*  how we plan to defeat Russia and its ally China [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=602.08s)]
*  and then build utopia. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=604.72s)]
*  The piece is notably light on details. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=606.36s)]
*  Now, you'd feel a little better hearing all this [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=609.16s)]
*  if Tom Nichols and others like him in Washington [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=610.92s)]
*  had a track record that suggested they could do any of this, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=613.28s)]
*  a track record of competence and success. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=616.16s)]
*  They don't. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=618.88s)]
*  Nichols himself seems to spend most of his life [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=620.0s)]
*  arguing with other people on Twitter. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=622.0s)]
*  He's never achieved anything at all that we're aware of. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=624.04s)]
*  But then virtually none of them have achieved anything. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=626.88s)]
*  Biden's chief Ukraine strategist, Toria Nuland? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=630.24s)]
*  You would not hire her to plan spring break. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=632.8s)]
*  She couldn't do it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=635.24s)]
*  She doesn't have the skills. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=636.08s)]
*  Now, these very same people, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=637.64s)]
*  these demonstrably incompetent people, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=639.88s)]
*  say they plan to rebuild a better world. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=642.2s)]
*  All right, that seems ambitious. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=646.36s)]
*  How about starting with Baltimore? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=648.48s)]
*  Before moving on to total global transformation, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=650.28s)]
*  shouldn't we fix the biggest city in Maryland first? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=652.76s)]
*  Under the leadership of people like Tom Nichols [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=656.44s)]
*  and Toria Nuland, neoliberal geniuses with grand plans, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  Baltimore has devolved into third world chaos. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=662.5200000000001s)]
*  But then so has Iraq, and so has Libya, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  and so has every other place [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=667.5200000000001s)]
*  these people have decided to quote, rebuild. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=669.2800000000001s)]
*  It should spur a moment of silence and self-reflection [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=672.6400000000001s)]
*  in the US State Department [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=675.24s)]
*  that the moment Western diplomats and NGOs left the country, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=676.6400000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan got safer. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=680.4000000000001s)]
*  There are far fewer killings in Kabul now [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=683.36s)]
*  than there were 18 months ago. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=685.52s)]
*  Pedestrians in Kabul could walk to dinner at night [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=686.96s)]
*  without being murdered. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=689.24s)]
*  Now, that fact doesn't tell the whole story [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=690.92s)]
*  of Afghanistan, of course, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=692.64s)]
*  but we shouldn't ignore that fact. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=695.0799999999999s)]
*  It means something. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=696.92s)]
*  If you spend billions trying to make a place better [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=698.48s)]
*  and it gets worse, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=701.24s)]
*  you have an obligation to think about why. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=703.04s)]
*  Maybe you're doing it wrong. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=705.52s)]
*  Maybe you're not as powerful and clever [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=707.0799999999999s)]
*  as you thought you were. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=709.04s)]
*  Maybe there's a problem with your formula, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=710.52s)]
*  but none of this ever occurs to people like Tom Nichols [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=713.36s)]
*  and Toria Nuland, and for that matter, Joe Biden. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=716.4s)]
*  The more discredited they are, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=718.96s)]
*  the more self-confident they become. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=721.08s)]
*  They see every failure as evidence [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=723.96s)]
*  that their talents are more desperately needed than ever. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=726.12s)]
*  What is this? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=729.76s)]
*  Well, it's called hubris. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=731.2s)]
*  Hubris is the delusion that causes people [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=733.08s)]
*  to mistake themselves for God. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=735.4s)]
*  They imagine they have power and wisdom and foresight [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=737.76s)]
*  that they don't actually possess, that no human does. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=740.64s)]
*  Hubris is a species of mental illness. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=744.08s)]
*  These people are unwell. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=746.44s)]
*  They're crazy, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=748.16s)]
*  and there's nothing more dangerous than that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=749.5600000000001s)]
*  Hubris has caused more suffering than polio. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=751.64s)]
*  It's caused more deaths than smallpox, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=754.16s)]
*  and apparently we're in the middle of another epidemic of it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I5mrWipls&t=756.8000000000001s)]
