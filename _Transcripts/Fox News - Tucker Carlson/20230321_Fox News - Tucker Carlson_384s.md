# Michael Cohen's former legal adviser throws doubt on his credibility
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo)
*  Robert Costello was legal advisor to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=0.0s)]
*  made the payment to Stormy Daniels. He joins us tonight. Mr. Costello, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=4.74s)]
*  So as noted, we can't know whether there'll be an indictment or what's in it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=9.1s)]
*  But from the leaks that you have read and say the New York Times, how do you assess this case? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  A week to say the least. I just spent two hours or so testifying before the grand jury in downtown Manhattan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=18.7s)]
*  And I got my point across, although it was clear to me that the Manhattan DA's office did not want to get to the truth. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=27.4s)]
*  I need to explain that a little bit. I called them up after I saw Michael Cohen on TV stating things that he said he was going to tell the grand jury and had told the grand jury [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=35.599999999999994s)]
*  that were contrary to what he told us when we first represented him in April of 2018. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  So I'm sitting at home watching these lies and I said, I've got to do something about it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=54.4s)]
*  I don't represent Donald Trump, but I do stand for justice and I think I have a legal obligation to inform both sides. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=58.7s)]
*  So that's what I did. I had a ton of documents that I had prepared back in 2019 for the Department of Justice. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=65.8s)]
*  The U.S. Attorney's Office called me up and said, Mr. Costello, we would like to talk to you about your representation of Michael Cohen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=74.2s)]
*  I laughed and said, can I presume you have a waiver of the attorney client privilege? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=82.0s)]
*  And they said, you presume correctly. I said, fine, send it over. I'll be delighted to talk to you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=87.5s)]
*  That waiver is very clear. And once we had that, I prepared 330 emails, a bunch of text messages. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=93.2s)]
*  I prepared a contemporaneous report of our first meeting with Michael Cohen at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=103.6s)]
*  as well as a contemporaneous notes of the interview I had for two hours with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of York, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=110.5s)]
*  as well as contemporaneous notes of an interview by the House Committee on Intelligence, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=117.9s)]
*  who sent three investigators to my office, one of whom is now Dan Goldman, a congressman here in New York. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=122.9s)]
*  So I had all of this material ready. I sent it to Donald Trump's lawyer and I sent it to the Manhattan DA's office. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=129.7s)]
*  And I contacted the Manhattan DA's office and I asked, could we meet with Alvin Bragg? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=136.2s)]
*  Because I wanted to present this to Alvin Bragg as I had presented it to the Southern District. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=140.7s)]
*  I wanted him to look me in the eye and assess my credibility. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=145.5s)]
*  Did I have more credibility than Michael Cohen? Because Michael Cohen, in my opinion, was lying about just about everything. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=149.1s)]
*  I specifically told them that there were two main points that I wanted to make clear, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=156.8s)]
*  that Cohen had told us that when we first met him, that he was suicidal. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=161.5s)]
*  Why is that important? Because when you're suicidal, thinking that that's the only way out of your legal mess, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=166.8s)]
*  and you're presented with the following options, that you can cooperate against Donald Trump [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  and provide information that would get you a get out of jail free card, and you respond to us, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  I do not have any information on Donald Trump. And he said it many times during that two hour meeting, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=185.4s)]
*  I swear to God, Bob, I don't have anything on Donald Trump. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=191.4s)]
*  And I had my law partner who knew Michael Cohen for 10 years on Columbia Grammar and Prep School here in Manhattan [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=194.5s)]
*  because Cohen was on the board of directors. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=201.3s)]
*  And when I heard him say that he was suicidal the weekend before standing on the roof of the Regency Hotel, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=204.4s)]
*  I didn't know whether he was a drama queen or telling the truth. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  So I looked at my partner and he shook his head and nodded, I think he's telling the truth. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=213.4s)]
*  And later on, we got that corroborated by the Reverend Jerry Falwell and his wife, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=218.4s)]
*  who had dinner with Michael Cohen, who told him the same thing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  Why is that important? Because when you're willing to give up your life in order to avoid these legal troubles, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=226.0s)]
*  when they're insurmountable to you and you're offered a way out, you say, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=231.9s)]
*  all you have to do is cooperate on Donald Trump. Do you have anything on Donald Trump? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=235.8s)]
*  And he says, no, repeatedly, I swear to God, Bob, I don't have anything. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  Then you know that you've got a guy who probably doesn't have anything. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=245.2s)]
*  It's certainly easier to give up information on Donald Trump than it is to kill yourself. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=249.2s)]
*  On top of that, while he's making these speeches during two hour period, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=254.7s)]
*  he's marching up and down on the other side of the conference table like a tiger in the zoo, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=258.7s)]
*  back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. He looked like he hadn't slept in five days. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=263.4s)]
*  He looked like somebody who was suicidal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=268.20000000000005s)]
*  And every once in a while, he would stop and point at us. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=270.6s)]
*  When I say once in a while, he did this at least 20 times and said, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  guys, I want you to know, I will do whatever the f I have to do. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=278.6s)]
*  I will never spend one day in jail. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  Now, what he's saying is I'll lie, cheat, steal, shoot somebody. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=285.8s)]
*  I will not spend a day in jail. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=290.0s)]
*  Do you think a guy whose mentality is that, is going to not admit that he has information on Donald Trump? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  But having said that, the DA's office didn't ask me questions to bring that up. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=298.3s)]
*  And I brought it up anyway. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=304.5s)]
*  I ignored their questions and simply gave them the information. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=307.0s)]
*  I'm hearing rap in my ear, left and right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=312.5s)]
*  I'll continue if you want. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=315.5s)]
*  Let me just ask you one final question, if it's okay, Mr. Cosell. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=318.20000000000005s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=321.0s)]
*  If you were the DA, if you were a prosecutor and you were trying to be fair and honest and serve the law rather than a political agenda, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=321.8s)]
*  you'd want to know that, wouldn't you? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=329.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  And I told them and told the grand jury today, I was deputy chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorneys for the Southern District. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  I said, I wouldn't touch a witness like Michael Cohn for any amount of money. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=338.3s)]
*  You simply cannot rely upon this guy. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  And tonight he was on another station denying that he waived the attorney-client privilege. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=344.6s)]
*  Here it is, in writing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=350.2s)]
*  And that's his signature on the second page. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=352.2s)]
*  So I guess he didn't know that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=354.4s)]
*  And the district attorney didn't know that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=356.8s)]
*  And I told them, Michael Cohn has been in your office 20 times and twice in the grand jury. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=359.3s)]
*  And he forgot to tell you that he waived the attorney-client privilege 22 times. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=364.6s)]
*  I mean, really, is this the kind of witness you want to ride to the finish line? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=370.2s)]
*  Not in my book. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=374.4s)]
*  I think all they care about is the finish line. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=375.4s)]
*  But I sure appreciate the information that you brought us tonight. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=377.29999999999995s)]
*  You're quite welcome. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=380.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=381.5s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=382.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IJdfGtyXo&t=383.5s)]
