# Johns Hopkins University surgeon breaks down the science behind abortions
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyVvYBo0m5E)
*  Dr. Marty McCary is at Johns Hopkins University of Public Health. He joins us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyVvYBo0m5E&t=0.0s)]
*  Dr. thanks so much for coming on. It'd be interesting to kind of take the politics out of it, Roe v. Way out of it, whether it should be legal or not out of it. Just to the science of it. We know that children in utero, fetuses, whatever you call them, the developing human being in utero feels pain, correct? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyVvYBo0m5E&t=4.26s)]
*  That's right, Tucker. Somewhere between 15 and 20 weeks, babies will actually resist the instruments of abortion. Now Roe is based on viability, but viability has been changing. Babies survived now at approximately the halfway point of pregnancy. At 21 and 22 weeks, babies have survived outside the womb. So ironically, we sometimes do fetal surgery on a baby inside the womb of the mother to save the baby's life. And yet at the same age, babies are still in the womb. So we're going to have to do a little bit of a research on that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyVvYBo0m5E&t=18.88s)]
*  So there's a great irony and now you can barely talk about it. I witnessed it as a medical student. I'll tell you, it doesn't matter which side you protest on around this issue. If you see the actual images of what's happening and a baby resisting an abortion, it'll weigh on your conscience. But today you can barely talk about it. Nurses can get fired if they don't participate. Students are ridiculed. Most of the professional medical associations have taken up the opportunity to say, well, you know, we're going to have to do a little bit of research on that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyVvYBo0m5E&t=48.88s)]
*  It's beyond belief and it does nothing to restore confidence in the medical profession. No offense to physicians like yourself, but it doesn't, I must say. Dr. Marty McCary, I appreciate your coming on again. Thank you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyVvYBo0m5E&t=73.88s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyVvYBo0m5E&t=103.88s)]
