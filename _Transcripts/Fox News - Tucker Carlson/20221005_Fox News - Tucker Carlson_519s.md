# Tony Bobulinski on sharing evidence with the FBI on Hunter Biden
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ)
*  Government officials are not allowed to sell access to the United States government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Even sitting vice presidents like Joe Biden are not allowed to do that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=8.16s)]
*  It's a crime. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=11.84s)]
*  It is also a crime for anyone in the United States to commit fraud, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  to defraud their business partners. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=17.48s)]
*  Now, in the portion of interview that you just saw, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=19.88s)]
*  Tony Bobulinski presented evidence, which we examined, that Hunter Biden did this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=22.0s)]
*  He committed fraud against Tony Bobulinski and his other business partners. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=28.64s)]
*  The Biden family did that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=33.24s)]
*  Now, Bobulinski gave that evidence to the FBI. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=34.88s)]
*  What happened next? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=38.56s)]
*  We asked Tony Bobulinski. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=39.72s)]
*  Now, since you are at the very center of the story, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=43.04s)]
*  since you were the CEO of Sine Hawk Holdings... [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=45.32s)]
*  I wish I wasn't. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=47.96s)]
*  Right? I know. I know that's right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=48.96s)]
*  And I want to ask you about that in a minute because it's a sad story. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=50.88s)]
*  But since you are, as a factual matter, at the very center of this story, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=54.24s)]
*  tell us about your personal interactions with the FBI. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=58.92s)]
*  So, you know, well documented, I went to the second debate in Nashville [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=63.96s)]
*  between President Trump and Joe Biden. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  My son has not made money in terms of this thing about... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  What are you talking about? China. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=76.76s)]
*  I have not had... The only guy who made money from China is this guy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=78.76s)]
*  He's the only one. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=82.88s)]
*  Nobody else has made money from China. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=84.04s)]
*  That night I flew to D.C. and the next morning there was a big debate, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=86.2s)]
*  do I voluntarily walk into the FBI [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  or do I go sit down with Senator Johnson and Senator Grassley? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=92.68s)]
*  My lawyers decided it was better that I voluntarily go in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=96.4s)]
*  to sit and provide these facts. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=100.2s)]
*  And so in the morning of October 23rd, the morning after the debate, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  I spent five plus hours sitting in a room with at one point, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=107.0s)]
*  I think as much as six federal agents walking through all the facts [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  of my knowledge of the Biden family, how I got involved in this, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=115.12s)]
*  the trips around the world, CFC, Chairman Yee and stuff like that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  At the end of that meeting, and remember I voluntarily went there, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=126.28s)]
*  so they were happy to take any information I provided to them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  I wish I had pictures of the faces of the two main agents [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=134.24s)]
*  that were interviewing me because I would say something [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=137.44s)]
*  and you could just see the shock in their face. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  And they would say, hey, let's take them in. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  And they'd get up and walk out of the room. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=146.32s)]
*  And the agents would sort of convene and then come back and restart the interview. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  Because these facts are just for the sake of our country, for national security. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=152.72s)]
*  At that point, he was candidate Joe Biden. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=157.92s)]
*  Now he's the sitting president of the United States, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=160.56s)]
*  the most powerful person in the free world and daunting. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  So at the end of that five plus hour interview, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=167.88s)]
*  the head of station told my lawyers, listen, an individual named Tim Tebow [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=170.44s)]
*  is going to run points on all of this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=175.68s)]
*  We're definitely going to have Tony come back in for a follow up interview. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=177.4s)]
*  Could be as early as next week. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  Some of the people that were in the room weren't well versed on all these facts. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=182.8s)]
*  We may want to have people come in from Baltimore or Delaware. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=186.76s)]
*  And, you know, I was ready to sit down with anybody that needed me to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=190.24s)]
*  or travel wherever I wanted to. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=193.88s)]
*  And and so the head of station gave my lawyers Tim Tebow cell phone number. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=195.92s)]
*  Tim was not there that day. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=201.04s)]
*  I think he was out of Washington, D.C. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  But my lawyers had an hour, hour and a half call with him that Friday night, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=205.6s)]
*  October 23rd, and subsequent calls through the weekend and the following week [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=209.16s)]
*  when I was then coming on your show to provide the facts to the American people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=214.16s)]
*  And they were supposed to be working a follow up interview. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=220.64s)]
*  And Tim Tebow in his last discussion with my legal counsel was, listen, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=224.64s)]
*  we know Tony's cooperating. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  We appreciate all the information he's provided. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=229.72s)]
*  We will follow up with you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=232.44s)]
*  We're definitely going to have him come in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=233.88s)]
*  for a follow up interview or spend some more time on this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  And I haven't heard from them since. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=238.64s)]
*  At all? No. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=241.6s)]
*  Nor have my lawyers. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=243.88s)]
*  No communication whatsoever. No. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  Since before the 2020 election. Correct. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Shocking. Yeah, that's would be one adjective. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=253.72s)]
*  Tell us about Tim Tebow. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=255.88s)]
*  I didn't interact with him. My lawyers did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=258.6s)]
*  And had extensive discussions, obviously. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=260.56s)]
*  All this information, very sensitive [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=263.24s)]
*  and how it was being handled. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=266.12s)]
*  The images off my cell phones, detailed, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=268.56s)]
*  you know, we chat discussions with the Chinese, you know, wires change. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=272.32s)]
*  Just the amount of information here is staggering. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=276.72s)]
*  And the FBI took possession of that information. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=280.64s)]
*  They did. I don't know where it went. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=282.64s)]
*  So I do know, you know, to your point earlier of one of the reasons [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=286.36s)]
*  why I'm sitting here, you know, during the summer, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  there's been all this discussion now about whistleblowers coming forward, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=293.28s)]
*  coming forward to Senator Grassley, Senator Johnson, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=296.44s)]
*  Congressman Jordan, Congresswoman Comer. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=300.84s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like they're coming out, you know, out of the woodwork. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=303.08s)]
*  And I think it will continue to accelerate. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  And apparently a variety of these whistleblowers [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=308.68s)]
*  claim that Tim Tebow was suppressing facts. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=311.28s)]
*  So imagine I'm actually in Europe traveling and I'm starting to see these, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, I call my lawyers monthly. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  Why haven't I been called in front of a grand jury? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=319.11999999999995s)]
*  This makes no sense to me. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  They said they were going to follow up within a week and do follow up interviews. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  And my lawyers are just, you know, you know, let the process work through. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  I respect for obviously our country. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  I was trying to respect the Department of Justice and let them through. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=332.96s)]
*  But then when you hear the person that you're told was assigned [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  to run point on thousands of documents and text messages [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=339.68s)]
*  and calendars and, you know, travel arrangements and all that, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=345.36s)]
*  that that individual just walked out of the, you know, the FBI headquarters in D.C. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=349.68s)]
*  He's got to start asking questions. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=355.52s)]
*  So and the allegation is that he's a partisan actor acting on behalf of, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=357.36s)]
*  effectively, the Democratic Party. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=361.88s)]
*  That's the allegation about it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=363.12s)]
*  Apparently, multiple whistleblowers have come forward and claimed that. Correct. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  Would you speak to the FBI again? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=367.2s)]
*  I'd be happy to. At any time? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=369.28s)]
*  At any time. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=371.4s)]
*  No, not just the FBI, the U.S. attorney. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=372.84s)]
*  I mean, these facts are extensive, well documented, easily verified [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=376.2s)]
*  metadata, multiple sources saying the same thing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=381.0s)]
*  Sure. Zero chance that this has anything to do with Russia or disinformation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=384.24s)]
*  So we've heard repeatedly accounts that there is or was a grand [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  journey jury impaneled in Delaware. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=394.16s)]
*  Yeah. What do you know about that? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  I know one thing I haven't been called in front of them and which is [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=401.0s)]
*  surprising, disappointing. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. You were the business partner of the Biden family. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBLRrhPrMOQ&t=407.84000000000003s)]
