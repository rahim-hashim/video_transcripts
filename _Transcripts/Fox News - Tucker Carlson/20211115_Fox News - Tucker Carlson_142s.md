# Tucker examines Kamala Harris' rise to power
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 15, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw)
*  So the one thing we know for sure about Kamala Harris is we should all be very, very grateful [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=0.0s)]
*  to have her because she's historic for reasons that no one ever explains. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  But there's a lot we don't know about Kamala Harris. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=12.44s)]
*  Most people probably don't know she really grew up in Canada. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=14.68s)]
*  That's where she went to high school. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=16.28s)]
*  She's not from this country in that sense, or she's certainly also from Canada. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Okay, didn't know that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=24.28s)]
*  Doesn't mean she's not going to be a good vice president, but why haven't we heard that? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=25.28s)]
*  By the way, how did someone who clearly is not liked by the people around her and clearly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=28.36s)]
*  isn't very good at her job get so high up? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, we know her first meaningful job in politics was given to her by her boyfriend [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=39.28s)]
*  at the time who was married, Willie Brown, the most powerful Democrat in California. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=43.76s)]
*  But we know that Willie Brown is not the only powerful person she dated. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  And this is pretty interesting. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  We're not exactly sure what to make of it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  But it turns out that Kamala Harris also dated the tabloid TV show host Montel Williams, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=53.48s)]
*  who's always doing shows about people's weird sex lives. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  We know that because of this video. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=62.64s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=64.72s)]
*  Long before she met Doug Emhoff, she dated some prominent men, including in 2001, former [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=65.72s)]
*  talk show host Montel Williams. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=71.56s)]
*  Back then, he was the famous one and had to introduce her to the paparazzi. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=74.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=78.8s)]
*  Stacy! [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=80.28s)]
*  Kamala. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=81.28s)]
*  So we know that Montel Williams called her Kamala. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=83.28s)]
*  We also know she calls herself Kamala sometimes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  But that's kind of all we know. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=88.32s)]
*  So what was that relationship like? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=89.96s)]
*  What did Montel Williams think of it? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=91.6s)]
*  So we would love to talk to Montel Williams about his torrid relationship with Kamala [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=93.12s)]
*  or Kamala, because that might be one of those blanks we'd like to fill in. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=98.16s)]
*  Anyway, he is always welcome on this show. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Meantime, we know that Kamala Harris having some problems as vice president. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=105.88s)]
*  CNN has just published this report. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=110.72s)]
*  And by the way, they spent a long time telling us how great she is and how thrilled we should [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=112.32s)]
*  be to have her. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=116.12s)]
*  But now they're telling us, this is the name of the piece, exasperation and dysfunction [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=117.12s)]
*  inside Kamala Harris's frustrating start as vice president. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=120.92s)]
*  In other words, it's kind of a disaster, which they told us that earlier. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=124.32s)]
*  And most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGI7HHwDpw&t=135.72s)]
