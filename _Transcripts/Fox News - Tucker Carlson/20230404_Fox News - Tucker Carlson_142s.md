# Candace Owens: This is incredibly despairing
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg)
*  We are joined by Candace Owens, the host of Candace, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=0.0s)]
*  and we're always happy to have her. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=2.64s)]
*  Candace, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=3.56s)]
*  It does seem like, and our continuing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=5.32s)]
*  is one of these ideas, you know, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=6.92s)]
*  that some political thoughts were thought up [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=8.76s)]
*  a long time ago, but I don't think it could be clear [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=10.0s)]
*  that's what we're watching. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=13.56s)]
*  Absolutely, and I will say this about this cultural demise [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=16.56s)]
*  that we're facing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=18.96s)]
*  I know people are understandably outraged, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=19.8s)]
*  people are understandably anger, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=21.36s)]
*  but I also want to comment on just the overwhelming despair [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=22.84s)]
*  and sadness that all of this is making me feel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  And I know that so many people at home [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=27.52s)]
*  are feeling the exact same way, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=29.2s)]
*  not just about America's present, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  feeling bleak about the future, dystopian nightmare [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  that we're currently existing in, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=34.54s)]
*  but also looking backward, you know? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=36.2s)]
*  One of the things that I think a lot of us are feeling [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  is disillusionment with what American justice [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=40.0s)]
*  is even about. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=43.44s)]
*  We've spent the better half of the last century [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=44.32s)]
*  entering in other countries, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  saying that we have a right to be here [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=47.84s)]
*  because we're spreading quote unquote democracy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=49.08s)]
*  We've completely lost the moral high ground. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=51.44s)]
*  I'm not sure if we ever really had it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  We have a right to be in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=55.06s)]
*  because we have better, our principles are better, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=57.6s)]
*  because these people are criminals, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  because these people are terrorists, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  because these people have the wrong ideas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=62.88s)]
*  Now all of a sudden our government [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=64.84s)]
*  is turning that same ideology [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  against the American people, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=67.72s)]
*  Now we have the wrong ideas. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=69.48s)]
*  Now we are the domestic terrorists. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Now we are the people that need to understand [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=73.04s)]
*  that criminality is allowed to fly. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=74.86s)]
*  And so it's incredibly despairing, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=76.76s)]
*  and I just want to speak on that first and foremost, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=78.6s)]
*  to look and say that overseas we used to talk about [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  how these terrorists were locking up [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=84.12s)]
*  their political dissidents. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=85.8s)]
*  Now we're doing exactly the same thing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=87.12s)]
*  We're locking up grandmas in the Capitol building. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=88.88s)]
*  We're putting people in prison for years [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=91.28s)]
*  for the offense of trespassing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=93.92s)]
*  We are now locking up a political contender. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=95.96s)]
*  You're saying Donald Trump must be arraigned. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=98.08s)]
*  We can't tell you why, but we're gonna issue a gag order. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=99.88s)]
*  If any of this took place overseas, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=102.1s)]
*  could you imagine what the response would be [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=104.84s)]
*  when we'd be demanding boots on the ground tomorrow [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=106.52s)]
*  to spread democracy? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=108.8s)]
*  But here, they completely overlook it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=110.32s)]
*  Calling attacks on the existing system hate speech, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=113.12s)]
*  which is a completely fake and made up category. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=117.88s)]
*  If you eliminate free speech, you don't have democracy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=120.7s)]
*  Democracy requires free speech or it doesn't exist. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=123.44s)]
*  And we would know that if it were happening [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=125.76s)]
*  in a foreign country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  You're so right, Candace. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  Appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWLh4f81Azg&t=131.0s)]
