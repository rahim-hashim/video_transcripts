# Medical expert's guidelines to preventing obesity among America's youth
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk)
*  Well, here's kind of an amazing story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=0.0s)]
*  So the American Academy of Pediatrics, which if you've got kids, you kind of trust, apparently, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=2.4s)]
*  has issued new guidance on obesity. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=7.48s)]
*  And you don't want to think that any medical association exists to make money for drug [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=9.36s)]
*  companies, but you have to kind of wonder in light of the American Academy of Pediatrics' [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=12.72s)]
*  new guidelines for childhood obesity. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=18.04s)]
*  Now, anyone who's tried to lose weight, we can speak to this directly, no, stop eating [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=20.2s)]
*  a lot of sugary food and you'll probably lose weight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=24.84s)]
*  But that's not the guidance. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=26.6s)]
*  They're saying the kids as young as 13 years old should take weight loss medication and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=28.28s)]
*  potentially undergo surgery for children. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=34.18s)]
*  Dr. Mark Siegel joins us tonight to assess this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=36.64s)]
*  Hey, doctor. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=39.24s)]
*  Tucker, this is the first time they've put out guidelines on obesity in 15 years with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=40.24s)]
*  15 million children from 2 to 19 obese. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=45.32s)]
*  But that's before the pandemic. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=49.92s)]
*  And these guidelines do read like panic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=51.72s)]
*  clinical practice guidelines. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=54.8s)]
*  I don't follow rigidly any clinical practice guidelines, period. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=56.48s)]
*  I don't doctor by the numbers. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=60.64s)]
*  You know, I listen to the patient. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=62.68s)]
*  I don't fat shame, by the way. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=64.08s)]
*  I talk to patients. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=65.48s)]
*  I listen to what they're sensitive to. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=66.76s)]
*  I want to know what their concerns are. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=68.4s)]
*  Are you depressed? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=70.28s)]
*  Why are you eating so much? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=71.28s)]
*  Are you sedentary? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=72.6s)]
*  Guess what the pandemic did? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=73.6s)]
*  Took kids away from schools where they had nutrition programs, locked them down where [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=75.4s)]
*  they lie on the couch all day, no exercise. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=79.64s)]
*  You're not allowed to go out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=82.0s)]
*  Well, guess what now happens? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=83.44s)]
*  They're burgeoning in weight. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=85.16s)]
*  So what do they do now? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  They need jerk a solution. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=88.16s)]
*  I know we'll give you a pill. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=89.44s)]
*  Oh, that doesn't work. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=91.24s)]
*  We'll do surgery that might have long term complications to it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  Why don't we do that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  Well, I have a prescription instead of all of that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=97.64s)]
*  I want to acknowledge that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=100.56s)]
*  And I want to go back to the beginning. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=101.88s)]
*  I have my own guidelines. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=103.72s)]
*  Dr. Siegel's guidelines. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  You introduce vegetables to your diet. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  You introduce it to your kids diet. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  You take you go on a walk. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=111.52s)]
*  You take your kid on a walk. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=112.68s)]
*  You have them exercise. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=114.76s)]
*  You ride a bike. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=115.84s)]
*  You have them ride a bike. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=116.84s)]
*  And then you challenge them at the end of the night, Tucker. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  You say, watch Tucker Carlson tonight and see if it challenges your brain. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=120.48s)]
*  Tucker? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=125.84s)]
*  I mean, getting rid of pizza and Oreos, speaking for myself, I do love. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=126.84s)]
*  I mean, that kind of goes a long way. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  Like, why not just say that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's so nuts. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=134.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=136.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=137.32s)]
*  Pizza and Oreos. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=138.32s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=139.32s)]
*  And exercise. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=140.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=141.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM89WbQ_vyk&t=142.32s)]
