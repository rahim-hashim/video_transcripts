# Elon Musk: Things are getting weird fast
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M)
*  The only advantage human beings have or have ever had is they're the smartest beings on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=0.0s)]
*  the planet. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=8.6s)]
*  But soon that will not be true. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=9.6s)]
*  In fact, like next week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  So when AI becomes stronger than we are, what do you do exactly and what does it mean for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=13.24s)]
*  democracy? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=17.6s)]
*  We asked Elon Musk about contingency plans for dealing with advanced general intelligence. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=18.6s)]
*  Here's part of that conversation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=23.28s)]
*  You've heard people say we should just blow up the server farms because there's no way [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=27.68s)]
*  to once this gets rolling, there's no way to slow it down. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=30.96s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=34.8s)]
*  Well, the the really heavy duty intelligence is not going to be distributed all over the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=36.44s)]
*  place. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=41.76s)]
*  It'll be in a limited number of service centers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=42.76s)]
*  If you say like very, like very sort of deep AI, heavy duty AI. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=45.64s)]
*  It's not it's not going to be in your laptop or your phone. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  It's going to be in a situation where there's like 100,000 really powerful computers working [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=53.64s)]
*  together in a service center. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=60.04s)]
*  So it's not so it's not like subtle and there are limited number of places where that can [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=61.8s)]
*  happen. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=67.16s)]
*  In fact, you could if you could just you can just look at the heat signature from space [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=68.16s)]
*  and it'll be very obvious. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm not suggesting we go and blow up to service centers right now, but there may be some it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=73.92s)]
*  may be wise to have some sort of contingency plan where the government's got an ability [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  to shut down power to these service centers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=85.2s)]
*  Like you don't have to blow it up. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  You can just cut the power. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=92.36s)]
*  And what would trip or cut connectivity as well. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=95.84s)]
*  That's another way. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  But what would trip that switch? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Do you think in your mind, what would be the threshold that you'd have to pass to warrant [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  the government cutting off your power or cutting off your signal? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=106.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, I guess if we lost control of some super AI, like for some reason, like [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=110.96s)]
*  the things that would normally work to do a passive shutdown, like the administrator [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=122.56s)]
*  if they somehow stop working where we can't slow down or, you know, I'm not sure I don't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=127.44s)]
*  have a precise answer, but if there's something that we're concerned about and are unable [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=139.72s)]
*  to stop it with with software commands, then we probably want to have some kind of hardware [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=147.96s)]
*  off switch. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=154.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=155.44s)]
*  I can't hurt. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=157.04s)]
*  Have you talked to since you know Larry Page and you obviously you know the open air guys [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=158.04s)]
*  because you started it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=161.88s)]
*  Definitely have one. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=162.88s)]
*  Have you talked to the people who run these two the biggest AI companies about this recently? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=163.88s)]
*  I haven't talked to Larry Page in a few years because he got very upset with me about open [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=170.88s)]
*  AI. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=177.0s)]
*  So when Open AI was created, it did shift things into it from unipolar world where Google [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=178.4s)]
*  and DeepMind controlled, like I said, three quarters of all AI talent to where there's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=187.68s)]
*  now sort of bipolar world or Open AI and Google DeepMind and now weirdly it seems Open AI [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=193.48s)]
*  is maybe ahead. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=202.72s)]
*  So I have had conversations with the Open AI team, Tim Altman. I haven't talked to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=206.48s)]
*  Larry Page because he doesn't want to talk to me anymore for a few years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=214.48s)]
*  Can I ask you this about since you've been around a lot of this, the thinking. So why [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=218.92s)]
*  would anyone not be a species, be human centered in his thinking about technology? What's the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=223.1s)]
*  thinking there? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=229.88s)]
*  I think what he's trying to say is that, if I were to guess, that all consciousness should [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=231.42s)]
*  be treated equally and whether that is digital or biological. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=239.94s)]
*  And you disagree? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=248.74s)]
*  I disagree, yes. Especially if the digital consciousness or whatever you want to call [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=250.34s)]
*  digital intelligence decides to curtail the biological intelligence. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=257.34s)]
*  So you're just building your own slave master and why would you do that? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  Doesn't sound great. Yeah, I mean, we should at least, no need to rush. What's the hurry? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=266.61999999999995s)]
*  Where's the fire? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=279.97999999999996s)]
*  Tell us about the hurry. I know you've been talking about this for years and on the periphery [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=283.54s)]
*  of our attention we've heard Elon Musk talking about AI. But for most people it's been like [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=288.1s)]
*  three months since they've had any interaction with this at all. So what's the timeline here? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=292.82s)]
*  At what point does it start to really change our society, do you think? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=298.82000000000005s)]
*  I think it's supposed to have probably an impact this year. GPD4, now it's like writing [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=304.82000000000005s)]
*  poetry. Pretty decent poetry, actually. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=312.18s)]
*  Pretty decent. Skill at rhyming is incredible. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=315.78s)]
*  Yes, and it's coherent. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=318.78s)]
*  Yes, it is. It's even got a narrative. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  Yes, that's right. That's hard to do. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=324.1s)]
*  Most humans can't do that. That's true. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=329.1s)]
*  So it's already past the point of what most humans can do. Most humans cannot write as [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=330.82s)]
*  well as a chat GPT. And no human can write that well that fast, as it's best of my knowledge. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=334.9s)]
*  So maybe Shakespeare. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=343.78s)]
*  How can you have a democracy with technology like that? I mean if democracy is government [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  by the people, each person's vote is equal to every other person's vote, I mean people [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=350.78s)]
*  are choosing their votes freely. Can you have a democracy with this? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's why I raise the concern of AI being a significant influence in elections. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=359.54s)]
*  Even if you say that AI doesn't have agency, well it's very likely that people will use [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=366.54s)]
*  the AI as a tool in elections. And then, you know, if the AI is smart enough, are they [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  using the tool or is the tool using them? So I think things are getting weird, and they're [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  getting weird fast. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=385.94s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens. Stories that are [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=387.42s)]
*  changing the world and changing your life. From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpSvyWLEu8M&t=392.54s)]
