# Former Mumford & Sons band member discusses being canceled by woke mob
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4)
*  Winston Marshall was a founding member of the folk band Mumford and Sons, world famous and for good reason. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=0.0s)]
*  He played banjo and lead guitar. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  But last year everything changed in an instant. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Marshall tweeted praise for a book by Andy Ngo on Intifi. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=10.0s)]
*  He wrote this quote, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=13.8s)]
*  Finally had the time to read your important book. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=14.4s)]
*  You're a brave man. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=16.6s)]
*  That was it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=18.0s)]
*  Nothing more than that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=19.0s)]
*  Well, in response to that, the mob absolutely descended like a swarm of bees on Winston Marshall. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=20.2s)]
*  He put out a statement saying he needed to assess his quote blind spots. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=25.6s)]
*  And then because of all the attention, since he didn't really want to be a political activist, he was a musician. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=29.4s)]
*  He left the band. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=33.8s)]
*  Now Winston Marshall has resurfaced. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=35.6s)]
*  He hosts a podcast for the spectator called Marshall Matters. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  He's learned a lot from the experience. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=41.2s)]
*  We want to check in with him tonight. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=42.6s)]
*  Winston Marshall joins us now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=43.8s)]
*  Winston Marshall, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  That was I remember thinking that was one of the most unreasonable attacks and anybody I've ever seen in my life. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  What happened to you? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=53.099999999999994s)]
*  What did you learn from it? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=54.9s)]
*  Taka, thank you for having me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=57.3s)]
*  Yeah, it was quite reasonable and reflecting now 18 months later, completely insane. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=59.2s)]
*  Really, I mean, I read a book through the pandemic. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=64.3s)]
*  I was tweeting about books I was reading from Mao's Little Red Book to Torstoy's War and Peace. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=67.8s)]
*  And for some reason to my not many followers, this book tweeting about Andy Ngo, the conservative journalist, this book blew up. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  And before the end of the day, the weekend, I think it was a segment on your show as well as on The View. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=82.69999999999999s)]
*  I had Antifa online activist changing my Wikipedia page to Winston Marshall is from Winston Marshall is a banjo player to Winston Marshall is a fascist. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  Not only is that ludicrous, but doubly ludicrous given that fascist actually slaughtered 30 members of my family in the Holocaust. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  So my family know about fascism. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=105.6s)]
*  But Antifa is a modern day problem in America. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=107.6s)]
*  And I didn't, I guess, anticipate how totemic the issue was at the time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=112.2s)]
*  And they drove you from a job that you were great at and certainly succeeding at. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=119.5s)]
*  If it happened to you again today, would you have handled it differently? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=125.2s)]
*  Well, initially, I apologized. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=130.9s)]
*  I issued an apology and I was made to take time away from the band, as you said, to examine my blind spots. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=133.2s)]
*  Now, I don't regret that because when you offend someone, it's natural. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=140.2s)]
*  Say you're at a dinner party, you fence on me. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=144.7s)]
*  So I'm so sorry. How have I offended you? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=146.4s)]
*  And then you look into it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=148.6s)]
*  And I spent the months that came after that looking into the topic. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, the book documents the 19 deaths in the first 14 days of the BLM riots. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=154.0s)]
*  It documents the many black businesses damaged and ruined by the looters and in the riots, as I said, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  and not to mention the federal courthouse in Portland being under siege for the entire month of July 2020 and much else. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=166.5s)]
*  And I looked into it and I thought I'd been right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  Actually, these are serious problems. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  And the music industry that pertorts to say it cares for black lives. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=178.7s)]
*  Well, it should care about the black lives because the majority of those 19 deaths were black lives. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  The majority of those businesses that were damaged were black businesses. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=188.0s)]
*  And so we ought to care about those. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=193.4s)]
*  And we need to think about that when we're looking at the whole greater picture. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=195.6s)]
*  So once I examined my blind spots and the author, Andy Ngo, the conservative journalist in that period, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=199.3s)]
*  was attacked once more by anarchists and Tifa mobs in Portland, Oregon, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=206.5s)]
*  I thought, you know what, my apology, it's part of the lie and I can't be part of the lie. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=212.9s)]
*  So I decided then the only thing for me to do was to quit the band, retract my apology. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=218.0s)]
*  But now I live in the truth and I feel liberated by that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  So I'm glad for that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=226.8s)]
*  And I don't have any regrets. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=228.0s)]
*  What an inspiring response, living in the truth and you feel liberated by it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you one last question, because I always wonder about this since I'm not in the music business. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=234.6s)]
*  How is your management team? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=238.3s)]
*  I assume you have one people around, manager, agent. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the people who give you career advice as a musician. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=242.9s)]
*  What was their view? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=247.3s)]
*  Well, the music industry is a very small industry. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=249.0s)]
*  And I would say that it's not entirely clear to me whether there is a chokehold by progressives on the industry [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  or whether there's a minority of progressives that have a chokehold on the majority. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=260.5s)]
*  That's not entirely clear. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  But there's certainly a lot of self-censorship going on. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=266.0s)]
*  And that's not just in the music industry. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=269.0s)]
*  It's across the creative industries in Hollywood and across your great country, America and in Britain. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=271.2s)]
*  There's a lot of self-censorship. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=277.2s)]
*  People who are too scared to say the truth. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=278.8s)]
*  And I think that's because, you know, there's professional and social repercussions if you do speak the truth. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=281.7s)]
*  And that's a serious issue. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=288.5s)]
*  I know you've been talking a lot about free speech on tonight's show. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=289.9s)]
*  So I thought it worth mentioning that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=293.0s)]
*  And when it comes to the business side, some of them are scared. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  Some of them are scared to say the truth and others believe. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=299.3s)]
*  Many are progressive as well who believe that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=303.3s)]
*  So there's a real split there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=305.5s)]
*  When I say believe, I mean they believe in those progressive ideas and those ideologies. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=308.0s)]
*  And they're part of the echo chamber. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=315.29999999999995s)]
*  It's a mixture. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=316.29999999999995s)]
*  You seem stronger and wiser for the experience, which is great to see. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=318.29999999999995s)]
*  I hope you play banjo again though, because you were great. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=321.29999999999995s)]
*  You are great. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  Winston Marshall, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=326.29999999999995s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiAiSJUNbL4&t=335.4s)]
