# Tucker rips Pete Buttigieg for 'spinning' supply chain crisis
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA)
*  At the beginning of the show we told you about the passing of 84 year old Colin Powell the former secretary of state [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=0.0s)]
*  whatever you thought of his role for example in the Iraq war or in the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=6.76s)]
*  Obama campaign anyone who ever spoke to Colin Powell knew conclusively he was a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=11.4s)]
*  Legitimately impressive very smart thoughtful patriotic person. That's just true. Ask someone who knew him. They'll confirm it [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=17.0s)]
*  The interesting thing is we noted was that Colin Powell always said it was probably a talking point that he was the beneficiary [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=24.16s)]
*  of affirmative action [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=29.46s)]
*  Maybe we can't prove it, but he certainly deserved to be where he got that's the view [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=30.98s)]
*  That's our view having known him to be perfectly blunt about it, which is not to say affirmative action isn't out there [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=35.940000000000005s)]
*  What else for example, but affirmative action could explain the ascent of the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=41.56s)]
*  Certain sort of affirmative action program for dwarfish frauds who once worked for McKinsey and Co [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=49.5s)]
*  Chelsea Clinton may have benefited from this as well in any case [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=55.3s)]
*  however [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=58.1s)]
*  He got there mayor Pete is somehow the secretary of transportation at this point and maybe it's not a coincidence that our transportation [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=58.46s)]
*  Infrastructure has collapsed there is a supply chain crisis and that means that shelves at your local store of things that you actually need to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=66.66s)]
*  Buy are empty [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=73.86s)]
*  So mayor Pete went on television the other day finally back to work to explain that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=75.58s)]
*  Actually the shortages the bare shelves they're assigned this country's thriving [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  retail sales are through the roof and if you think about those images of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  Ships, for example waiting at anchor on the West Coast [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  You know every one of those ships is full of record amounts of goods that Americans are buying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=93.86s)]
*  Because demand is up because income is up because the president has successfully guided this economy out of the teeth of a terrifying [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=99.94s)]
*  Recession now the issue is even though our ports are handling more than they ever have record amounts of goods coming through our [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=108.64s)]
*  supply chains can't keep up [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=115.72s)]
*  So it's not it's not the administration's fault [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=119.64s)]
*  They're doing such a good job that you have more money than you can spend and because you're so rich [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=122.0s)]
*  You want to spend it on so much stuff that we no longer have enough stuff for you to buy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=128.48s)]
*  So the shortages are really in effect your fault for being the undeserved [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=132.88s)]
*  Beneficiary of Joe Biden's economic genius got that but it's definitely not the administration's fault the gas and lumber and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=137.88s)]
*  Automobiles and everything you might actually want to buy has risen and the things that you need to buy like washing machines or [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Refrigerators or toilet paper simply aren't unavailable and none of that is Soviet. No, not at all. It's not the Brezhnev administration [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=154.56s)]
*  No [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=161.84s)]
*  It's utopia be happy about it. Stop your complaining [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=163.0s)]
*  Says mayor Pete the door fish fraud from McKinsey. I just thought we'd bring you up to date on his explanation for all of that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYcEDGuJdcA&t=168.2s)]
