# Washington Post harasses Canada trucker donors: Tucker
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y)
*  So Justin Trudeau ended democracy in Canada. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  He declared martial law this week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=4.44s)]
*  The irony is he seems to be losing control of Canada. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=6.28s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=9.8s)]
*  And he's becoming more desperate by the day. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=10.92s)]
*  Just today a conservative member of parliament challenged Trudeau in his declaration of martial [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=13.84s)]
*  law in the country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=17.68s)]
*  And in response, Trudeau accused her of standing with Nazis. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=18.68s)]
*  Conservative party members can stand with people who wave swastikas. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=24.12s)]
*  They can stand with people who wave the confederate flag. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=27.68s)]
*  We will choose to stand with Canadians. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=31.48s)]
*  So we don't know the member of parliament he was talking to. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=35.28s)]
*  We believe she's Jewish, though, probably not a Nazi sympathizer. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=38.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau's government has been carrying out their threat to seize the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=42.6s)]
*  bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets of anyone who criticizes Justin Trudeau. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=46.44s)]
*  Yeah, just a democracy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=51.16s)]
*  By the way, our State Department has said nothing about this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=52.16s)]
*  As democracy ends and tyranny reigns in our closest ally in the world, Joe Biden's State [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=54.72s)]
*  Department has said not one word. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=60.08s)]
*  Because Hungary's dangerous. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=62.2s)]
*  Man, they're dishonest. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=63.48s)]
*  Canada's government just banned 34 crypto wallets tied to the Freedom Convoy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=66.4s)]
*  Trudeau's allies in the media, of course, have been very busy helping him. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=73.28s)]
*  They've been harassing anyone who dared to donate to the truckers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=76.16s)]
*  Today, the Washington Post, owned by the world's richest man, began contacting people who donated [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=79.84s)]
*  as little as $40 to the convoy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=85.48s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=88.36s)]
*  That's not journalism. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=89.36s)]
*  It's an incitement to violence, among other things. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=92.0s)]
*  Then a reporter at the Ottawa Citizen called Ellison Ma exposing the identity of a cafe [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=94.8s)]
*  owner who dared to donate $250 to the convoy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=100.0s)]
*  Now that owner is receiving threats and she had to close her business. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=104.12s)]
*  This afternoon, Ilhan Omar, to her credit, tweeted this, quote, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  I failed to see why any journalist felt the need to report on a shop owner making such [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=111.28s)]
*  an insignificant donation than to get them harassed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  It's unconscionable and journalists need to do better. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  So Ilhan Omar is generally pretty loathsome, but when she says something that is true, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=122.56s)]
*  we're going to give her credit for it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=127.0s)]
*  Because unlike the Las Vegas Sun, we're not liars. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=129.0s)]
*  Victor Davis Hansen is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=132.32s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=134.96s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=136.16s)]
*  So the Washington Post cheering on and making possible the harassment of small dollar donors [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  to a truck driver convoy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=144.8s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  I think they're inadvertently doing their best to sort of make a tenement square scene [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  where they're in the tank and the truckers are the citizen that says come on. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=154.84s)]
*  And I don't think they intended to make this a fault line or to be iconic, but what's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=159.68s)]
*  happened, Tucker, is that the truckers have been iconic of this fault line throughout [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=164.04s)]
*  the middle of North America. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=168.92s)]
*  And on one side you have these people who are muscular and they brave the weather and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=171.08s)]
*  they're out there with COVID and they're bringing our food and our building materials and our [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=176.8s)]
*  fuel and they're opposed, on the other hand, by the Zoom class, who's profited enormously, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  pretty much in safety due to these truckers and people like them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=187.2s)]
*  Yet the truckers tend to have the pragmatic, because they're in the real world, they have [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  to deal with real things and they have greater common sense. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  So they look at Omicron and they say this natural virus is in its descendants. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  It's more infectious, but it's not as lethal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=204.72s)]
*  So people are getting herd immunity. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=207.28s)]
*  It's on the wane. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  It's time to let up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  And after all, we're in our trucks by ourselves and they give all these practical reasons [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  why you should listen to them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=216.32s)]
*  And the government has no answer, and yet they're the government of knowledge and they [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  can't answer them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=223.64s)]
*  And then the truckers are also saying, you know, this fault line is about more than us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  It's about the fundamental principle of Western jurisprudence, and that's the symmetrical [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=229.92s)]
*  application of the law. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=234.73999999999998s)]
*  And when there was protests all through North America, Canada too, BLM, Antifa, they had [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=236.76s)]
*  no masks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=243.6s)]
*  Our health care professionals, over a thousand, said that BLM didn't have to wear a mask out [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=245.0s)]
*  in the front. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=249.96s)]
*  And so everybody understands that the Trudeau government was for the BLM and Antifa, and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=251.48s)]
*  they were against people like this and they had no rational systematic fairness, and that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=257.88s)]
*  truckers are bringing that up. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  And ultimately, I don't think Trudeau is going to win this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=264.8s)]
*  Even the optics are bad. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=268.34s)]
*  He has a pajama boy persona, and these people are wonderful people, they're practical people, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=269.6s)]
*  and they're empathetic. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=275.76000000000005s)]
*  And I think eventually Trudeau is going to lose. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  And it's really a referendum on this ongoing cultural struggle that we're having in this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=280.12s)]
*  country against an entrenched bureaucratic elite and the corporations, Silicon Valley, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  the media versus the average person that has nothing other than common sense and popular [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=290.6s)]
*  support. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  He's a monster and a dictator, and I think all normal people are rooting against him [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=298.16s)]
*  fervently. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=301.72s)]
*  Professor, thank you so much for that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmzsXmV9B_Y&t=302.72s)]
