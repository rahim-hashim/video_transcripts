# Tucker: Here's who you should be afraid of
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight there is a verdict in that very depressing [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=2.6s)]
*  but also Byzantine and interesting murder trial [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=6.76s)]
*  in South Carolina tonight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=10.26s)]
*  We've got Judge Jeanine in a moment [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=11.44s)]
*  to take us through exactly what happened [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=13.26s)]
*  and what happens next. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=15.32s)]
*  But first, you always imagine in your mind's eye [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=17.1s)]
*  that it's evil men who destroy society, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=19.48s)]
*  wild-eyed spit fleck dictators pounding the podium [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=21.94s)]
*  to demand the annihilation of their enemies. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=25.72s)]
*  That's the Hollywood version of it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=28.38s)]
*  But in real life, people like that rarely get very far. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=30.66s)]
*  They're too obvious. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=33.24s)]
*  It's not the cartoon demons you've got to worry about. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=35.0s)]
*  It's weak men in positions of power. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=38.2s)]
*  They're the most dangerous. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=40.92s)]
*  Men with no principles but the desire for self-preservation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=42.64s)]
*  Hollow men who live in terror of being revealed [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=45.82s)]
*  for who they really are. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=48.72s)]
*  Men who will do anything to save themselves. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=49.84s)]
*  That's who you should be afraid of. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=52.92s)]
*  And you can see that in our current moment. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  The weakest are the most destructive. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=56.84s)]
*  How much of his childhood do you think Adam Kinzinger [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=59.84s)]
*  spent hanging from the wedgie nail? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=62.52s)]
*  How many swirlies did Eric Swalwell endure in high school? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=65.0s)]
*  How old was Adam Schiff before a girl other than his sister [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  kissed him voluntarily? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=73.12s)]
*  It makes you shudder to think about it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=75.32s)]
*  These are sad, insecure, broken men filled with envy [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=77.6s)]
*  and bitterness from their lonely childhoods. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=81.74000000000001s)]
*  They hate you because they hate themselves. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=84.4s)]
*  It's not their masculinity that's toxic. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=87.54s)]
*  It's their lack of it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  That's really the story of the Biden administration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=91.58000000000001s)]
*  The weakest president in history joined forces [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=93.76s)]
*  with the weakest attorney general in history [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=96.54s)]
*  to create a police state. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=98.7s)]
*  Shocking? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=100.98s)]
*  Well, once you understand the principle, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  it shouldn't really surprise you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=102.94s)]
*  And it's funny now to remember that the smart people [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=104.9s)]
*  in Washington once told us that Merrick Garland [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=107.18s)]
*  was a moderate. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  They thought that apparently because when Garland's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  promised Supreme Court seat didn't materialize, he cried. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=113.38s)]
*  Oh, he's crying, they thought. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  He's so sensitive and thoughtful. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=119.08s)]
*  But no, Merrick Garland was crying for himself [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=121.22s)]
*  because he is a self-pitying careerist [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=124.78s)]
*  with no perspectives on his own life [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  whose job is everything to him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  He is, in other words, literally the last person [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=131.44s)]
*  you would ever put in charge of the Department of Justice. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=133.32s)]
*  So naturally, Joe Biden did. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  And that turned out to be a pivotal decision. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=138.48s)]
*  Merrick Garland has presided over the most aggressive attack [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=141.0s)]
*  on civil liberties, and in particular, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=144.08s)]
*  an attack on the practice of traditional Christianity [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=145.7s)]
*  that any living American has seen. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=148.72s)]
*  Now, Garland would never say that in public, of course. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=151.32s)]
*  That would be too straightforward. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=153.16s)]
*  His approach is feline, not canine. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=155.16s)]
*  Every word is a weasel word. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=157.86s)]
*  But under sustained questioning, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=160.0s)]
*  the real Merrick Garland emerges, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=161.56s)]
*  and it is filthy and dishonest. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Here he was in the Senate yesterday [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=166.52s)]
*  facing off against Mike Lee of Utah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=167.94s)]
*  DOJ has announced charges against 34 individuals [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=171.16s)]
*  for blocking access to or vandalizing abortion clinics. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=174.12s)]
*  And there have been over 81 reported attacks [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=178.9s)]
*  on pregnancy centers, 130 attacks on Catholic churches [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=182.84s)]
*  since the leak of the Dobbs decision, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=187.44s)]
*  and only two individuals have been charged. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=189.56s)]
*  So how do you explain this disparity? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=192.04s)]
*  We apply the law equally. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=193.82s)]
*  I will say you are quite right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=196.28s)]
*  There are many more prosecutions [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=197.6s)]
*  with respect to the blocking of the abortion centers, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=199.34s)]
*  but that is generally because those actions are taken [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=206.18s)]
*  with photography at the time, during the daylight, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=210.54s)]
*  and seeing the person who did it is quite easy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=214.78s)]
*  Those who are attacking the pregnancy resources centers, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=219.5s)]
*  which is a horrid thing to do, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=222.54s)]
*  are doing this at night in the dark. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=225.06s)]
*  Okay, in case you didn't follow that, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=229.62s)]
*  we quote, apply the law equally. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=231.58s)]
*  We just can't for some reason manage to investigate crimes [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=234.34s)]
*  that occur after dark. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=237.5s)]
*  It's the sundown rule, well-known in legal circles. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=238.66s)]
*  It's hard to believe that Merrick Garland actually said that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=242.0s)]
*  in a Senate hearing until you remember that, of course, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=244.24s)]
*  he will say anything, and he does. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=246.04s)]
*  We're not persecuting Christians, they'll tell you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=247.9s)]
*  Then he'll send the FBI after Mark Hauk. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=250.56s)]
*  Hauk is a pro-life lay preacher [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=252.62s)]
*  who was praying outside an abortion clinic [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=254.78s)]
*  when a pro-abortion extremist harassed his 12-year-old son. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=256.9s)]
*  So as any father would, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=260.41999999999996s)]
*  Hauk shoved the man out of his son's face. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=261.62s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=263.78s)]
*  It was not a crime, we know that, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=264.62s)]
*  because no local prosecutor pursued it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=266.85999999999996s)]
*  And it is certainly without question, not a federal felony, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=269.64s)]
*  to push a lunatic out of your 12-year-old son's face. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=274.12s)]
*  But under Merrick Garland, it is now a felony. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=278.38s)]
*  Almost a year after that happened, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=280.88s)]
*  Garland sent armed men to arrest Mark Hauk [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  in front of his family. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=285.66s)]
*  On September 23rd, about 6.45 in the morning, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=287.54s)]
*  that's when those 20 so-called agents, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  full SWAT gear, heavily armored vest, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=295.54s)]
*  ballistic shields, helmets, battering ram, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  banged on my door. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  Yesterday, Josh Hawley asked Garland to explain that behavior, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=305.68s)]
*  the utterly indefensible totalitarian behavior. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=309.74s)]
*  And Merrick Garland, of course, in his soft-spoken way, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=313.58000000000004s)]
*  was delighted to defend it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=316.22s)]
*  Let's take a look at the hardened criminals [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  that your Justice Department sent these armed agents [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=320.98s)]
*  to go terrorize on that morning. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=324.18s)]
*  Here they are, here they are at mass. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=325.54s)]
*  Here's the seven children with Mr. Hauk and his wife. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  He has offered to turn himself in, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=333.82000000000005s)]
*  and this is who you go to terrorize. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  You are the attorney general, give me your answer. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=340.86s)]
*  Do you think that it was objectively reasonable [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=342.98s)]
*  and they followed your guidelines [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  in sending 20 to 30 armed agents to terrorize these people? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=348.02000000000004s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=352.62s)]
*  The facts I have, which are those presented by the FBI, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=353.5s)]
*  are not consistent with your description. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=356.5s)]
*  So you think it was reasonable? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=358.82s)]
*  I'm saying the facts are not as you describe. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=360.82s)]
*  You use an unbelievable show of force [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=363.66s)]
*  with guns that I just note liberals usually decry. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=366.38s)]
*  We're supposed to hate long guns and assault-style weapons. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=369.58000000000004s)]
*  You're happy to deploy them [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=372.02s)]
*  against Catholics and innocent children. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  He doesn't care, he's got no soul, obviously. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=376.82s)]
*  And if anything, Josh Hawley's description is too narrow. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=379.62s)]
*  It's not just Catholics that Merrick Garland [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=381.74s)]
*  has targeted with force, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=383.29999999999995s)]
*  it's anybody who expresses a belief [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=384.96s)]
*  in biblical Christianity in public. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=386.53999999999996s)]
*  But it is true that Catholics do seem to be getting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=388.9s)]
*  a disproportionate share of federal law enforcement [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=390.74s)]
*  attention under Joe Biden. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=393.85999999999996s)]
*  The FBI, as you may know, just drafted a memo claiming [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=395.56s)]
*  that radical traditional Catholics [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  were somehow a national security threat, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=400.18s)]
*  presumably because they tend to pray [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=402.66s)]
*  outside of abortion clinics. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=404.66s)]
*  In March of 2021, Paul Vaughn and 10 others [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=406.42s)]
*  were peacefully praying at an abortion clinic in Tennessee. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=409.46s)]
*  They didn't damage any property, they hurt no one. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=412.7s)]
*  More than a year after they dared to do that, to pray, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=415.98s)]
*  Merrick Garland sent the FBI to terrorize Vaughn [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=418.54s)]
*  and his 11 children at their home. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=421.62s)]
*  But if you're not going to let me, then I'll just- [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=424.82s)]
*  No, I wanna know why you were banging on my door [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=426.5s)]
*  with a gun. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=429.38s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  Hey. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=431.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=431.88s)]
*  Okay, let's get back to it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  You're not gonna tell me anything? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=437.26s)]
*  No, I do not. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=439.26s)]
*  I tried, you know. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=440.1s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=442.14s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=442.98s)]
*  You did not try. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=443.82s)]
*  You have to wonder, when you see a tape like that, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=449.7s)]
*  where are so-called Christian leaders? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=451.62s)]
*  Where's Russell Moore and all the other [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=454.98s)]
*  breast-beating Christians as that happens, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=457.06s)]
*  as the US government cracks down on Christianity on prayer? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=459.62s)]
*  Silent. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=464.1s)]
*  Paul Vaughn and his co-conspirators now face more [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=465.24s)]
*  than a decade in prison. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=468.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, just in case you wanna know what the scale [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=470.06s)]
*  is for punishment, the Department of Justice, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=472.54s)]
*  under Joe Biden, let half the rioters go [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=474.9s)]
*  who tried to torch a courthouse in Oregon. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=477.46s)]
*  No charges whatsoever of 99 cases [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=479.96s)]
*  that the Portland U.S. Attorney brought [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=482.74s)]
*  over that courthouse siege for crimes [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=484.32s)]
*  like assaulting federal officers and civil disorder. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=485.94s)]
*  More than 47 were dropped by DOJ. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=489.34s)]
*  The most serious penalties for most of the defendants [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=492.38s)]
*  who pleaded guilty turned out to be community service. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=494.74s)]
*  So the DOJ and America absolves Joe Biden voters [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=498.54s)]
*  of actual terrorism while doing everything they can [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=502.86s)]
*  to terrify, humiliate, and destroy people [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=506.44s)]
*  who pray in public. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=509.5s)]
*  They're targeting specifically anyone who is religious, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=511.4s)]
*  humiliating them in front of their children. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=514.66s)]
*  Now, why are they doing this? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=517.42s)]
*  Well, because on some level, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  all governments hate religious people [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  because it's competition. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=524.8399999999999s)]
*  And revolutionary governments, totalitarian governments, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=526.54s)]
*  go after religious people first. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=529.76s)]
*  It happened in the French Revolution, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=532.14s)]
*  it happened in the Bolshevik Revolution, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=533.42s)]
*  and it's happening now. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=535.06s)]
*  That's why parents who dare to complain [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  about their children being sexually indoctrinated [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=538.3s)]
*  and openly sexualized are attacked. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=540.6999999999999s)]
*  In some cases, by the DOJ. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=543.72s)]
*  Again, you can see why. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=546.76s)]
*  Young people raised to believe that God is in charge [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=548.24s)]
*  are much harder for the government to control [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=551.84s)]
*  as they grow up. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=554.24s)]
*  They won't worship the government. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=555.62s)]
*  But by contrast, if a child is raised to be a narcissist, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=557.76s)]
*  someone who thinks, I can change my gender, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=561.2s)]
*  he will grow up confused, weak, and reliant on the people [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=563.5600000000001s)]
*  in charge of the state. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  It's a very simple principle. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=568.58s)]
*  It's why the Maoist government went after Tibetan monks. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=570.62s)]
*  Anyone who sincerely believes in God is a threat. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=573.74s)]
*  And that is the measure of a free country in the end. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=576.8s)]
*  Are you allowed to believe that there's an authority [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=580.42s)]
*  higher than the people in charge of your government? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=583.12s)]
*  That has always been the hallmark of America, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=586.62s)]
*  religious liberty. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=588.42s)]
*  It's in the First Amendment. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=590.78s)]
*  But in Canada, of course, that's all disappeared. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=592.84s)]
*  Canada has now become an atheist totalitarian state [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=594.84s)]
*  with amazing speed. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=597.4s)]
*  And in Canada, it's now a crime to object [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=598.88s)]
*  to sexualized drag shows for children. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=600.84s)]
*  Not allowed to say a word. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=602.74s)]
*  Late last month, a pastor in Calgary [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=604.26s)]
*  was violently thrown out of an all ages, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=606.96s)]
*  in other words, for children, drag queen story hour [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=609.5s)]
*  for daring to object to the sexualization of children. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=612.1800000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=615.14s)]
*  We are now calling the police. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=619.2s)]
*  Stop, stop, stop. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=621.0s)]
*  We have the police coming. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=624.14s)]
*  So it is your choice to leave or deal with the police. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=625.98s)]
*  So that's the video. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=631.34s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=633.02s)]
*  Who committed the violence in that video? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=634.72s)]
*  The guy on the ground was the pastor. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=636.64s)]
*  Before we answer the question, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=638.78s)]
*  some context will remind you that in Canada, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=639.9s)]
*  showing any disloyalty at all to the Trudeau government [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=642.38s)]
*  could get your bank account frozen and your truck seized. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=646.26s)]
*  So maybe you're not surprised to learn [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=649.4s)]
*  that that man on the ground, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=650.86s)]
*  whose name is Pastor Derek Reamer, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=652.14s)]
*  who showed profound disrespect for Justin Trudeau's [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=654.14s)]
*  ongoing efforts to sexualize children [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=656.6s)]
*  and mutilate the genitals of children, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=658.4200000000001s)]
*  woke up yesterday to the police banging on his door [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=660.52s)]
*  and telling him he was gonna be arrested. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=663.58s)]
*  Why are you showing up at my home? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=666.02s)]
*  Cause this is where you live, right? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=668.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you guys could call me, we could. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=670.34s)]
*  Sorry, what was that? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=673.4200000000001s)]
*  You could have called me. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=674.26s)]
*  I've been trying to. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=675.1s)]
*  When? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  This morning. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=677.76s)]
*  We need to talk about what happened [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=679.14s)]
*  on the weekend this evening, right? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=679.98s)]
*  Why do we need to talk about it? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=682.3000000000001s)]
*  Cause you're gonna be arrested for it and charged. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=683.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=686.94s)]
*  So we can deal with it this morning, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=687.7800000000001s)]
*  or I can just put warrants out for you. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=689.3000000000001s)]
*  What's the charge with what? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=692.3000000000001s)]
*  Miss Jeff and closing the service. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=693.58s)]
*  Where are all the professional Christians? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=696.9200000000001s)]
*  You have to wonder that again. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=698.46s)]
*  Where's David French and Beth Moore and Tim Keller [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=701.2s)]
*  and all these people who are defending Christianity [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=704.82s)]
*  as actual Christians are being arrested for being Christians? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=706.9000000000001s)]
*  Hmm, not a word. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=710.0200000000001s)]
*  Well, today, Pastor Derek Grimur confirmed [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGwiC7SlDAI&t=712.9s)]
