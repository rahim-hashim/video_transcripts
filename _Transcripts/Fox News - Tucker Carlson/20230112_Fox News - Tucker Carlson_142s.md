# Tucker: If you're having sex with a Chinese spy, sorry, you can't be on an intel committee
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I)
*  So, Devin Nunes ultimately left the House Intel Committee, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=0.0s)]
*  in fact, he left the House of Representatives, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=3.4s)]
*  Eric Swoellow of California, went on the Intel Committee, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=4.76s)]
*  and now he's getting booted off the Intel Committee, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=7.84s)]
*  and he's very mad about it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  He went on television yesterday to claim [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=11.28s)]
*  he's being ejected from this committee [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=13.08s)]
*  out of, quote, pure vengeance. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=15.64s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  Chris, the only person who supports this is my wife, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=18.72s)]
*  who is like, great, you're gonna be home [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=20.78s)]
*  to change more diapers. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=22.42s)]
*  I love it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=23.72s)]
*  Um, but the truth is, Chris, it's purely vengeance, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  and I just want to walk your viewers through this, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=27.88s)]
*  because this happened nearly 10 years ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=30.04s)]
*  The FBI told me that someone who had been helping [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=32.98s)]
*  our campaign in a district with 35% Asian Americans [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=35.12s)]
*  may be working with the Chinese government. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=40.4s)]
*  I did what I hope every one of my colleagues would do, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=42.4s)]
*  which was to help the FBI get this person [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=44.8s)]
*  out of the country. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=48.3s)]
*  It's only now that a Trump Intel official [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=49.14s)]
*  had leaked my cooperation to suggest [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=52.34s)]
*  that there was some wrongdoing on my part. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=54.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's just political vengeance, says Eric Swallow, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=57.98s)]
*  but that's not true, and actually we did some reporting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  on this, because what actually happened is important. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=62.98s)]
*  So the last director of national intelligence [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=66.88s)]
*  went to Capitol Hill and briefed the Intel committees [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=69.48s)]
*  about foreign espionage threats, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=72.06s)]
*  and at the time, he recommended to the so-called gang [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=74.16s)]
*  of eight that Eric Swallow, the man you just saw, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=76.5s)]
*  be removed from the House Intel Committee, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=78.94s)]
*  the most sensitive committee in the House of Representatives. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=83.56s)]
*  Because he'd been compromised by China, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=84.48s)]
*  and that's not an overstatement. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=87.16s)]
*  A Chinese spy helped get Eric Swallow elected [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=88.64s)]
*  to the Congress. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=91.88s)]
*  A Chinese spy raised money for Eric Swallow's campaign. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=92.7s)]
*  A Chinese spy campaigned for Eric Swallow. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=96.28s)]
*  A Chinese spy placed staffers in Eric Swallow's office, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=98.98s)]
*  but the main problem, and the main problem [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  that the Intel community had with Eric Swallow [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=105.52s)]
*  is that he had sex with a Chinese spy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=108.82s)]
*  Now, we've made fun of him over the years for this, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=112.16s)]
*  but it's real, and Swallow has never denied it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=114.72s)]
*  because he can't deny it, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=117.38000000000001s)]
*  and everyone who's looked into it knows that it's true. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=119.16s)]
*  So we're not here to cast aspersions [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=122.16s)]
*  on Eric Swallow's personal life, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=123.62s)]
*  but if you're having sex with a Chinese spy, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=125.3s)]
*  sorry, you can't be on the House Intel Committee. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=127.38s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNsKUxmiV2I&t=129.78s)]
