# Tucker: People should not put up with this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk)
*  Pedro Gonzalez is the associate editor of Chronicles magazine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=2.64s)]
*  Pedro, what do you make of this? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=3.92s)]
*  Well, Tucker, thanks for having me. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=6.48s)]
*  Well, the system that failed and resulted in the FDA grounding, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=8.08s)]
*  the FAA grounding all those flights is actually 30 years old. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  And it's not due for an update for another six years. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=16.56s)]
*  And I was actually trapped at an airport yesterday for several hours. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=19.52s)]
*  And ultimately, it's probably going to take me longer to get back to my family. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=22.32s)]
*  But when I was thinking about this clearly, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  I was filled with a warm and fuzzy feeling because our transportation czar [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  is married to a man and believes roads are racist. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=33.28s)]
*  So all of this is actually progress, except it's not. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=36.72s)]
*  Change is not the same thing as progress, obviously. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  We're witnessing the third worldification of US infrastructure. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  And Mayor Pete is actually the ideal guy to oversee this decline. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=47.68s)]
*  He has all of the right credentials under the rubric of liberalism. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  I think that's important. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=55.84s)]
*  People say he's not qualified. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=56.64s)]
*  He actually is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=58.08s)]
*  He has all of these important but ultimately meaningless credentials [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=59.36s)]
*  stapled to his goofy forehead. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=63.12s)]
*  And he can claim status with a sacred victim group. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=64.88s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg does not ask questions when the government wants to ban your gas stove [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=68.72s)]
*  to fight climate change and when it can't put airplanes safely in the sky. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  He also has all the right bromides at hand. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=77.84s)]
*  In other words, he's ready to say a whole lot of nothing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  It's just weird that people put up this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=86.0s)]
*  You've got all your freaky theories about sex changes or whatever, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=88.24s)]
*  but ultimately you kind of have to make sure the planes don't crash, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  that they can take off in the first place, the power grid works. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=94.32s)]
*  People should not put up with a degradation in the basics. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  Why are they? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=101.28s)]
*  I think because we've gotten used to this, it seems like inertia. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  And it's not just happening on the level of government. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=106.88s)]
*  Remember, think back to the summer of St. George Floyd. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=109.6s)]
*  City Group, one of the sleaziest organizations, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=113.36s)]
*  one of the sleaziest financial institutions in the world, rehabilitated itself. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=115.76s)]
*  It rebranded itself not by changing structurally. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  Like you said, you would expect an organization like that to change structurally. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=123.76s)]
*  Instead, City just came out against racism. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=127.44s)]
*  And then suddenly people stopped demanding change and they settled for, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=130.08s)]
*  well, City opposes racism and that's good enough for me. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=133.6s)]
*  That is so true that I'm chuckling at it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=138.88s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=140.56s)]
*  Pedro Gonzalez, great to see you tonight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8CyPlODdk&t=144.08s)]
