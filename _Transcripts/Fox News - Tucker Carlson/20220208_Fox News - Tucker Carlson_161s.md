# Tucker: This is Biden-style Democracy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls)
*  Well, Joe Biden, you may recall, spent a lot of his time as vice president meddling in the internal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=0.0s)]
*  affairs of Ukraine. And you may wonder why Ukraine, as opposed to say Denmark or Senegal or any of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=5.84s)]
*  world's other 195 countries. Simple, because the Ukrainians were paying Joe Biden's family a million [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=10.96s)]
*  dollars a year in exchange for the work that he did. And as president, you may have noticed, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=16.64s)]
*  Biden has continued to represent Ukrainian interests, most recently in their dispute with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=21.36s)]
*  Biden talks constantly about all the scary things he'll do if bad old Vladimir Putin dares to offend [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=26.16s)]
*  the territorial sovereignty of Biden's close friends, the Ukrainians. But one thing Joe Biden [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=32.0s)]
*  will not do, he has assured us repeatedly, is send American troops to Ukraine. Polls show Americans [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  do not want that at all. And Biden claims he's heard the message. Watch. This would be the largest, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=42.8s)]
*  if he were to move in with all those forces, it'd be the largest invasion since World War II. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  It would change the world. Thank you guys. Thank you guys. Thank you guys. Thank you guys. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=53.68s)]
*  You guys, come on. Let's go. Thank you. There is not going to be any American forces moving into [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  Ukraine. There are not going to be any American forces moving into Ukraine. That's what Joe Biden [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=66.56s)]
*  told us. And it's reassuring to hear that. But wait, it's not true. It's yet another lie from [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=73.2s)]
*  the mannequin, in case you're still bothering to keep track of them all. Fox News has just learned [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=78.08000000000001s)]
*  that there are already more than 300 American troops in, yes, Ukraine. Now, Joe Biden's calling [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=82.24s)]
*  the military advisors, just like we did back in Vietnam. Troops, advisors, it's really a distinction [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  without a difference. Just last week, we were told there are only 150 American troops in Ukraine. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=92.16s)]
*  As far as we know, the force has more than doubled in recent days. And that's assuming the new number [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=96.88s)]
*  is even real. And by the way, why would we assume that number is real? These people lie about [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=100.88s)]
*  everything. The truth is we have no idea how many American troops are in Ukraine right now, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=106.0s)]
*  only that the total is a lot more than they said it was because, again, they lie all the time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=112.0s)]
*  So here's the question. There are American troops in Ukraine. What's going to happen to these troops [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=116.08s)]
*  if and when the Russians invade? Now, the Pentagon says there are no plans to pull these troops out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=121.2s)]
*  And so that means that very soon American soldiers could be fighting Russian soldiers, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=126.48s)]
*  which sounds to our civilian ears very much like the definition of war with Russia. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=130.96s)]
*  Are you ready for war with Russia? Has anyone asked for your consent or even your opinion [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=136.72s)]
*  on war with Russia? No. That's democracy, Biden-style. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwYRXPm5ls&t=142.16s)]
