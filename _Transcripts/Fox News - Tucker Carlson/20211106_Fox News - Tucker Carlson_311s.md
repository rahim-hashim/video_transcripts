# Horace Cooper: Evil to link Winsome Sears to White supremacy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk)
*  So Winsome Sears is the new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=0.0s)]
*  lieutenant governor elect of the state of Virginia. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=2.0s)]
*  She's a black Republican who doesn't support [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=4.44s)]
*  the left's racial grievance politics. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=7.36s)]
*  She's thinking for herself. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=9.64s)]
*  And that of course is intolerable on the left. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=11.48s)]
*  On MSNBC, a guy called Michael Eric Dyson, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=14.0s)]
*  who's a professor at Georgetown University, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=18.0s)]
*  accused Winsome Sears of, get this, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  being a black white supremacist. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=23.36s)]
*  Honestly, this is one of the most disturbing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=26.38s)]
*  and to put it bluntly, racist attacks we've ever seen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=28.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=32.6s)]
*  They want white supremacy by ventriloquist effect. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=34.08s)]
*  There is a black mouth moving, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=37.04s)]
*  but a white idea through the running on the runway [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=39.04s)]
*  of the tongue of a figure who justifies and legitimates [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=42.88s)]
*  the white supremacist practices. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=47.6s)]
*  We know that we can internalize in our own minds, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  in our own subconscious, in our own bodies, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=52.96s)]
*  the very principles that are undoing us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=55.44s)]
*  So to have a black face speaking in behalf [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=58.92s)]
*  of a white supremacist legacy is nothing new. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=61.4s)]
*  Horace Cooper is the co-chair of Project 21 [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=65.4s)]
*  and he joins us now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=68.04s)]
*  Horace, great to see you tonight. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=69.16s)]
*  I don't think it's surprising to hear such vile [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=71.48s)]
*  and absurd rhetoric coming from the two individuals [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=75.16s)]
*  we just saw on that screen, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=77.44s)]
*  but it is surprising, Horace, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  that MSNBC and their parent company Comcast [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=80.68s)]
*  seem okay with it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=84.04s)]
*  Well, it is very disappointing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=85.06s)]
*  You know, there was a time when cable companies, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=86.7s)]
*  TV companies, radio networks all had a code that said, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=89.9s)]
*  as we are gonna voluntarily comply with this idea, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  we won't promote racism, we won't promote bigotry. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  They apparently at MSNBC have walked [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=103.5s)]
*  completely away from that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=106.5s)]
*  And if you just took the wrong path, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  the video off and just played the audio, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  you would assume some racist or segregationist [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=118.58s)]
*  from the 1940s was talking in the way that they attribute [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=124.12s)]
*  to race certain ideas and certain thoughts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  That's really dangerous. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=135.38s)]
*  It's actually quite evil. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  Oh, no doubt about it, Horace. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=139.94s)]
*  Help me out. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=141.42s)]
*  Let me see if I translate it correctly. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=142.26s)]
*  If you are black, you must think one and only one way. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=144.45999999999998s)]
*  That's what I heard, and it's not the first time [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  I've heard it from the likes of Michael Eric Dyson. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=151.94s)]
*  If you are black, you can't be an astronaut. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=156.7s)]
*  If you are black, you can't be an elected official. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=160.34s)]
*  If you are black, you need to stay in your place. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  That's what the segregationists have said. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=168.56s)]
*  Now, I'm gonna remind the audience that in the 19th century, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=171.42s)]
*  one political party decided that it was going to make race [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=176.94s)]
*  the primary issue, disparaging one group [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  and promoting another. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  When we had a civil war and we thought that was settled, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=186.94s)]
*  that one political party came back again [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=191.27999999999997s)]
*  in the 20th century, and they set up Jim Crow [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=194.42s)]
*  with the idea that race explains everything [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=198.66s)]
*  and your abilities and your talents don't. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=202.82s)]
*  We had Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=206.1s)]
*  Millions of people like myself grew up [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=210.3s)]
*  in this post Martin Luther King period, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=213.82s)]
*  but now the woke racists are back in the 21st century, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=217.26s)]
*  and once again, they posit your race determines [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  your role, your function, and your options. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=228.02s)]
*  That's bigotry 101, regardless of what century it comes from. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=232.02s)]
*  Yeah, Horace, everything is upside down. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=236.5s)]
*  It seems that those who call themselves anti-racist [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=239.46s)]
*  are the most racist. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=243.02s)]
*  Those who today advocate for racial empathy [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=245.08s)]
*  are at the simultaneously advocating [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  for racial segregation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=250.62s)]
*  How did, and we don't have much time left together, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=252.46s)]
*  Horace, here, but how did we end up in this place [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=254.78s)]
*  where in order to be protected from being called a racist, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=256.74s)]
*  the best way to behave is to actually be a racist? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=259.86s)]
*  Well, let's remember that in the 19th [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=264.92s)]
*  and the 20th centuries, those advocates of bigotry said [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=267.1s)]
*  they weren't doing it to disparage anyone. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=271.04s)]
*  They were doing it because it was great for everyone. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=273.8s)]
*  The same idea still obtains today. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=276.8s)]
*  Don't worry about what they say. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=280.02s)]
*  Look at what they're doing, and what they're doing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=282.12s)]
*  is separating people on the basis of race. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=284.82s)]
*  Horace Cooper, really insightful stuff. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=288.42s)]
*  The individual, how radical of an idea. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=290.58s)]
*  Celebrate, honor, look at the individual. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=292.58s)]
*  Thanks for being with us tonight, Horace. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLHhawDwNk&t=295.32s)]
