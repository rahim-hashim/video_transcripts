# Tucker Carlson: The Biden admin is incentivizing bad behavior
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  For centuries, politicians in this country assumed that in order to win an election, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=3.22s)]
*  you had to convince voters to vote for you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=7.34s)]
*  You had to make their case. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=9.44s)]
*  That was called democracy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=10.6s)]
*  But the defining strategic insight of the modern Democratic Party is that you don't [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=13.16s)]
*  really need to convince anyone of anything. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=16.44s)]
*  What matters is demographics. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  You need to import enough people from elsewhere, people who are financially dependent on you, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  in order to live. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=26.0s)]
*  That's the story of the state of California. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=27.96s)]
*  That's why California changed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=29.68s)]
*  It's why Texas is changing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=30.96s)]
*  But it's also happening at the local level all over the country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=33.12s)]
*  Democrats have realized that they win the vote in virtually every major city. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=36.68s)]
*  But the suburbs remain contested. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=41.4s)]
*  And that matters because suburban voters like school boards and state legislators and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=43.56s)]
*  of course members of Congress. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=48.68s)]
*  So if you want total control over the entire country, you need demographic change everywhere, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  including in the suburbs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=55.64s)]
*  This is a very obvious insight and Democrats have been on the case for quite a while. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=57.8s)]
*  Back in 2009, the Obama administration took the county of Westchester in New York, a solidly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=62.0s)]
*  democratic place, to court. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=67.12s)]
*  Why'd they do that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=70.0s)]
*  Well, the administration withheld tens of millions of dollars in federal funding unless [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=71.0s)]
*  Westchester pledged to build 10,000 low-income, high-density apartments in their suburbs. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  The Obama administration later implemented a rule requiring suburbs to take, quote, affirmative [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=81.16s)]
*  to diversify their neighborhoods or else they would lose federal money. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=86.1s)]
*  When he took office, Joe Biden threw his support behind something called the Home Act. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=90.46s)]
*  Among other things, the Home Act would allow the federal government to withhold funds from [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=94.74s)]
*  local governments if they didn't find ways to add high-rise apartments or high-density [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=98.41999999999999s)]
*  zoning to suburbs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  Specifically the act would have prevented local governments from enacting, quote, ordinances [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=106.3s)]
*  that ban apartment buildings from certain residential areas or set a minimum lot size [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=110.72s)]
*  for a single-family home. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=115.42s)]
*  So you can't be safe in a leafy suburb anymore. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=118.3s)]
*  It has to be urbanized. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  The Home Act has stalled in Congress. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=124.42s)]
*  It has never become law. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=125.9s)]
*  But the Biden administration didn't give up just because democracy didn't produce the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=127.62s)]
*  results they wanted. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  They still plan to change the suburbs forever by getting rid of them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=132.56s)]
*  Joe Biden's HUD secretary, Marsha Fudge, a former member of Congress, explained last [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=136.1s)]
*  year that the administration was concerned that African Americans could not afford homes [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=140.06s)]
*  not because they're poor, but because home appraisers are racist. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=144.14s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=148.14s)]
*  What the president has said is that we have to look at everything through a lens of equity. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=149.14s)]
*  And so what we have realized is that people selling homes, just as the persons you were [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=153.1s)]
*  talking about, and even people buying homes, if their appraisal is not correct, what we [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  find, especially as black people in communities of color and underserved communities, is we [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=162.11999999999998s)]
*  lose great wealth just through the appraisal process. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  Notice here the seizing of the moral high ground. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  Big picture. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=176.78s)]
*  If the Biden administration cared about African Americans, they probably wouldn't withdraw [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=177.78s)]
*  the police from America's city. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=181.06s)]
*  So they, of course, they don't care. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=183.18s)]
*  But in point of fact, former congresswoman Marsha Fudge, in the clips you just saw, presented [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=185.06s)]
*  no evidence whatsoever that there are white supremacist home appraisers in this country [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=189.22s)]
*  or that they are running amok. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=194.38s)]
*  If they exist, who are they? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=196.04s)]
*  Well, she couldn't tell us. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=197.9s)]
*  But instead she offered this anecdote. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  I live two doors from an all-white community. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=202.5s)]
*  I live in an all-black community. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=204.5s)]
*  My house is larger than the house two doors for me. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=206.54s)]
*  My lot is larger than the house two doors for me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=209.34s)]
*  But my house is valued at $25,000 less than the house two doors for me. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=211.8s)]
*  And so once we can start to address and just own up to the fact that we are continuing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=216.34s)]
*  to discriminate in red line in our housing efforts, then I think that we can make sure [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=222.44s)]
*  that we can start to deal with the racial wealth gap. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=227.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=229.98s)]
*  So as the left is often telling you, an anecdote is not a study. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  Noticing something around you doesn't make it universally true. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=237.34s)]
*  You've proved nothing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=241.82s)]
*  You've merely told us a little story. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=242.82s)]
*  Marsha Fudge's lived experience tells her that there is racism in home appraisals. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=245.7s)]
*  But there's still no data on that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=250.89999999999998s)]
*  There's no evidence whatsoever. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=252.14s)]
*  It is at this point completely made up. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=254.7s)]
*  But Kamala Harris is convinced completely. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=258.1s)]
*  Here she was last year. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=260.02s)]
*  The home appraisal workforce is one of the least diverse in our nation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=262.5s)]
*  Less than 5% of home appraisers in America are people of color. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=268.9s)]
*  This lack of diversity can introduce both conscious and unconscious biases that make [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=275.46s)]
*  home appraisals less accurate and less fair. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  Our administration will now require those who conduct appraisals for federal programs [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=287.98s)]
*  must take part in anti-bias, fair housing, and fair lending training. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=294.14s)]
*  There are solutions. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=300.86s)]
*  There are solutions. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=305.94s)]
*  We're just going to brainwash the home appraisers. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=306.94s)]
*  We're going to put them in bias training. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=312.3s)]
*  If you wanted more black home appraisers, why wouldn't you start a program to train [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=315.29999999999995s)]
*  them? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=319.14s)]
*  No. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=320.14s)]
*  The only job training program this administration has gotten behind in two and a half years [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=321.14s)]
*  is getting black people to sell more weed in the cities. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=324.7s)]
*  Literally. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=327.5s)]
*  We're legalizing weed and we're going to make sure the weed dispensaries have African American [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=328.5s)]
*  owners. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=333.09999999999997s)]
*  They're not training any black people to be home appraisers. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=334.09999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, the premise of this is itself unproven. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=335.94s)]
*  That home appraisers are racist? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=339.73999999999995s)]
*  Why do we think that? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=341.17999999999995s)]
*  Again, there's zero evidence of that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=342.17999999999995s)]
*  There's a slur upon home appraisers, by the way. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=344.14s)]
*  Why do they deserve this abuse? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=346.5s)]
*  Well, they don't. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=347.86s)]
*  They're not hurting anyone. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  They're accountant types. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=351.74s)]
*  Why is the administration calling them racist? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=352.74s)]
*  But they are and they have been for more than a year. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=356.18s)]
*  So once again, they're using fake allegations of racism as a pretext for a political plan. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=359.2s)]
*  And in this case, the plan is to flood the suburbs with voters they believe will support [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=365.86s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=369.94s)]
*  It's super simple. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=370.94s)]
*  They don't deserve the moral high ground. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=372.02s)]
*  It's because they're throwing race around or claiming they speak on behalf of black [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  people. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris is claiming to speak on behalf of black people. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=379.5s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=380.5s)]
*  That doesn't mean that they're right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=381.5s)]
*  But no one's stopping them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=383.34s)]
*  So without any vote in Congress, the Biden administration has just introduced a rule, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=384.38s)]
*  not a law, a rule that will punish Americans who've tried to do the right thing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=388.06s)]
*  Punish people with high credit scores. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=393.62s)]
*  The people with high credit scores will pay higher fees on their mortgage payments to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=395.9s)]
*  subsidize people who haven't maintained good credit. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=400.74s)]
*  So these rules take effect on May 1st, whether you like it or not. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=406.1s)]
*  And they mean that anyone with good credit, that's defined as the score of 680 or above, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=409.94s)]
*  is going to have to pay roughly $40 a month extra on their mortgage fees than those with [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=414.46000000000004s)]
*  lower scores on home loans of around 400 grand. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=419.06s)]
*  So here's an example. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=422.44s)]
*  If you have a FICO score of 620, you get a 1.75% discount on your mortgage fees. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=423.54s)]
*  If you have a 740 score, in other words, you pay your bills on time, you've done the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=430.4s)]
*  right thing, you're a good citizen, you have to pay 1% more. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=434.23999999999995s)]
*  So you don't get a discount for doing the right thing and paying your bills. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=439.64s)]
*  You get punished. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=443.53999999999996s)]
*  We are incentivizing bad behavior. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=445.52s)]
*  We're hurting the good people. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=448.28s)]
*  Since the day you were born, you have been told, pay your debts. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=450.35999999999996s)]
*  It's not your money. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=453.28s)]
*  You borrowed it from somebody else. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=454.28s)]
*  You have to pay it back. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=455.28s)]
*  If you don't, it's stealing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=456.38s)]
*  Now we're saying, if you don't steal, we're going to hurt you. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=458.76s)]
*  And in real life, that means that over the course of a 30-year mortgage for a $400,000 [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  home, that's a swing of more than $14,000. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=466.52s)]
*  They're claiming racism to justify this. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=470.32s)]
*  Black Americans are the only racial group in this country with average credit scores [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=474.12s)]
*  of under 680. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  Now why is that? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=480.52s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=482.44s)]
*  Whites, Hispanics, Asians have higher credit scores. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=483.44s)]
*  Therefore, as you'd expect, the mortgage denial rate for African-American borrowers is higher [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=486.04s)]
*  than the overall population. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  It's double in this country's bigots markets. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=490.76000000000005s)]
*  That's the reason the suburbs have different demographics from the cities. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=493.88s)]
*  That's called economics. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=497.12s)]
*  Now if you wanted to change that, you would encourage people to have good spending habits [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=498.12s)]
*  and pay back their debt. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  But they don't care about that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=505.58000000000004s)]
*  Making people happier and getting them out of debt? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=507.24s)]
*  No. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=509.48s)]
*  They want to change the suburbs, make them denser, so there'd be more reliably democratic [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=510.48s)]
*  voting. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=515.28s)]
*  That's the bottom line. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=516.28s)]
*  It's always about election results. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=517.28s)]
*  It's always about power. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=519.16s)]
*  It's not about improving anybody's life. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=520.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Democratic Party's donors in private equity, of course, are happy it'll [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=522.48s)]
*  be even harder for Americans with good credit to buy homes. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=527.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=531.48s)]
*  Because that will mean more renters. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=532.48s)]
*  Renters of homes they own. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=534.6s)]
*  Home ownership is increasingly out of reach. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=537.48s)]
*  In our portfolio, the majority cannot afford to buy a home or don't have the credit to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=541.0s)]
*  buy the homes. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=547.64s)]
*  I think if you asked a lot of millennials, and that tends to be our primary resident, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=548.64s)]
*  they would probably tell you they don't necessarily desire to own a home or to own a car. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=553.84s)]
*  They've grown up in the sharing economy, and for what's important to them is lifestyle. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=558.96s)]
*  So if they can move into this, what we call a turnkey or hotel-ready home, and have a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=564.4s)]
*  low-maintenance lifestyle, that's very compelling for them. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=569.06s)]
*  People don't want to even, they don't want to own anything. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=572.6199999999999s)]
*  They want to be penniless and impoverished, live at the whims of oligarchs. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=577.02s)]
*  That's really what they want. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=581.78s)]
*  Do you own anything, Mr. Oligarch Guy? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=583.06s)]
*  She never asked. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNdNcVol2Y&t=586.7399999999999s)]
