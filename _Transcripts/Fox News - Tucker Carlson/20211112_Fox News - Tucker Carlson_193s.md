# Inflation crisis is starting to feel intentional: Durr
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs)
*  Edward Dyr is the center of a really interesting story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a truck driver for a furniture company. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=2.58s)]
*  Most people had not heard of him [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  outside of his immediate friends and family. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=6.32s)]
*  Then just the other day, he came out of nowhere [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=7.9s)]
*  to be one of the most powerful politicians [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=10.24s)]
*  in the state of New Jersey, a machine politics state. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=11.96s)]
*  That'd be the president of the New Jersey State Senate, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  a man called Steve Sweeney. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=16.7s)]
*  Edward Dyr spent $153 on his primary campaign. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=18.66s)]
*  Now he's gonna represent [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=22.7s)]
*  New Jersey's third legislative district. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=23.54s)]
*  Edward Dyr joins us tonight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=25.38s)]
*  Mr. Dyr, Senator, we're honored to have you on tonight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=26.7s)]
*  So I gotta ask you, how much were you motivated [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=30.98s)]
*  to run for office by concerns like inflation and gas prices? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=35.74s)]
*  Was that meaningful to you? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=39.86s)]
*  Oh, well, everything's meaningful to me, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=42.78s)]
*  but it just became a, as I keep telling people, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=44.7s)]
*  a perfect storm. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=48.82s)]
*  You not only had the high cost of living in the state, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=49.82s)]
*  the worst tax rate, the worst business tax rate, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=53.32s)]
*  you had people being told they couldn't live, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=58.42s)]
*  they couldn't go to stores, they couldn't go to church. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=61.5s)]
*  You had the nursing home deaths. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=63.96s)]
*  It just became a combination of everything, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=65.5s)]
*  and I got fed up with it, and I said, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=68.54s)]
*  I'm not leaving the state, I'm gonna fix the state. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=70.26s)]
*  Well, that seems like a triumph of- [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=73.6s)]
*  And that's what I chose to do. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=74.44s)]
*  I mean, that's the triumph of democracy, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=75.6s)]
*  It's a citizen who decides [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=78.1s)]
*  he wants a hand in running his government, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=79.42s)]
*  but you weren't congratulated by a lot of media outlets. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=81.1s)]
*  They immediately attacked you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=84.06s)]
*  for saying naughty things on Twitter or whatever. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=85.3s)]
*  Were you surprised that you weren't the subject [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  of a feature film after this triumph? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=90.1s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=93.62s)]
*  This is all a surprise. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=98.14s)]
*  I knew it was a major thing to beat the Senate president. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  He had been in there a long time, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=102.46s)]
*  but everybody else has kind of made it a big deal. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=104.34s)]
*  You know, I had a lot of great people around me. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=107.86s)]
*  I had my county chair, Jackie Vigiliani, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=110.42s)]
*  and my political director, Steve Cush, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=112.62s)]
*  leading the path, and I have to get it out there, Tucker. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  There was a lot of people who won, not just myself. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  You had my two running mates, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=121.1s)]
*  Beth Ann McCarthy-Patrick and Beth Sawyer, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=122.38s)]
*  and then you had Nick DeSilvio and Chris Conowell, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  who won county commissioner, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=128.54s)]
*  and then you had John Sammons, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  who won the first African-American sheriff [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=130.74s)]
*  in our county. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=132.54s)]
*  These people all worked hard. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=133.98s)]
*  We all knocked doors. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=135.42s)]
*  Have you talked to Sweeney since you dethroned him? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=138.14s)]
*  I mean, how baffled is he? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=141.06s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=142.9s)]
*  We had a phone conversation yesterday [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=143.74s)]
*  after he had given his press conference to the media, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=146.54s)]
*  and he congratulated me and just wished me luck [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=150.3s)]
*  to do well for South Jersey. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=154.3s)]
*  So he was a gentleman about it? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=157.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=160.5s)]
*  He was a gentleman. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=161.34s)]
*  Good for him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=162.9s)]
*  And we, you know, and like I told him, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=163.74s)]
*  I said, you know, if he ever needed anything, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEg49WSEBs&t=166.5s)]
