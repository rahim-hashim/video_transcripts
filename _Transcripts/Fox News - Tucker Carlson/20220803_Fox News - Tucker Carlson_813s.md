# Tucker Carlson: They don't care about you at all
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=0.0s)]
*  If you're an incumbent member of Congress, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=3.12s)]
*  pretty much the last thing you ever want to do [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=5.28s)]
*  is debate a primary opponent in public. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=7.4s)]
*  As a sitting member, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=10.44s)]
*  you already have every possible advantage. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=11.28s)]
*  Unless you drop dead during a speech [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=13.48s)]
*  or get drunk and take your clothes off [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=15.4s)]
*  on a commercial airplane, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=16.96s)]
*  you are very likely to be reelected to Congress. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=18.28s)]
*  So a televised debate cannot help you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  It is all risk and no upside. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=23.04s)]
*  But occasionally there is no avoiding it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=25.72s)]
*  Democrats held a primary debate in New York City last night. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=27.48s)]
*  They had no choice. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=29.96s)]
*  Both the candidates in this race are incumbents. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=31.2s)]
*  Thanks to a court decision [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  that redrew congressional boundaries, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=35.6s)]
*  the two most powerful members of the New York delegation [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=37.24s)]
*  are now running against each other for the same seat. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=40.0s)]
*  That's a lot of fun. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  For 30 years, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=44.88s)]
*  Carol Maloney has represented the Upper East Side [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=45.8s)]
*  of Manhattan. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=47.68s)]
*  Over the same period, 30 years, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=48.64s)]
*  Jerry Nadler has represented the Upper West Side of Manhattan. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Jerry Nadler is 75 years old. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=53.84s)]
*  Carol Maloney is 76 years old. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=55.52s)]
*  Rather than do the obvious thing and retire, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=57.8s)]
*  the two are now competing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=60.4s)]
*  for the newly drawn 12th congressional district. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  That will combine the Upper East Side [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=64.36s)]
*  and the Upper West Sides of Manhattan. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  It turns out to be the richest district [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=68.36s)]
*  in American politics. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  Four of the Democratic Party's five top fundraising zip codes [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  are within this district's boundaries. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=74.6s)]
*  So there's a lot at stake [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  and we forced ourselves to watch the debate. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=78.2s)]
*  We are richly rewarded for doing that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=80.52s)]
*  We're gonna start tonight with a headline from the debate, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=83.4s)]
*  which you've already likely seen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=85.12s)]
*  Neither one of these people is cheerleading for Joe Biden. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=86.52s)]
*  He's Carolyn Maloney. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=90.08s)]
*  Should President Biden run again in 2024? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=92.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=95.32s)]
*  Mr. Nadler. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=96.16s)]
*  Too early to say it doesn't serve the purpose [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=97.44s)]
*  of the Democratic Party to deal with that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=99.6s)]
*  until after the midterms. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=102.96s)]
*  Ms. Maloney. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  I don't believe he's running for reelection. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=105.0s)]
*  I don't believe he's running for reelection. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=108.36s)]
*  That's what Carolyn Maloney said. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=110.16s)]
*  Well, like everything she says, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=111.6s)]
*  it's not exactly a profound observation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  Of course, Joe Biden isn't running for reelection. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=114.6s)]
*  He can barely find the men's room. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=116.8s)]
*  The second the midterms are done, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  he will find a way to tell the rest of us that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  So that was not very interesting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=121.96s)]
*  It was predictable. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=123.64s)]
*  What was very interesting [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  and what tells you a lot about the Democratic Party [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=126.0s)]
*  is how these two candidates [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=129.32s)]
*  talked about their personal accomplishments [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=130.76s)]
*  and their goals for the country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=133.92s)]
*  Now we should tell you, having watched it, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=136.44s)]
*  that figuring out exactly what Maloney and Nadler [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=138.0s)]
*  were trying to say was not easy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=140.0s)]
*  These are not spry, articulate people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=142.12s)]
*  They're not magicians with the English language. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=145.08s)]
*  Jerry Nadler is so enervated, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  he had to sit for the entire debate [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=149.04s)]
*  because he is too weak to stand. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=150.84s)]
*  But at one point, Nadler gathered the strength [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=153.12s)]
*  to boast about his greatest accomplishment in the Congress. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=155.32s)]
*  That would be impeaching George W. Bush twice. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=159.44s)]
*  An insurrectionist Republican Party [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=163.52s)]
*  for the first time in our history, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=166.36s)]
*  trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=167.96s)]
*  Now, therefore I am leading the fight to stop this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=171.16s)]
*  and I have passed the two impeachments. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=178.12s)]
*  And in leading this, I've impeached Bush twice. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=182.24s)]
*  Bush twice. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=188.0s)]
*  The secret to Jerry Nadler has never been his appearance, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=189.88s)]
*  often remarked upon, it's been his intellect, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=192.88s)]
*  which is small. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=194.92s)]
*  Obviously, Nadler meant to say Donald Trump, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=197.88s)]
*  not that he can remember what decade it is, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=199.8s)]
*  but what he meant to say is not really a consolation [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  for Democrats watching at home. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=204.36s)]
*  The problem here is that Jerry Nadler and Carol Maloney, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=206.0s)]
*  these are two of the most powerful Democrats [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  in the United States Congress, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=212.12s)]
*  running in the most influential district [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=213.52s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=216.4s)]
*  Neither of these candidates have anything to say. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  So Jerry Nadler is asked, what are you proud of? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=221.52s)]
*  And he's talking about multiple impeachments. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=223.68s)]
*  Whatever you think of impeachments, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  did they improve a single life in this country? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=228.32s)]
*  No. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  So she was asked the same question, Carol Maloney, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=233.68s)]
*  what are you proud of? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=235.88s)]
*  What are your priorities? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  And so she responded, here are Carol Maloney's priorities [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=239.16s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=242.28s)]
*  Our work is not over yet. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=244.28s)]
*  We need to protect women. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=246.72s)]
*  We need to pass gun safety laws. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=248.72s)]
*  We need to combat climate change. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=251.12s)]
*  So those are her top priorities. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=254.76s)]
*  This one was powerful sitting members of Congress. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=256.48s)]
*  First party, protecting women. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=259.92s)]
*  In other words, more abortions, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=262.20000000000005s)]
*  protecting women from having children [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=263.76s)]
*  so they can continue to work [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  at some depressing midtown bank. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=266.76s)]
*  Don't raise your family, go to work. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=269.04s)]
*  Well, Carol Maloney does not mean by protecting women, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=272.68s)]
*  of course, is punishing criminals. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  They're free to beat women on the subway in New York [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  with no consequences, and they routinely do. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  But that's number one, protecting women, more abortions. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=281.6s)]
*  Okay, number two, gun safety laws. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=283.6s)]
*  Now, none of these gun safety laws, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=286.92s)]
*  meaning gun confiscation laws will be enforced [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=288.48s)]
*  in places where the Democrats get a huge percentage [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=291.04s)]
*  of the vote, like Chicago or Baltimore, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=293.56s)]
*  New York or Gary, Indiana. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=295.12s)]
*  They get a pass, but disarm the other side. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=296.6s)]
*  And then number three, combating climate change. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=299.36s)]
*  Because you don't need air conditioning in the summertime. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=303.0s)]
*  You don't need a car. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=306.6s)]
*  Look at Sri Lanka, they've done a great job. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=308.48s)]
*  What's interesting is what Carol Maloney didn't mention [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=311.6s)]
*  as a top priority, and that would be the economy, inflation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=314.04s)]
*  And it's interesting because every poll taken shows [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=317.44000000000005s)]
*  that inflation is the number one issue [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=320.44000000000005s)]
*  that actual Americans care about. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  So why wouldn't Carol Maloney, who's a politician, after all, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  can probably read a poll, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=328.56s)]
*  why would she not include inflation? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=330.24s)]
*  Well, it's possible she's not aware it's happening. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  And we know this from the president [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=336.88000000000005s)]
*  of the San Francisco Fed, that would be Mary Daly. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  She explained her views on inflation inadvertently. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=342.6s)]
*  Apparently she was unaware she was being recorded. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=345.24s)]
*  And because she didn't know anyone was listening, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=347.72s)]
*  Daly explained that inflation doesn't matter to her [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=349.6s)]
*  because she's rich. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=352.24s)]
*  And we're quoting. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=353.88s)]
*  I don't find myself in a space, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=355.16s)]
*  that's how they talk in San Francisco, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=357.16s)]
*  in a space where I have to make trade-offs [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=358.24s)]
*  because I have enough. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=360.48s)]
*  And many Americans have enough. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=362.0s)]
*  Ooh, you've got enough. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=364.8s)]
*  You've got enough. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=366.8s)]
*  Stop your whining. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=367.8s)]
*  Time to fix the climate. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=369.76s)]
*  We're in charge of the weather now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  So these are the issues [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=374.44s)]
*  that the leaders of the Democratic Party [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=377.4s)]
*  and the party's donors, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=379.2s)]
*  many of them in San Francisco and New York, care about. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=380.64s)]
*  They don't care about inflation because they're rich [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=383.32s)]
*  and it doesn't affect them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=385.32s)]
*  In other words, they don't care about you at all. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=386.52s)]
*  And by the way, this isn't just true [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=389.56s)]
*  of longstanding establishment figures [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=390.88s)]
*  in the Democratic Party like Jerry Nadler [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=392.52s)]
*  and Carol Maloney. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=393.88s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=395.24s)]
*  It's endemic. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=396.08s)]
*  In the fabric of the party itself, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=397.0s)]
*  even people who want to join the club [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=399.2s)]
*  repeat the same lines. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=402.32s)]
*  At the debate last night, Maloney and Nadler at 76 and 75 [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  were joined by a 38 year old lawyer called Siraj Patel. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=407.48s)]
*  Now Patel runs a multimillion dollar [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  hotel management company. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=412.76s)]
*  He was the guy on stage who's supposed to be [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  a breath of fresh air, the face of a new generation. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  So what did he talk about? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=420.72s)]
*  Issues that people care about? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=421.56s)]
*  No. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=423.12s)]
*  He referred back 15 years to describe his so-called ideas [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=424.48s)]
*  because it turns out he's an Obama Democrat. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=428.36s)]
*  My name is Siraj Patel and I am a lawyer, a professor, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=432.44s)]
*  and an Obama Democrat from whom I learned [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=435.84s)]
*  that Democrats lead best when we lead with new ideas, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=438.16s)]
*  energy, and a new generation of leadership. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=440.72s)]
*  Yeah, that guy's got new ideas and energy, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=443.68s)]
*  just like Barack Obama. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=446.56s)]
*  That's why he's supporting Joe Biden [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=448.6s)]
*  running for reelection again. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=451.2s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=453.44s)]
*  It's not just him, it's not just Maloney, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=454.96s)]
*  it's not just poor Jerry Nadler. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=457.23999999999995s)]
*  It's the entire Democratic Party. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  The Democratic Party has run out of gas. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=461.2s)]
*  Democratic Party at this point is a cartel [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=463.88s)]
*  that exists only to perpetuate itself [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=465.79999999999995s)]
*  and the elderly mediocrities who run and benefit from it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=468.08s)]
*  All of them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=471.76s)]
*  Carmella Harris is only 57 years old. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  She's a child by the standards of her party. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=474.79999999999995s)]
*  But she still talks like a dementia patient, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=477.79999999999995s)]
*  slowly and incomprehensibly. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=479.56s)]
*  Here's Carmella struggling to explain [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=482.4s)]
*  what mail-in ballots are. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=484.84s)]
*  Now you'd think she would understand mail-in ballots [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=486.32s)]
*  given that mail-in ballots are why she has a job, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=488.24s)]
*  but she doesn't. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=491.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=491.92s)]
*  They said when they voted, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=492.76s)]
*  I think sometimes with voting, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=493.64s)]
*  it's you just putting in your order. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=494.84s)]
*  This is what you want. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=496.52s)]
*  So when people stood in those lines for hours, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=498.68s)]
*  when they sat at their kitchen table for hours, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=501.68s)]
*  figuring out how they were gonna fill out their ballot [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=505.04s)]
*  to vote by mail, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=508.32s)]
*  when they drove by those drop boxes [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=510.32s)]
*  with their kids in the backseat, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=512.04s)]
*  patiently waiting to drop off that ballot, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=514.52s)]
*  they were putting in an order. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=517.76s)]
*  We don't mean to beat up on Carmella Harris, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=520.76s)]
*  who's obviously our favorite [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=522.4s)]
*  for the Democratic nomination next cycle, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=523.92s)]
*  but she is a perfect distillation [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=526.56s)]
*  of everybody in power in the Democratic Party. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=529.44s)]
*  Every word that emerges from Carmella Harris's mouth [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=532.36s)]
*  is a recycled talking point [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=536.32s)]
*  that's been run through a banality machine [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=538.16s)]
*  to remove the slightest hint of anything interesting [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=540.48s)]
*  or challenging or relevant or meaningful. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=542.88s)]
*  So no wonder Democrats are unpopular. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=546.24s)]
*  They have nothing to offer. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=548.76s)]
*  They haven't updated their files. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=551.28s)]
*  They believe it's 2005. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=553.36s)]
*  You see this in foreign policy particularly. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=555.68s)]
*  They are living in their heads in a world [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=558.04s)]
*  in which the US wields the world's most powerful military [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=560.52s)]
*  backed by the world's strongest economy [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=563.64s)]
*  and can do whatever it wants [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=565.4s)]
*  just by telling other people to obey. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=566.84s)]
*  So like Joe Biden, you just tell Russia, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=570.4s)]
*  don't invade Ukraine. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  And of course it won't, we're America. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=573.32s)]
*  You just let China know that we back Taiwan [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=575.32s)]
*  and the entire 75 year old dispute [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=578.08s)]
*  over that island will be settled forever. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=580.76s)]
*  They really believe that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=582.88s)]
*  They have no idea of this country's relative place [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=584.2800000000001s)]
*  in the world order because they don't know anything [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=588.72s)]
*  about reality as it stands right now. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  So here's Nancy Pelosi who imagines that she's so powerful [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=596.16s)]
*  that she can somehow bring about an indefinite peace [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=599.9599999999999s)]
*  in the Taiwan Strait just by saying so, watch. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  Today, our delegation, of which I'm very proud, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=605.68s)]
*  came to Taiwan to make unequivocally clear [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=609.4s)]
*  we will not abandon our commitment to Taiwan [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=612.72s)]
*  and we are proud of our enduring friendship. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=615.92s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=620.04s)]
*  It's the barking of dogs. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=622.52s)]
*  It's less relevant than dogs barking [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=624.0400000000001s)]
*  and trust us, the Chinese know that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  But from Nancy Pelosi's perspective, I said it, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=629.64s)]
*  therefore it's going to happen. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=632.48s)]
*  Problem solved. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=633.96s)]
*  That's the world they believe we still live in. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=635.12s)]
*  They imagine the United States is still so rich [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=638.36s)]
*  and powerful that we can afford [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=640.88s)]
*  any sort of pointless frivolity. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=643.08s)]
*  We can tamper with the formula and suffer no ill effects. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=645.32s)]
*  We can hire trans admirals and intersexual CIA officers [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=647.8000000000001s)]
*  and everything's going to be fine. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=651.36s)]
*  That's how powerful we are. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=652.48s)]
*  We can force Delta Airlines and United [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=654.52s)]
*  to apply affirmative action standards to airline pilots [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=657.24s)]
*  and somehow our planes will never crash [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=660.24s)]
*  because nothing bad ever happens in the world. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=662.52s)]
*  These people have completely lost touch with reality. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  How out of touch are they? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=669.48s)]
*  Well, the Democratic party's main radical right now [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=670.92s)]
*  is Sandy Cortez of Westchester. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=673.28s)]
*  How radical is Sandy Cortez? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=675.24s)]
*  Well, she spends her days defending the intel agencies [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=676.72s)]
*  and Neocon foreign policy and the big banks. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=680.2s)]
*  So if your revolutionaries are reading scripts [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=685.1600000000001s)]
*  written by the World Economic Forum, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=687.96s)]
*  maybe they're not actually very revolutionary. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=689.72s)]
*  Maybe they're defending the status quo [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=691.88s)]
*  and that's exactly what they're doing. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=694.0s)]
*  And they're doing it because they have no other plan. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=696.96s)]
*  The sad truth is the people who run the Democratic party [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=702.0400000000001s)]
*  have just given up. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=704.32s)]
*  They've given up on the country [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=705.6s)]
*  and given up on the people who live here. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=706.6400000000001s)]
*  They've got no solutions for you. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=709.08s)]
*  They're not even pretending that they do. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=710.84s)]
*  Climate, trans, they don't imagine a future. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=713.76s)]
*  That's what they're telling you, smoke more weed, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=718.72s)]
*  take more pills, might as well cut off your junk [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=720.96s)]
*  and pretend to be a girl, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  sterilize your kids, abort your babies. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=724.5200000000001s)]
*  There's no future worth having. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  That's not a caricature, they're saying that out loud. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=729.72s)]
*  They're done. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=733.96s)]
*  Now the Republican party, by contrast, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=736.12s)]
*  is suddenly showing signs of life, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=737.84s)]
*  of thinking and responding to reality. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=739.64s)]
*  They're faint signs, trust me, the people who run it [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=741.64s)]
*  have no interest in changing the Republican party. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=744.2s)]
*  They've gotten rich from it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=747.08s)]
*  They're pretty happy with their sign of cures. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=748.0s)]
*  Liz Cheney and Mitch McConnell are enraged by the changes. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=750.24s)]
*  They're content with 2003. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=753.84s)]
*  They'd like to invade Iraq again, actually. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=755.2s)]
*  Mitch McConnell's got pretty rich from China, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=757.88s)]
*  doesn't want that to change. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  But they're not actually in control of the party. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=761.64s)]
*  The Republican party is changing [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=763.96s)]
*  and we know that for certain [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=765.4000000000001s)]
*  because last night's election results [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=766.36s)]
*  in a couple of primaries show not just new faces, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=768.4s)]
*  but new ideas. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  Blake Masters won the Republican primary for Senate [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=774.52s)]
*  in the state of Arizona. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=776.84s)]
*  Candidates like Peter Meyer, for example, of Michigan, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=778.48s)]
*  the guy who voted to allow men to play in women's sports [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=782.28s)]
*  because he's sensitive, lost. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=784.96s)]
*  In the Republican primary for Arizona's gubernatorial race, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=788.52s)]
*  Carrie Lake has just taken the lead. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=791.6s)]
*  She's not like your parents' Republican party. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=794.04s)]
*  And in the state of Michigan, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=796.76s)]
*  Tudor Dixon is now the Republican nominee. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=798.28s)]
*  She will take on Gretchen Whitmer in the fall. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ezj72XUIos&t=800.56s)]
