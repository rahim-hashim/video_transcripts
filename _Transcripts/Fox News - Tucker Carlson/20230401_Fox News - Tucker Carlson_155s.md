# Democrats are determined to criminalize Trump: Glenn Greenwald
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY)
*  Glenn Greenwald has long reported on the political abuses of the legal system. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the host of System Update on Rumble and our friend, he joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=4.8s)]
*  Glenn, you would think somebody would say, look, I don't like Trump, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=8.8s)]
*  but this is doing grave damage to institutions we're going to need two years from now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=12.6s)]
*  and for the next hundred years, but not one person that we can find has said that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=16.8s)]
*  I heard you in your prior segment saying where people like Karl Rove and George Bush [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=21.6s)]
*  and the people who lecture us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=25.2s)]
*  I think people like Victoria Nuland demonstrate the theater behind this whole Republican versus Democratic war. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=26.4s)]
*  This is the key to the whole thing, which is that they are determined not to criminalize conservatism or the Republican Party. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  They're fine with people like Jeb Bush or John McCain or Mitt Romney or Nikki Haley or Lindsey Graham or whoever. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=38.8s)]
*  They're determined to criminalize Donald Trump and his movement because the only time Victoria Nuland wasn't in government, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  she was worked for Clinton, then she worked for George Dick Cheney, then she worked for Obama. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=52.0s)]
*  Now she worked for Biden was when Donald Trump was elected president. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=55.9s)]
*  That's the only way you get these people out of government. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=59.5s)]
*  And that's why they're single-mindedly determined to criminalize not their Republican Party, but Donald Trump and his movement. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=61.9s)]
*  And that's what we saw yesterday with his indictment and today with this person who's now going to prison [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=67.9s)]
*  because of anti Hillary Clinton memes he posted on Twitter. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=72.6s)]
*  The problem is in organizing the system that way, they cut out the majority of the population [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=76.2s)]
*  are the majority of American voters of either party in favor, for example, of going to war with nuclear armed Russia and China. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=82.0s)]
*  I don't think there's any evidence the majority is in favor of that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=89.30000000000001s)]
*  Do you know or for example, keeping troops in Syria, which I would bet you barely anybody even knows that the United States is doing, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=92.2s)]
*  let alone wants to. And yet Matt Gaetz had a resolution to withdraw all troops in Syria saying we shouldn't be spending money on that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't be spending money here at home. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=106.7s)]
*  When the Republicans and Democrats joined together, the establishment links to say, no, we want to keep let Joe Biden keep troops in Syria. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=108.1s)]
*  It's the establishment wings of both parties that are the real enemy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  And they're the ones who rule no matter what you go and do at the voting booth. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=119.6s)]
*  Donald Trump was the only one who could disrupt it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=123.8s)]
*  And that's why they want to criminalize that movement. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. I mean, if you were just to write out the crimes of Donald Trump being obnoxious, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=129.1s)]
*  OK, versus the crimes of Toria Nuland destroying the West, you know, one list would be longer than the other. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=134.3s)]
*  But who's getting indicted? Glenn Greenwald. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=141.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Thanks, Dr. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9WbL5JkacY&t=142.4s)]
