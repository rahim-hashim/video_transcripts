# Former drug addict to Biden: Stop coddling criminals
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4)
*  Oh, so it's Caracas now, and we're not doing anything about it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=0.0s)]
*  Ask anyone who owns a business in downtown Los Angeles, in Beverly Hills even, it's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  completely out of control. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=9.48s)]
*  And the reason it is, is because police aren't punishing people the way they did. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=11.16s)]
*  In New York City, a man was just busted with 20,000 fentanyl pills in Chelsea, which was [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=15.52s)]
*  a nice neighborhood in New York, and he was released immediately. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=19.88s)]
*  So this doesn't work. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=25.0s)]
*  The question is, what does work? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=26.64s)]
*  One of the smartest people we've talked to in our hour-long Fox Nation show in the last [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=28.8s)]
*  year is a woman called Ginny Burton. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=31.92s)]
*  She's 50, she's a mother of three, and for most of her life, she was badly addicted to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=33.76s)]
*  drugs. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  And while addicted, she committed a slew of crimes, car theft, she even shot somebody. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=38.52s)]
*  She racked up 17 separate felony convictions and served three separate terms in prison, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=42.7s)]
*  and then she did something that too many do, she got total control of her life, she even [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=48.32s)]
*  graduated college, and in the process of that, gained a lot of wisdom. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=52.56s)]
*  And so it's with great pleasure that we welcome Ginny Burton to the show tonight. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=56.3s)]
*  Ginny, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=59.5s)]
*  So you've seen this from both sides, as a drug-addicted person committing crimes and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=61.98s)]
*  a clear-thinking person with hard-earned wisdom assessing what's happening to the country. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=66.24s)]
*  What should we be doing differently, do you think? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=70.3s)]
*  Well, we need to be incarcerating with intention, Tucker, which, you know, this administration [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=72.34s)]
*  is definitely not addressing any of the necessary components of what's happening in our society [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=78.64s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=86.52s)]
*  They're using a harm reduction approach, not just to drugs, but also to crime, and that's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=87.52s)]
*  extremely problematic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=92.88s)]
*  So you say incarceration with intention. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=95.68s)]
*  So the idea is if you put someone behind bars, it's cruel, you're really the criminal for [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=97.44s)]
*  wanting to do that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=102.48s)]
*  And you're saying, having been in prison three separate times, it can be good not just for [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=104.04s)]
*  society but for the person incarcerated. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=108.2s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=110.12s)]
*  That's exactly what I'm saying. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=111.12s)]
*  When we incarcerate with intention, which neither side has done up to this point, but [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=113.72s)]
*  we're seeing a rapid decline in our communities and with humanity in general, you know, and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=117.12s)]
*  the United States is sort of leading the way with that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=123.68s)]
*  We're taking this harm reduction approach everywhere. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  And what's happening is we're seeing an increase in overdose deaths and a decrease in incarceration. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=129.08s)]
*  But when we incarcerate with intention, what we would essentially be doing is implementing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=135.28s)]
*  services during incarceration that actually help people to take control of their own lives. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=142.1s)]
*  And what this would also do is it would create more of a safety net in the community of people [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=147.28s)]
*  that have been victimized, people that have been impacted by those who are committing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=153.32s)]
*  crimes, which I want to say that probably I would say upwards of 90 plus percent of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=158.12s)]
*  people that are in active addiction commit crimes and those that are committing crimes [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=162.0s)]
*  are also using drugs and alcohol. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=168.1s)]
*  So these underlying causes would be addressed very intentionally so that we're making sure [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=170.94s)]
*  that we're attacking the problems when we have people separated from the destructive [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=175.86s)]
*  path, if that makes sense. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  So addiction means crime, not just because you're breaking the law by using drugs, but [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=182.18s)]
*  you are driven to crime. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=185.68s)]
*  So my question really simple to you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=186.68s)]
*  Do you think you ever would have gotten better as a drug addict? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  And you were definitely a drug addict. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=193.24s)]
*  Would you have gotten better if you hadn't been incarcerated? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=194.68s)]
*  No. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=196.84s)]
*  And I'll be honest with you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=197.84s)]
*  I'm extremely grateful in this moment that that incarceration was an option for me because [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  if I was using today with the policies that are in place right now, I wouldn't be where [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=204.8s)]
*  I am. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  And we're denying people an opportunity to actually thrive and to get their lives back. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=211.64s)]
*  What I can tell you about my own experience is that I didn't have the necessary skills [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  to navigate society. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  And if not for that separation, I wouldn't have been able to accumulate the different [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=223.7s)]
*  kind of services that I did in order to get me to where I am today. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=229.0s)]
*  So when we know, and we've gained a lot, a lot of Intel over the last number of decades [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=233.64s)]
*  since the famous 1994 crime bill, which was authored by Joe Biden in case people don't [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=240.02s)]
*  know that exacerbated incarceration in this nation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=244.62s)]
*  And it also pulled services out of our carceral systems. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  And so, you know, so we have a lot of information at this point of what is needed, but we're [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=252.66s)]
*  denying people that opportunity. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=259.14s)]
*  We went from one end of the pendulum all the way over to this other side. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=261.38s)]
*  Harm reduction is inaction. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=265.58s)]
*  Inaction is actually inaction. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=268.74s)]
*  And what it is, is sending a message that no lives matter in this nation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=271.02000000000004s)]
*  Harm reduction is inaction. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=276.74s)]
*  Inaction says the message that no lives matter. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  I wish, I really hope that people are hearing you and that you get a chance to get your [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=280.98s)]
*  voice out there because I think it's very necessary. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=285.54s)]
*  Ginny Burton, thank you very much. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=287.38s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  We're changing your life. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=298.1s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6BWfbBFj4&t=299.3s)]
