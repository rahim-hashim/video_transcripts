# This is third-world election tampering: Victor Davis Hanson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k)
*  And of course, you already know who's coming next. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=0.0s)]
*  Victor Davis Hansen, a senior fellow [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=2.04s)]
*  at the Hoover Institution, joins us [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=3.62s)]
*  for the two minutes and 10 seconds we have left. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=5.12s)]
*  Professor, welcome. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=10.56s)]
*  Well, Tucker, I think that we're seeing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  war clouds gather abroad, and I think the United States [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=14.22s)]
*  economy, politically, foreign policy is at an endearer, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=17.2s)]
*  and we've lost now all credibility [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=20.62s)]
*  that we've stored up over 233. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=23.12s)]
*  We have no more moral credibility to lecture people [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=25.44s)]
*  about the democratic process, and your guests [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=28.72s)]
*  have spelled it out pretty well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=31.24s)]
*  They have an agenda to the left that does not appeal [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=32.64s)]
*  to 51% of the people, so they attack the process, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=34.88s)]
*  and they attack the candidate, and what we're seeing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=38.36s)]
*  is not the end of it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=41.16s)]
*  Tonight was the very beginning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=42.64s)]
*  This is gonna go on through three prosecutors [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=44.04s)]
*  for a year and a half with the intent [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  of getting just enough empathy for Donald Trump [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=48.94s)]
*  that he would be nominated, and then seeing him [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  gag-ordered, hemorrhaged, and maybe even incarcerated [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=54.36s)]
*  to nullify his viability in the general election. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=57.56s)]
*  So it's the worst example of third world election tampering, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  and they don't have a message, and so whether it's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=64.62s)]
*  symbolically tearing up the State of the Union, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=67.4s)]
*  or denying the minority leader in the House appointments, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=70.0s)]
*  or trying to threaten the filibuster to be ended, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=74.2s)]
*  or the Electoral College, or pack the court, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=77.68s)]
*  it's all processed because they don't have a message, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=81.0s)]
*  and they're desperate. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=83.68s)]
*  They're revolutionaries. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=84.64s)]
*  We're in the middle of a revolution [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=85.48s)]
*  and we don't even know that we're in. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=86.8s)]
*  I think Donald Trump said as much as he could, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  but I imagine that in the next week [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=91.28s)]
*  we'll see a gag order leveled against him, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=93.22s)]
*  and then the other prosecutors will be encouraged, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=95.52s)]
*  and this is gonna go on, this cycle drama's gonna go on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  for a year and a half. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=100.22s)]
*  Which is entirely the point. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=103.8s)]
*  Very quickly, is there not a single Democrat in Washington [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=104.84s)]
*  who cares about the country enough [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=107.72s)]
*  to say what you just said? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=109.9s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=113.06s)]
*  I think some people like Joe Manchin have spoken out, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=113.9s)]
*  but there's no Democratic Party anymore. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=117.41999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  It's not even a progressive party. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=120.05999999999999s)]
*  It's a woke, hardcore, leftist, revolutionary movement. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=122.02s)]
*  It has no popular support, but throughout history, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=125.41999999999999s)]
*  such movements didn't really need, they didn't need it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  They got power anyway. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=131.74s)]
*  Victor Davis Hanson, thank you so much. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETx4lyrPW1k&t=132.57999999999998s)]
