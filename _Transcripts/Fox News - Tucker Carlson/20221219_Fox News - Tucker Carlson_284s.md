# Journalist shares shocking footage at ‘all ages’ drag show
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4)

*  You're nine? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=34.3s)]
*  Oh my God. Aw, look at that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=35.699999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for whoever's mom is out here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=37.5s)]
*  Hello, you're reaching for my t***s. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=39.2s)]
*  Are you hungry? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=40.8s)]
*  Say, mommy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=41.9s)]
*  Mommy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=43.7s)]
*  Yeah, in case you were wondering if they were targeting kids. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=46.5s)]
*  They're literally targeting kids. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=49.0s)]
*  Here's more footage from the same event. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=50.3s)]
*  So glad is for this? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=57.9s)]
*  Human rights campaign is for this? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=84.7s)]
*  Oh, they're for it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=86.3s)]
*  It's happening all over the country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=87.8s)]
*  It's part of a national tour called the Drag Queen Christmas. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=89.0s)]
*  36 shows, 18 different states. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=91.8s)]
*  The reason you know what it's like inside and not just relying on the lies of NBC News and the Washington Post is because Taylor Hanson, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=94.7s)]
*  an independent journalist, went there and got that footage with the help of the Texas Family Project. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=100.0s)]
*  Twitter immediately suspended Hanson for telling the truth about what was going on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=105.2s)]
*  Amazingly, Taylor Hanson joins us tonight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=109.9s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=112.0s)]
*  So I think your video basically answers my questions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  This wasn't an adult thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=119.89999999999999s)]
*  This was a kid thing or kids there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  That was the point, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=125.5s)]
*  Yeah, you're completely right, Tucker. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=128.0s)]
*  I mean, this was marketed towards children in the flyer itself. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=129.2s)]
*  It literally says all ages and I don't know about you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=132.9s)]
*  I mean, but the video that I watched, it does not entail anything that includes, you know, it's appropriate for all ages in this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=135.7s)]
*  I mean, I'll let our audience come to their own conclusions about why someone would intentionally target children for this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=144.5s)]
*  And let me just say, if there were no kids there, we wouldn't be putting this on the air because it wouldn't be our business. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  But with kids there it is, I think. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=157.7s)]
*  Why would you be banned from telling the truth about what was going on inside? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=161.5s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=164.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's very interesting that, you know, I was almost immediately suspended after reporting on this and having it hit breaking news. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=166.6s)]
*  You know, the reason why I would be banned is because you have fake reporters, you know, like Will Carlos from USA Today, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=173.1s)]
*  amongst many other sources that want to come out and say, you know, there are no children there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=178.5s)]
*  I mean, they flat out deny this, even though that these children are essentially on video being sexually groomed. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=182.6s)]
*  I mean, there's no other way to put it is these children are being groomed by adults. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=189.5s)]
*  And outlets like USA Today pretend that they lie and they say that's not happening when this video shows that it is. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=195.5s)]
*  Why would they want to cover that up? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=203.3s)]
*  I really think it's all about the narrative game here, as you know, I've heard of something called drag phobia. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=207.2s)]
*  That's been popping up pretty recently in my mentions, you know, and I guess if I don't really know what that means, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=212.0s)]
*  but if drag phobia means that I am against, you know, full grown men dressed as women sexually dancing and committing lewd acts in front of minors intentionally, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=217.3s)]
*  then, you know, you could consider me drag phobic to say the least. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=227.5s)]
*  Yeah, I would say we're the dads here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=230.5s)]
*  I mean, why doesn't anyone put a stop to this again? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=232.3s)]
*  Just to be completely clear, doing this to kids is a crime and certainly a moral crime. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=235.3s)]
*  And I'm just amazed that people sit back and let it happen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=242.0s)]
*  But Taylor Hanson, I'm glad you mentioned the dads, Tucker. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=246.6s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=249.2s)]
*  Is there there actually is a common reoccurrence is there are no dads there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=250.0s)]
*  Ninety nine percent of the time is a lot of the people that bring these kids to these shows are single mothers who, you know, happen to be obese. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=254.1s)]
*  I don't know if there's a pattern there or what. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=261.2s)]
*  I mean, what if people are repulsed just like I am at recording this video? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=263.0s)]
*  They can visit DefendKidsTX.com to personally help me here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=267.1s)]
*  Appreciate it. Taylor Hanson. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcDOwH9UE4&t=271.9s)]
