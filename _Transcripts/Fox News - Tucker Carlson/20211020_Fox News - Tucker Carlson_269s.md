# Travis Tritt won't play in venues that enforce mandates
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU)
*  Well, here's something that's kind of sad but true. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=0.0s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of people may dislike something, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=2.72s)]
*  but in real life, nothing really changes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=5.36s)]
*  until powerful people stand up against it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=8.16s)]
*  And that's why this is a significant story. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=11.58s)]
*  Country music star Travis Tritt has announced [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=13.24s)]
*  he is canceling any performance in any venue [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=15.8s)]
*  that mandates masks, requires COVID vaccinations, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=18.0s)]
*  or pushes unreasonable COVID testing protocols. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=21.18s)]
*  Why is he doing this? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=23.88s)]
*  Travis Tritt joins us now to explain. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=25.26s)]
*  Travis Tritt, we are honored to have you on the show tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=27.2s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=28.68s)]
*  And I'm just gonna ask you to explain [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=30.56s)]
*  why you're doing this and let you talk. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=32.08s)]
*  Well, we've done about 75 shows so far this year [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=34.88s)]
*  all over the country, Tucker. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=39.72s)]
*  And in spite of the fact that some people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=41.16s)]
*  would try to label these as being quote unquote [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=44.92s)]
*  super spreaders, the actual numbers don't reflect [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=48.2s)]
*  that at all. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=52.66s)]
*  As a matter of fact, quite the opposite. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=53.5s)]
*  In most of these areas, we've seen the COVID numbers [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=55.2s)]
*  actually drop dramatically over the last few weeks and months. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=59.42s)]
*  And so it came as quite a shock to me and a lot of my fans [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=62.9s)]
*  when after the first week of October, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=68.5s)]
*  during the first week of October, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=71.5s)]
*  a lot of these shows had restrictions placed on them, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=73.74s)]
*  not by the state, not by the local city government, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=79.84s)]
*  not by the local health department, municipalities, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=84.28s)]
*  but by the actual promoters slash venue owners. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=87.5s)]
*  And there was nothing that justified it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=95.98s)]
*  And so I started getting a ton of messages from fans [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=98.14s)]
*  who were basically not warned about these mandates [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=104.92s)]
*  or restrictions ahead of time, showed up at the gate [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  and were turned away and were not even offered refunds. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=113.74s)]
*  They were offered credits to a upcoming show [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  that had to be used within the next 12 months [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=122.08s)]
*  or else they lose their money for tickets. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=125.58s)]
*  And it was just heartbreaking to me. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=127.36s)]
*  These people have been shut out from getting a chance [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=129.52s)]
*  to go see concerts for over a year. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=133.0s)]
*  And they're finally getting a chance to do that again. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=137.3s)]
*  And now they're being turned away [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=139.56s)]
*  for some unexplained reason. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=141.58s)]
*  So this is not about following the science [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=144.52s)]
*  or trying to look out for the safety of the people there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=149.22s)]
*  This is about something else. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=156.0s)]
*  This is trying to divide people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=157.16s)]
*  This is trying to shame people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=159.2s)]
*  This is trying to basically discriminate against people [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=161.3s)]
*  that they don't feel are, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=165.94s)]
*  clean enough to be a part of enjoying a concert like that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=172.48s)]
*  Man, that's so nicely put. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=178.64s)]
*  So the question is, you're not the only touring artist [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=180.78s)]
*  who's experiencing this, but you're one of the very few [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=184.66s)]
*  I'm aware of who said anything about it, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=187.46s)]
*  who said, I'm not putting up with this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=189.22s)]
*  I'm not going along with it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=190.4s)]
*  Why did you decide not to go along with this? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=192.12s)]
*  I mean, what, because you could have just ignored it [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=194.5s)]
*  like everyone else is. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=196.16s)]
*  You know, I come from a hardworking middle-class family [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=198.2s)]
*  and I have been extremely blessed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  I came from nothing to have a wonderful, wonderful career [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=205.2s)]
*  that has lasted for over 35 years in this business. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  And to see people that I know, I know these people, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=217.22s)]
*  these are hardworking Americans [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=222.18s)]
*  that just want to take care of their families, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=225.08s)]
*  put food on the table for their families, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  put a roof over their head and occasionally go out [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  and experience a concert, you know, enjoy themselves, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=233.26000000000002s)]
*  forget about all their troubles for a little while. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=239.46s)]
*  And to be able to enjoy all of those different things, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  that's something that I just, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=247.68s)]
*  I felt like I had to stand up for freedom, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=249.18s)]
*  freedom for all of those people to be able to go out [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  and do what they enjoy doing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=255.38s)]
*  and enjoy a concert without being harassed. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=256.98s)]
*  Man, and you were willing to lose money on that principle. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=260.76s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=263.82s)]
*  Credit to Country Music. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3vhPqGY4zU&t=264.66s)]
