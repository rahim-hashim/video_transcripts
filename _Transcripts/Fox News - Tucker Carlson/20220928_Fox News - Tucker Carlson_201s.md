# Tulsi Gabbard: This could lead to a 'nuclear holocaust'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas)
*  Tulsi Gabbard is a former member of Congress from Hawaii who from the very first day, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=0.0s)]
*  from February 24th when this war began, has been saying the exact same thing, which is the stakes [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=4.88s)]
*  are very high here. Maybe we should acknowledge that before we proceed heedlessly forward. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=9.76s)]
*  We're honored to have her join us again tonight. Congresswoman, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=14.32s)]
*  What do you make of this? We're reminded once again, Tucker, that we are unfortunately being [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=19.52s)]
*  led by leaders who are selfish and short-sighted and don't care about the American people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=26.72s)]
*  They are leading us further and further into war without understanding one of the most basic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=32.96s)]
*  tenets and characteristics of war, which is it is unpredictable. Once that first shot is fired, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=38.0s)]
*  once that first punch is thrown, the predictable nature of things, you can plan for things, but it [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=45.36s)]
*  by nature becomes unpredictable. They're like, oh my gosh, this thing has become sabotage. Well, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=52.0s)]
*  yeah, war is unpredictable. The thing that is not unpredictable, however, is the cost of war, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=58.16s)]
*  the suffering, the devastation, the destruction, the death that is caused by it. The real question [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=64.8s)]
*  for the American people and for us to ask our leaders is how much suffering will we have to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=70.48s)]
*  endure here in this country and for people around the world? Because as you've so clearly stated, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=75.52s)]
*  we see a sabotage of an energy pipeline today. What's next? Is it access to the internet? Is [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  it satellites that are connected to GPS that power virtually all parts of our life and also [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  our weapons systems go on down the line and we end up with this potential nuclear outcome? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  Our leaders are saying, well, hey, we can't do anything. This is all in Putin's hands. Well, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=99.6s)]
*  guess what? The United States, our leaders and European leaders are the ones fueling and funding [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=103.35999999999999s)]
*  this war. So they have a heck of a lot of leverage to be able to push for a ceasefire, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=108.8s)]
*  negotiated outcome and an end to this war and to actually fight for peace and prosperity. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=113.12s)]
*  And we need to know that if they're not doing that and they aren't right now, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=118.8s)]
*  then what they are doing is pushing for more destruction, more war, and therefore a lack of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  peace and prosperity and more suffering for us and people around the world. If it turns out that the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=129.6s)]
*  Biden administration actually blew up a natural gas pipeline or okayed someone else's sabotage [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=134.8s)]
*  of that pipeline, shouldn't there be a federal law that prevents them from lecturing the rest [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=141.52s)]
*  of us about climate change ever again? I don't have the evidence of who was responsible for this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=146.0s)]
*  There will be consequences if that is ever found out, but we have the reality of what we're dealing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=155.52s)]
*  with right before us today, which is if we continue down this path, we may end up with a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=162.24s)]
*  nuclear holocaust. And so for us and for millions of people around the world, what are we going to do [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=168.4s)]
*  about it? We've got to call on our leaders to actually take a stand and fight for peace, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=173.84s)]
*  fight for prosperity, fight for our future. Yeah. I mean, you kind of like your kids to be able to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=178.72s)]
*  grow up and stuff like that. Exactly. Tulsi Gabbard. Stuff like that. Yeah, stuff like that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=183.36s)]
*  I appreciate your comment. As always, thank you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HPG69vIas&t=188.32s)]
