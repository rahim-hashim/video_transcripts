# Tucker: Americans won't forgive Joe Biden for this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ)
*  Good evening and welcome to a special edition of Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Now it's hard to have a lot of faith in political polling, obviously, especially after the last [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=4.16s)]
*  couple of presidential elections. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=8.9s)]
*  The polls weren't just wrong in those elections, they were insane. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  They told us things like, oh no, Hillary could take Texas and Joe Biden's a lock to win Florida. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=14.0s)]
*  In the end, those predictions had no relationship to observable reality. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=19.36s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that all polling is worthless. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=24.38s)]
*  And if it is a relative measure over time, polls can provide a lot of historical context. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=27.5s)]
*  So Joe Biden's polls are in the toilet right now, everyone knows that, and the question is why. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=33.5s)]
*  You'll hear a lot of people say, well, it was Afghanistan, the true debacle that Biden oversaw in Afghanistan. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=38.3s)]
*  The question is that really it, however, is a foreign policy disaster enough to knock a president off his game in his first year in office? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=44.06s)]
*  Well, here are some comparisons. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  Gerald Ford's approval ratings after the fall of Saigon, those will be worth looking at. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=54.7s)]
*  The fall of Saigon was the most humiliating moment in this country's history up until that time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  The entire world watched as Americans ran from a peasant army, civilians dangled from helicopters, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=63.580000000000005s)]
*  taking off from the roof of the U.S. embassy in Saigon. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=69.9s)]
*  It was a catastrophe, one that became an enduring symbol of the incompetence of our foreign policy establishment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=72.9s)]
*  The U.S. had spent more than a decade in Vietnam, lost close to 60,000 men. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=79.14s)]
*  And after all of that, we ran away. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=83.3s)]
*  And yet, in the days after the fall of Saigon, Gerald Ford's poll numbers, as measured by Gallup, actually went up. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=85.74s)]
*  His approval rating increased from 39 to 40 percent. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=92.58s)]
*  Then just a month later, by the end of May, 1975, Ford's approval rating surged to 51 percent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=95.74s)]
*  So Gerald Ford, President Ford, oversaw an international embarrassment, but Americans gave him a pass. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=102.74s)]
*  They weren't done with him just yet. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  Something very similar happened during the John F. Kennedy administration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=111.42s)]
*  Kennedy was in charge during the Bay of Pigs invasion in April of 1961, which he singlehandedly turned into a disaster. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=115.33999999999999s)]
*  That disaster made Fidel Castro a national hero in Cuba and drove Cuba even closer to the Soviet Union. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=122.5s)]
*  All of this happened just before the Cuban Missile Crisis. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=129.94s)]
*  So that was not a good thing for anybody. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=132.7s)]
*  And yet, despite that, JFK's approval ratings did not drop. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  In fact, they went up from 78 percent to 83 percent in the days after the disaster. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=139.06s)]
*  So the Bay of Pigs happened in the first year of the Kennedy administration. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=144.18s)]
*  The fall of Saigon happened in the first year of the Ford administration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=146.98s)]
*  So it's hard not to conclude that when presidents are just starting out, Americans give them a pass, even on the big things, especially in foreign policy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=150.06s)]
*  So with that in mind, it's worth taking a look at how Joe Biden's approval numbers have changed during his first year in office. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=158.1s)]
*  And of course, it's an unequivocal disaster. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=164.26s)]
*  According to a new Quinnipiac poll, only 36 percent of Americans approve of the job Joe Biden is doing in office. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=166.54s)]
*  The RealClearPolitics polling average has Joe Biden doing only marginally better at about 41 percent. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=172.82s)]
*  Gallup has Biden at 42 percent, down 15 points from just a couple of months ago. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=178.62s)]
*  You should know that Kamala Harris's approval number is 28 percent, which is right around Jeffrey Dahmer level. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=183.62s)]
*  So two thirds of Americans do not want Joe Biden to run for president again, and that includes most Democrats. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=189.86s)]
*  Just 10 months into Biden's presidency, Americans want him gone. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=197.06s)]
*  So as a historical matter, that's unheard of. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  How bad is it? It's gotten so bad that college students, typically not a right wing demographic, are mocking Biden at football games. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=204.9s)]
*  So Biden is deeply unpopular. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=219.86s)]
*  The question is why? How did we get here? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=237.94000000000003s)]
*  That matters. And that's going to be our focus over the next hour on this show. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=240.66000000000003s)]
*  What we're witnessing under the Biden administration is something Americans will absolutely not forgive. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=244.54s)]
*  The decline in our standard of living. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=249.82s)]
*  Biden hasn't simply embarrassed the United States internationally, though he's certainly done that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  Americans can overlook that, as they did under Ford and JFK, and hope for something better next time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  Biden has made living in this country much more difficult for millions of people. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=262.46s)]
*  He's made it a lot harder for Americans to afford basic amenities, things like building supplies and gasoline. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=267.26s)]
*  And then he showed almost no interest in fixing this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=273.02s)]
*  In fact, it's clear it's being done on purpose because global warming. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=275.38s)]
*  One local news station in Florida has talked to restaurant owners about the effect of rising food prices, for example. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  Watch this from chicken wings. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=284.9s)]
*  It's one hundred and forty dollars a case versus what was forty dollars to plastic gloves. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=287.5s)]
*  They've gone from twenty dollars a case to one hundred and forty plus. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=293.06s)]
*  And again, sometimes it's hard to get those. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=297.97999999999996s)]
*  Nearly everything costs more. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  John Horn on FRLA's executive committee also owns Anna Maria Oyster Bars. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=302.7s)]
*  Supply issues are keeping favorites like Alaskan King crab legs and clam strips off the menu. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=307.58s)]
*  One of our most popular items. Can't get them from anyone. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=312.42s)]
*  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, major commodities in the Wholesale Food Price Index are way up since last year. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=315.82s)]
*  Beef rose fifty seven point seven percent. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=321.94s)]
*  Fat and oils nearly fifty percent. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=324.3s)]
*  Eggs almost forty percent and processed poultry thirty percent. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=326.46s)]
*  To offset that, menu prices on average are up four point seven percent. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=330.7s)]
*  What is this exactly? We can't get enough food? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=336.62s)]
*  A lot of things are happening and one of them is inflation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=340.46s)]
*  And inflation is not an active God. It's the result of government policy. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=342.5s)]
*  The Federal Reserve has devalued the U.S. dollar by printing too many U.S. dollars. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=346.78s)]
*  Why are they printing them? To pay for more government spending, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=351.62s)]
*  that under the Biden administration is now literally out of control. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=354.42s)]
*  There was a ten point one trillion dollar amount of spending obligations in fiscal year 2020. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=357.98s)]
*  Ten point one trillion. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=364.7s)]
*  2019, which wasn't ancient history, was the other day. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=366.94s)]
*  The total was six point six trillion. Still a lot, but very different than ten point one. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=369.86s)]
*  Now, the spending is, of course, on the way. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=375.62s)]
*  More spending is on the way because we can spend any amount of money. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=378.22s)]
*  We hold the world's reserve currency. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=381.54s)]
*  Biden's so-called build back better bill is estimated to cost under five trillion dollars. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=383.82s)]
*  So the people who are printing this money, the U.S. Congress, the Fed specifically, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=389.26s)]
*  know that they are making the problem worse, but they don't care. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=392.58s)]
*  In fact, they're mocking you for noticing that your standard of living has declined. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=396.02s)]
*  The St. Louis Fed has released this statement. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=399.61999999999995s)]
*  It's hard to miss the contempt here. This is real. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  Quote, a Thanksgiving dinner serving of poultry costs one dollar forty two cents. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=404.5s)]
*  A soybean based dinner serving with the same amount of calories costs 66 cents [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=410.46s)]
*  and provides almost twice as much protein. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=415.82s)]
*  End quote. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=418.38s)]
*  Of course, being soy based also lowers your testosterone level, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=419.78s)]
*  which, of course, is the entire point of this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=422.46s)]
*  But it's just interesting that the Fed, which is supposed to be focused on keeping inflation under control. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=424.5s)]
*  That's why we have a Fed, is now telling you what to eat. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=428.38s)]
*  How did this happen? How long till they're telling you to eat bugs to stop climate change? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=432.74s)]
*  Not far, not far from that at all. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=436.17999999999995s)]
*  In the Biden administration, a host of bureaucratic agencies are suddenly in charge of your body. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=438.82s)]
*  The minute details of your body. What you have for Thanksgiving dinner. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=442.9s)]
*  The White House believes that OSHA, for example, can tell you what to inject into your body. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=447.34s)]
*  Get the injection or you're fired. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=451.62s)]
*  Now, you remember that just a few months ago, the White House was saying the opposite of this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=453.74s)]
*  Vaccine mandates are illegal. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=457.02s)]
*  I don't think it should be mandatory. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=458.78s)]
*  I wouldn't demand to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=460.18s)]
*  Just like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=463.7s)]
*  Can we mandate vaccines across the country? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=467.18s)]
*  No, that's not a role that the federal government, I think, even has the power to make. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=469.46s)]
*  We cannot require someone to be vaccinated. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=473.62s)]
*  That's just not what we can do. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=477.46s)]
*  It is a matter of privacy to know who is or who isn't. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=480.06s)]
*  No, definitely not. You don't want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=483.74s)]
*  We've never done that. We don't want to be mandating from the federal government to the general population. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=488.86s)]
*  It would be unenforceable and not appropriate. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=494.1s)]
*  These people are reckless and crazy and dishonest, and the rest of us put up with it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=498.38s)]
*  After all that, after everything you just saw, of course, they mandated the injections. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=502.54s)]
*  They knew that was illegal. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=505.78000000000003s)]
*  Just as we saw with the eviction ban, they did it anyway. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=507.54s)]
*  Then the airlines started canceling flights. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeJS3NjLDQ&t=510.42s)]
