# The woke mob is never satisfied: Fired radio host
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs)
*  So there are a million censorship stories out there, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=0.0s)]
*  but every once in a while you see one [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=2.54s)]
*  that's just actually pretty unbelievable. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=3.72s)]
*  And this is one of them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=5.66s)]
*  So Amber Athey was a talk show host [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  on a conservative news station in Washington called WML, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=8.2s)]
*  which is a good station. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Then she made the mistake of tweeting a joke [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=12.8s)]
*  about the color of Kamala Harris's pantsuit [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=15.56s)]
*  during the State of the Union. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=17.76s)]
*  And we're just gonna read it to you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=18.76s)]
*  because it's like, it's not anything to be embarrassed of. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=19.68s)]
*  Here's what it said, quote, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=21.86s)]
*  Kamala Harris looks like a UPS employee. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=23.0s)]
*  What can Brown do for you? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=25.32s)]
*  Nothing good, apparently. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=26.76s)]
*  Okay, so that's a joke based on the UPS slogan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=28.419999999999998s)]
*  It's like, not that far out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=31.06s)]
*  It's certainly not hateful. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=32.36s)]
*  But a few days later, a left-wing activist group [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=34.3s)]
*  pretended that they were deeply upset [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=37.3s)]
*  because it was racist, so they called on Cumulus, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=38.739999999999995s)]
*  which owns WML, to fire her. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=40.98s)]
*  And she was fired. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=44.14s)]
*  And unlike most people who get fired, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=45.32s)]
*  she fought back in a big way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  She got a great piece on this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=48.06s)]
*  in The Spectator of London today. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  She joins us right now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=50.46s)]
*  Amber, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  It feels like in this story, we're missing part of it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=54.66s)]
*  Like, that's the tweet, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  and then you get fired on what grounds? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=60.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great point, Tucker. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=64.14s)]
*  I wish that there was more to the story [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  because this is so infuriating. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=67.74s)]
*  But I have a termination letter [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=70.06s)]
*  that lays out in very specific detail [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=71.82s)]
*  that it was, in fact, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=74.4s)]
*  this tweet about Kamala Harris's outfit. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=75.94s)]
*  And I think what happened here is that Cumulus thought, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=78.46s)]
*  and Cumulus is the parent company for WML, as you mentioned, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=81.98s)]
*  that they could just make this all go away. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=85.14s)]
*  They could get these few activist emails. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=87.46s)]
*  They could appease the mob if they just fired me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=89.1s)]
*  Well, their first mistake was that the woke mob [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  is never satisfied. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=93.58s)]
*  They always want more scouts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=94.9s)]
*  And the second mistake that they made [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=96.7s)]
*  is they thought that I was just going to roll over [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=98.32s)]
*  and shut up about this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=100.66s)]
*  Well, that's not who I am. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=102.18s)]
*  I believe very deeply that we are all obligated [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=103.86s)]
*  to speak out when injustices occur in our society. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=106.62s)]
*  And so I intended, as soon as I got fired, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=110.5s)]
*  to very loudly and proudly tell everybody [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=113.46s)]
*  about what happened to me [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=116.1s)]
*  because I think we live in a very perverse [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=117.28s)]
*  and sick society, Tucker, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=119.56s)]
*  when a young woman from a working class background [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=121.62s)]
*  with parents who didn't go to college [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=124.56s)]
*  can't criticize the outfit [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=126.18s)]
*  of the most powerful woman in the United States. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=128.78s)]
*  And worse than that, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=131.46s)]
*  the most powerful woman in the United States [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=132.34s)]
*  is actually considered the marginalized victim [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=134.62s)]
*  in this scenario. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=137.12s)]
*  You beat me to it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=139.22s)]
*  I was going to point that out. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=140.66s)]
*  So the most powerful woman in the United States [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=142.78s)]
*  is the marginalized victim [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=145.1s)]
*  and the big soulless, creepy woke company takes her side [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=147.1s)]
*  using, I assume it's HR department [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=151.7s)]
*  because that's usually their NKVD. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be happy to share the names of the two people [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=156.18s)]
*  who actually called me to fire me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  So Jeff Bowden is the vice president [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  of Cumulus Operations in Washington, DC. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=162.18s)]
*  Kristen Fancellas is the vice president [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  of the Human Resources Department for Cumulus. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=167.54s)]
*  And they told me straight up on this phone call [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=170.38s)]
*  that they believed that the Kamala Harris tweet [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=172.88s)]
*  about her outfit was in fact racist [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=175.06s)]
*  and violated this vague social media policy [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=177.62s)]
*  that basically says you can't do anything [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=180.7s)]
*  that would bring reputational harm upon the company, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=182.66s)]
*  which just means that they put that in there [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=185.26s)]
*  so that they can fire people for any reason that they want. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=187.44s)]
*  Did, I mean, I guess this is a rhetorical question, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=190.7s)]
*  but did they explain how it was racist [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=192.82s)]
*  that you weren't impressed by her outfit? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=195.46s)]
*  Did they get specific or they just call you names [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=198.16s)]
*  and fire you? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=199.44s)]
*  No, they just called me names and fired me [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=200.48s)]
*  and I tried to defend myself [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=202.4s)]
*  but wasn't really offered the opportunity. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  And I'm told that in subsequent meetings [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=206.44s)]
*  about this situation, they actually admitted [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=208.4s)]
*  that they didn't really think that the tweet was racist. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  What really mattered to them was the perception [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  of it being racist by these really bad faith, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=216.29999999999998s)]
*  dishonest left-wing actors. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=219.4s)]
*  Okay, can you just repeat after me [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=221.76s)]
*  because I know you're now looking for work. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=223.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris looks bold, beautiful and sassy tonight. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=224.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris, I can't do it, Tucker. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=229.0s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=231.4s)]
*  Well, I hope someone hires you and soon. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=232.24s)]
*  I know the spectator already has. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=236.48s)]
*  Amber, great to see you tonight, thank you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=237.56s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVFPEyW85Xs&t=238.96s)]
