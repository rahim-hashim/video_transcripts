# Ukranian members of parliament take up arms, join citizens on the street to fight Russians
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU)
*  So you're reading all kinds of reports about Ukrainian citizens taking up arms, being given [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=0.0s)]
*  arms to fend off Russian invaders. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=4.36s)]
*  Politicians, apparently, are doing the same. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=6.84s)]
*  One of them is a Ukrainian member of parliament. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=9.0s)]
*  His name is Sevea Tisla-Vyurash, and he joins us tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=12.48s)]
*  Mr. Vyurash, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=16.8s)]
*  So I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can, are you personally taking up arms [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=19.84s)]
*  to repel the invaders? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=26.7s)]
*  Yes, the reality is we are in Kiev. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=29.16s)]
*  We are being sieged right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=32.2s)]
*  And this is a capital, the largest European state that is basically under the full-scale [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=34.28s)]
*  invasion of Russia, that is trying to destroy it, annihilate it, and take it over in every [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=38.92s)]
*  single way. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=44.64s)]
*  The point here, there is no citizen that is not thinking about what he will do when Russia [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=45.72s)]
*  tries to take over the city. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=52.0s)]
*  And those millions of people in this town are taking up arms, taking up any instrument [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=54.04s)]
*  they can to try and resist. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=58.04s)]
*  Have you seen, speaking for yourself, have you seen Russian forces within the city? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=61.8s)]
*  Yes, we have seen Russian forces. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=68.0s)]
*  There have been skirmishes with various saboteur groups. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=70.4s)]
*  They've been trying to get into the city. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=73.2s)]
*  We are capturing their POWs by the hundreds all over Ukraine now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=75.2s)]
*  As far as Kiev is concerned, we have them moving from the north, trying through the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=78.8s)]
*  east. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=84.0s)]
*  They are trying to encircle the city, basically. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=85.0s)]
*  The south and west is mostly open. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=88.0s)]
*  And again, we are trying to keep it that way by taking over, taking back towns in the west [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=91.0s)]
*  of Kiev and basically in those front lines. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=96.8s)]
*  And that's the point of trying to basically keep our city ours. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=100.0s)]
*  Do you plan to stay? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=107.0s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=110.0s)]
*  Our president is very near where I'm standing right now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=111.0s)]
*  Whole the government is staying in Kiev. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=115.0s)]
*  It is our capital city. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=118.0s)]
*  We aren't going to just give it up. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=119.0s)]
*  Again, this is our country and we don't want to allow Putin's illusions of grandeur, destroy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=121.0s)]
*  our dreams of independence, of liberty. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=128.0s)]
*  And we will fight for that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=132.0s)]
*  Has there been a lot of fighting in, say, the neighborhoods around Kiev? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=134.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=140.0s)]
*  There have been lots of fighting in the north of Kiev. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=141.0s)]
*  They got in with a very big column to there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=143.0s)]
*  They are trying to move through Chernobyl, endangering whole of Europe by taking over [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=146.0s)]
*  the plant and trying to, again, basically spin it out of control and moving through [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=150.0s)]
*  that lot of heavy machinery, artillery and infantry. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=155.0s)]
*  And basically, they got into north of Kiev. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=160.0s)]
*  And citizens there basically rallied around the attempt to just destroy them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=163.0s)]
*  And they had pushed them out of the city, basically. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=169.0s)]
*  The fighting right now is heaviest around the city. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=172.0s)]
*  And the limits, we are just facing various sub-atural groups that we can push back. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=175.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=182.0s)]
*  Well, Godspeed. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=183.0s)]
*  Good luck to you as you do that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=184.0s)]
*  Thank you, Taka. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=186.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxt9d7K2HU&t=199.0s)]
