# Tucker: Bad things are happening
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=0.0s)]
*  Here is the main thing you need to know about Joe Biden. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=4.0s)]
*  He is 82, 80 years old rather. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=7.12s)]
*  He was born in 1942 in the first half of the last century. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=9.84s)]
*  The year Biden was born, only 36% of American households had a telephone. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=14.44s)]
*  Nearly half of them did not have indoor plumbing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=18.64s)]
*  Joe Biden turned 80 last November. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=21.32s)]
*  This fall he will be 81. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  If Biden were to serve a second full term as president, he would be 86 years old. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  In other words, four years from 90. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=29.24s)]
*  These are not trivial facts about Joe Biden. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=31.84s)]
*  These are the central facts of Joe Biden's life. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=34.4s)]
*  Joe Biden's age defines him and all of us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=37.64s)]
*  That's true for every person. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=40.2s)]
*  Age is just a number, you will hear people say, but they are lying to themselves. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=42.04s)]
*  Age is more than a number. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=45.64s)]
*  Age is an expression of the core biological reality of human existence, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=47.28s)]
*  which is that at some point it comes to a close. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=51.04s)]
*  Age is the way that we chart our progression from birth to death [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=53.64s)]
*  as we pass from this world, as billions before us have and are replaced by others. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=56.6s)]
*  That used to be called the cycle of life. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=61.88s)]
*  No one has ever changed it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=63.56s)]
*  No one ever will. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=65.0s)]
*  So our choice is between accepting a reality we cannot alter [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=66.6s)]
*  or denying that reality even exists. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  The Democratic Party has chosen the latter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=73.8s)]
*  Tomorrow is March 1st. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=76.6s)]
*  That means a year from today we will be in the middle of presidential primary season. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden has given every indication that he plans to participate in that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=82.48s)]
*  and that his party is firmly behind him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=86.28s)]
*  The DNC has already changed the primary calendar to make South Carolina, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=88.68s)]
*  which is a machine state where the outcome can easily be scripted, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=91.88s)]
*  the very first contest. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=95.4s)]
*  And that was not an accident. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  It was done. It was changed to help Joe Biden win. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=98.36s)]
*  Biden says he's strongly considering running again. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=102.44s)]
*  Biden's wife, of course, says she very much hopes he will run. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=104.6s)]
*  And most tellingly of all, no mainstream Democrat has announced a run against him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=108.28s)]
*  So as of tonight, Joe Biden is in the race for the Democratic nomination [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=113.88s)]
*  and as of tonight, he will get the nomination. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=117.56s)]
*  And that's just amazing if you think about it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=120.44s)]
*  Joe Biden would be 82 years old on Inauguration Day. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=123.08s)]
*  That is eight years older than the average life expectancy for men in this country. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  So virtually everyone in his high school class will be gone by then, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=130.6s)]
*  but Joe Biden will be just beginning his second term as president of the United States. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=134.12s)]
*  Would that be healthy for America? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=139.48s)]
*  Would it be healthy for Joe Biden? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=141.24s)]
*  Of course not. It's awful. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=143.48s)]
*  82 year old men should not be running countries. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=145.48s)]
*  They're not strong enough mentally or physically. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=147.88s)]
*  Everybody knows that, very much including any 82 year old man you ask. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=149.88s)]
*  The people around Joe Biden certainly know that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=154.92s)]
*  How could they not know that? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  They watch him and you do too. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden in Warsaw, Poland just last week. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=161.48s)]
*  The questions we faced were as simple as they were profound. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=165.32s)]
*  Would we respond or would we look the other way? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=169.0s)]
*  Would we be strong or would we be weak? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=172.28s)]
*  Would we, all of our allies, would be united or divided? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=175.96s)]
*  So we play clips like that a million times for you over the past few years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=182.92s)]
*  We could play a million more because Joe Biden talks like that every day. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=186.04s)]
*  At this point, it's how he talks. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=190.6s)]
*  Joe Biden is losing his ability to speak. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=192.36s)]
*  That's not a secret. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=194.6s)]
*  It's not something you learn from our confidential sources. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=195.64s)]
*  It's not something you learn from our confidential sources and are bringing to you for the first time tonight exclusively. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=197.96s)]
*  That is obvious to the entire world. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=201.88s)]
*  And you'll probably sound like that too if you make it to Joe Biden's age. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=204.28s)]
*  We will also. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=207.0s)]
*  It's not weird. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=208.44s)]
*  It's natural. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  It's not an attack on Joe Biden. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=211.32s)]
*  Hardly. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=213.0s)]
*  It's an observation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=213.8s)]
*  But because it's natural, we have been commanded to ignore it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Don LaMonde got suspended from his show at CNN recently for suggesting that a presidential candidate in her 50s was, quote, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=220.68s)]
*  past her prime. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=226.52s)]
*  And that's odd, really. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=227.8s)]
*  As a factual matter, what Don LaMonde said is true. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=229.32s)]
*  People in their 50s are literally, certainly physically past their prime. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=232.12s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=235.24s)]
*  Take it from someone who's 53. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  So why was that such a controversial point? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=238.76s)]
*  Of all the demented things that Don LaMonde has said over the years, noticing somebody's age is what blows up his career? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=241.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=249.48s)]
*  Because that simple commonplace observation, people weaken with age, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=250.68s)]
*  points to a power that will forever remain beyond human authority, which is the power to control time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=255.56s)]
*  No matter how rich we are, we cannot prevent ourselves from getting older. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=263.0s)]
*  We can buy Botox and hair plugs and facelifts. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=267.32s)]
*  Joe Biden has bought all of that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=269.96s)]
*  But in the end, we degrade anyway because we are not God. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=271.96s)]
*  Accepting this fact that we are not God, working within the preordained limits of nature, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=276.68s)]
*  is the key to balance and happiness in this human life. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=281.72s)]
*  Ignoring that fact leads to insanity. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  Or in the case of modern America, it leads to the trans agenda and climate theology. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=289.16s)]
*  If you asked a hundred honest people to name the things that human beings cannot control, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  most would list biological sex and the weather. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=298.36s)]
*  You can't decide whether you're a boy or a girl. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=301.8s)]
*  You are what you are born. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=303.8s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=305.48s)]
*  And nobody, try as we might, can make a sunny day. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  You don't manufacture it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=310.12s)]
*  You receive it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=311.32s)]
*  A sunny day either happens or it doesn't. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=312.36s)]
*  It's not up to you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=314.36s)]
*  At best, we can try to predict the weather. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=315.8s)]
*  We cannot determine the weather. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  Since the dawn of time, that has been so obvious that almost nobody's ever mentioned it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=319.32s)]
*  But saying it out loud is now heresy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's because our leadership class is at open war with nature. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=326.44s)]
*  Nature is the final limit to their power. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=329.96s)]
*  And so they hate it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=332.2s)]
*  They tell us they're in charge of human biology, even of DNA. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=333.56s)]
*  Trans women are women, they screech. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=336.36s)]
*  Meet our lady, Admiral. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=338.28s)]
*  They brag about how they now control the weather. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=340.36s)]
*  Too hot for you? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=342.36s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=343.08s)]
*  We'll change that with the Green New Deal. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=343.4s)]
*  And then they tell us, of course, that age no longer matters. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=345.56s)]
*  Joe Biden may live forever. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=347.64s)]
*  We've got AI now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=348.84s)]
*  It's all a ridiculous fantasy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=350.68s)]
*  They have no such power. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=352.76s)]
*  They can't even keep the electrical grid running in the state of California. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=353.8s)]
*  And on some level, they know that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=357.32s)]
*  They know how limited they are, which is why they become so hysterical [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=358.76s)]
*  in the face of physical reality, because it's a reminder of their limits. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=363.0s)]
*  Do you remember this fall when that NBC reporter, a woman called Dasha Burns, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=366.68s)]
*  dared to point out that John Fetterman's stroke had damaged him? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=370.36s)]
*  Well, of course it had damaged him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=373.8s)]
*  Everyone could see it had damaged him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=375.08s)]
*  But to Fetterman's wife and the rest of the Democratic establishment [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=377.56s)]
*  and the rest of the press corps saying something like that out loud [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  was more offensive than any obscenity. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=383.4s)]
*  Here's an outraged Mrs. Fetterman. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=386.04s)]
*  What a disservice that she did to not only my husband, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=388.92s)]
*  to not only my husband, but to anyone facing a disability and working through it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=392.2s)]
*  And I don't know how there were not consequences, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=398.28s)]
*  I mean, there are consequences for folks in these positions who are any of the isms. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, she was ableist. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=405.96s)]
*  Well, she's an ableist, how Giselle Fetterman, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  because someone had correctly pointed out that her husband was no longer able [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=411.48s)]
*  because he had a stroke. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=415.96s)]
*  In other words, reality intruded on Mrs. Fetterman's fantasy [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=417.0s)]
*  and therefore reality itself had to be shouted down and destroyed. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=421.24s)]
*  You're seeing an awful lot of this attitude, that exact attitude recently [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=426.68s)]
*  from the people in charge. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=430.92s)]
*  It's not a healthy sign. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=432.12s)]
*  Wise leaders recognize the limits, the inherent limits of their power. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=434.04s)]
*  They know that they're not in control of much actually because no one is. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=438.44s)]
*  You can decide what to have for breakfast, that's up to you. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=442.68s)]
*  But you cannot decide to become a woman. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  You can't choose to live to 100. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=447.88s)]
*  You can't even choose to think clearly at 80. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=450.04s)]
*  None of that is your choice, even if you're the president. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=452.68s)]
*  Life, unfortunately, is a sexually transmitted, invariably fatal condition. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=456.68s)]
*  That's not a bad thing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=461.72s)]
*  It's just true. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  And when you deny it, bad things happen. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=464.36s)]
*  And they are. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FNbz6qpYY&t=467.88s)]
