# Film set veteran reacts to Alec Baldwin charges
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso)
*  Probably not surprising, but interesting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=0.0s)]
*  Stu Brumba is an actor, key grip, and owner of Sparta Grip. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=1.62s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=4.42s)]
*  Stu, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=5.22s)]
*  So you've seen this. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  I mean, the rest of us would, I guess, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=8.06s)]
*  assume that a lot of actors who are, of course, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=10.06s)]
*  against the Second Amendment probably [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=13.14s)]
*  don't know a lot about guns. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=14.86s)]
*  But you're saying you have seen actors mishandle firearms. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=16.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=20.98s)]
*  Thanks for having me on, first of all, Tucker. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=21.66s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=23.22s)]
*  But yeah, in my industry, we deal [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=24.14s)]
*  with a lot of firearm scenarios. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=26.98s)]
*  Obviously, we've got a lot of Hollywood people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=29.08s)]
*  that will vilify firearms and then end up [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  on their TV shows and movies and glorify them [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=35.08s)]
*  in those instances. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=37.8s)]
*  And it's just the hypocrisy of it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=39.0s)]
*  I try and be professional on set, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=43.6s)]
*  but you run into those instances where [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=44.84s)]
*  you've watched somebody make statements on their TV [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=46.56s)]
*  shows or their interviews. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=50.0s)]
*  And then you see them on the sets working, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=52.4s)]
*  and then they're trying to be using the firearms. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=55.12s)]
*  It's just comical. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=60.419999999999995s)]
*  Well, it's a little weird that people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=62.66s)]
*  who think guns are evil would be, as you said, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=65.82s)]
*  glorifying their use, playing the tough guy, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=68.97999999999999s)]
*  pointing guns in people's faces on the set. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=72.86s)]
*  I mean, have you ever seen an actor decline a role [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=75.14s)]
*  because it involved guns? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=79.86s)]
*  I'm sure the paychecks far outweigh their feelings [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=82.38s)]
*  towards firearms. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=87.58s)]
*  So I guess it goes without saying [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=89.86s)]
*  that a lot of these are people who really just don't know [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=91.74s)]
*  anything about firearms. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=94.14s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  You see them have these conversations on the news [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  channels and with politicians and everything else [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=99.74s)]
*  about firearms. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=101.82s)]
*  And then you hear things. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=102.72s)]
*  I mean, I grew up around guns. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  I grew up in Montana. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=105.17999999999999s)]
*  I'm an avid outdoorsman. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=106.06s)]
*  I've been hunting my entire life. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=107.1s)]
*  And you hear them talk about firearms, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=109.12s)]
*  and they totally don't understand even [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=113.08s)]
*  the mechanics of them to begin with. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=115.04s)]
*  And they're trying to make their point across of why [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=117.28s)]
*  they're so bad and evil and everything else. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=119.8s)]
*  And honest, hardworking citizens that love guns [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=121.52s)]
*  and my guns have never harmed anybody [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=127.04s)]
*  or never been in the hands of anybody that would do harm. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=129.36s)]
*  And you just look at those scenarios, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=131.68s)]
*  and then you kind of have to keep quiet on these movie sets [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=134.96s)]
*  and end up working with these individuals. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=137.48s)]
*  And not just you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  I've been on lots of different sets. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=141.72s)]
*  And there is this huge divide between the people who [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=144.44s)]
*  are getting paid the most and who are on camera, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=146.92s)]
*  and then everybody, the army of people off camera [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  who you never see. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=152.12s)]
*  I would say the majority of whom don't share the politics [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  of the people on camera. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=156.2s)]
*  Has that been your experience? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=157.2s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=158.64s)]
*  In my industry, there's always the conversations [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  behind the camera. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=163.42s)]
*  And I think a lot of people probably [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=164.72s)]
*  feel very similar to the way that I feel [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  when it comes to these issues. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=169.88s)]
*  But of course, we're not making the $10 million paycheck. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=172.68s)]
*  So we're just there to do our job [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  and do it to the best of our ability. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=177.0s)]
*  Well, I for one wish you were making the $10 million paycheck. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=179.68s)]
*  I do too. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=183.16s)]
*  Thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqJYQiahso&t=184.52s)]
