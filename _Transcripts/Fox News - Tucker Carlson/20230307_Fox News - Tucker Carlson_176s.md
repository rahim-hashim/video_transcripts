# There is some really strange behavior on Jan 6 footage: Top Republican
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA)
*  and Thomas Massey serves in the Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=0.0s)]
*  He did then, he does now, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  he represents the Commonwealth of Kentucky. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=3.64s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=5.76s)]
*  I have never seen members of Congress [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=7.72s)]
*  accuse the other, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=10.48s)]
*  I mean, there's usually a kind of fraternity [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=11.6s)]
*  in the Congress, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  you're all members of Congress, 435, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=13.88s)]
*  accuse their colleagues unfairly [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=15.8s)]
*  without any evidence at all of committing felonies. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  What's your response to this, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=22.84s)]
*  to the lying from your colleagues in the Congress? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=24.12s)]
*  You've exposed so many lies tonight with these tapes [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=27.38s)]
*  that it's changed my perception [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=31.5s)]
*  of what happened two years ago, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=33.94s)]
*  and I was there, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=35.46s)]
*  the tapes of people milling peacefully about. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=36.78s)]
*  And my hats off to your producers [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=40.1s)]
*  for sitting over there and going through hours of this, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=42.42s)]
*  but I would love to unleash the resourcefulness [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=44.66s)]
*  of the American public on these videos. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  I think they should be released, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  I think it's poppycock that they can't be released [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=54.26s)]
*  because of some security issues. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=57.339999999999996s)]
*  Look, I'm the one who's supposed to be secured [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=59.58s)]
*  by these buildings, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=62.62s)]
*  and I'm not worried about releasing them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=63.7s)]
*  They need to be released. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=66.1s)]
*  In fact, there was a Rasmussen poll that just came out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=67.22s)]
*  This showed over 80%, 78% of Democrats [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=70.86s)]
*  and 86% of Republicans say that all the videos [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=74.58s)]
*  should be released, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=77.62s)]
*  and they should because as you said, Tucker, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=79.1s)]
*  you didn't have facial recognition software there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=81.98s)]
*  We also need a complete catalog [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  of all of the feds who were there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=88.62s)]
*  Tell us who they were, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=90.76s)]
*  let's watch the videos and let's see what they did [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  because there's some really strange behavior [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=95.2s)]
*  on those videos of people behind the police lines [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=98.62s)]
*  in plain clothes, like touching them on the shoulder, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=101.7s)]
*  talking in their ear, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=104.14s)]
*  walking around boundaries as if they weren't even there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=105.64s)]
*  It's very odd. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=109.18s)]
*  I'm the one who asked Merrick Garland, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=111.02s)]
*  I showed him the tape of Ray Epps. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=112.5s)]
*  The Democrats didn't like it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=115.1s)]
*  I had to show it on an iPad for Merrick Garland to watch it, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=116.42s)]
*  and then he refused to say how many feds were there, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=120.22s)]
*  but that was also in the Rasmussen poll. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=123.0s)]
*  57% of Democrats think that it's at least somewhat likely [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=125.66s)]
*  that feds, agents of the federal government, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=130.5s)]
*  were not just there, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=133.62s)]
*  but were also encouraging people to riot [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=135.18s)]
*  or go into the Capitol. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=137.72s)]
*  It's very clear from the footage [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=139.88s)]
*  that our producers bravely slogged through for three weeks [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=141.92s)]
*  and God bless them for doing it, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=145.2s)]
*  that that's exactly right, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=146.68s)]
*  that federal agents encouraged the violence that day. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=147.92s)]
*  We're just a TV show and we can't show people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=150.88s)]
*  without proof of who they really were, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=154.88s)]
*  but I agree with your assessment completely. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=157.46s)]
*  That obviously happened. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Congressman Thomas Massey of Kentucky, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=161.0s)]
*  thank you so much for coming on. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjyxCcA2oA&t=164.56s)]
