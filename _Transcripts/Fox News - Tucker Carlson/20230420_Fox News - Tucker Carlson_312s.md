# Larry Elder joins the growing 2024 field
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas)
*  Larry Elder has been in California media forever telling the truth in a really smart and sometimes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=0.0s)]
*  hilarious way. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=9.84s)]
*  He just ran for governor of California in a recall election against Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=11.72s)]
*  He came up short after the state's media united to call him a white supremacist. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=17.12s)]
*  Still makes us laugh. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=22.92s)]
*  It's pretty offensive actually, but he's not deterred. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=23.92s)]
*  He has a major announcement for us tonight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=26.68s)]
*  Our friend Larry Elder joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=28.96s)]
*  Larry, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=30.8s)]
*  And I'm sorry to laugh at that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=32.72s)]
*  I'm sure it's hard for you to laugh at, but it's just so insane. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=33.72s)]
*  So what are you up to next? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=37.44s)]
*  Well Tucker, you almost have to laugh at it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=39.44s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=40.88s)]
*  And actually the actual quote was Larry Elder is the black face of white supremacy, Tucker. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=41.88s)]
*  And the sub headline was, you've been warned. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  By the way, one other LA Times columnist referred to my views as white supremacist. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Because I'm pro-life. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't buy the notion that America is systemically racist because I want secure borders, because [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=55.48s)]
*  I want us to be energy independent instead of energy dependent, because I know that our [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=60.16s)]
*  urban schools are a disaster. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=65.56s)]
*  So for all those reasons, I was called the black face of white supremacy and a white [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  supremacist in terms of my views. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=71.32s)]
*  My announcement, Tucker, is that I'm announcing that I'm running for the presidency of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  United States on your program. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=77.08s)]
*  And thank you so much for giving me this honor and this platform. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=78.88s)]
*  My website is elderforpresident.com. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  And Tucker, the reason I'm doing this is because my father was a World War II vet. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  He served on the island of Guam. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=91.48s)]
*  He was a Marine. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=94.0s)]
*  First black Marines. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=95.68s)]
*  They were called Montfort Point Marines. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=96.68s)]
*  My older brother, my late older brother Kirk, was in the Navy during the Vietnam era and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=97.68s)]
*  my little brother Dennis actually served in Vietnam in the Army. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=102.4s)]
*  I'm the only one who didn't serve and I don't feel good about that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  I feel I have a moral, a religious, and a patriotic duty to give back to a country that's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  been so good to my family and to me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=112.48s)]
*  And that is why I'm doing this, Tucker. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=114.48s)]
*  Well, that's amazing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=116.48s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=117.84s)]
*  It's a big decision to make. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=118.84s)]
*  Very familiar with your views. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=121.28s)]
*  I think I agree with all of them pretty much. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=122.28s)]
*  But if you were to narrow it down, just pick one or two, the issues that are animating [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  you that are making you feel like you've got to put everything on hold and do this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=128.88s)]
*  What are they? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=132.84s)]
*  Well, aside from the obvious things about the borders I mentioned before, the crime, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=133.84s)]
*  the maligning of the police, there are a couple of things that I think our side does not spend [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=137.76s)]
*  enough time talking about. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=141.88s)]
*  And that is the lie, the absolute disgraceful lie that the Democrats put on everything, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=143.36s)]
*  which is that America is systemically racist. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  It isn't just a lie, Tucker. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=149.4s)]
*  It's having real consequences. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=151.24s)]
*  The police are pulling back. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=153.28s)]
*  It's called the Ferguson effect or the George Floyd effect. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=154.36s)]
*  And the people who are harmed by that are the very black and brown people that people [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=157.32s)]
*  on the left claim they care about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=160.52s)]
*  There's been a study that shows hundreds, if not thousands of people are now dead because [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=162.12s)]
*  the police are not engaging in proactive policing because they've been demoralized by people [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=166.56s)]
*  calling them racist. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=170.2s)]
*  The second thing, Tucker, is the 10,000 pound elephant in the room regarding all of this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=171.36s)]
*  stuff we see in Chicago and some of these other cities with these mass mobs is the lack [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=176.36s)]
*  of fathers in the home. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=181.12s)]
*  Right now, today in America, 40 percent of all kids enter the world without a father [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=183.0s)]
*  in the home married to the mother, 70 percent in the black community, 50 percent of Hispanics, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  25 percent of whites. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Now that's the same percentage as was the case of blacks back in 1965. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=193.08s)]
*  The question we should be asking ourselves is how do we go from having 25 percent of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=196.8s)]
*  black kids entering the world in 1965 without a father in the home married to the mother [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  to 70 percent today? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=204.92s)]
*  And the answer is the welfare state. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=205.92s)]
*  We've incentivized women to marry the government. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  We've incentivized men to abandon their financial and moral responsibility. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  And if I do nothing else in this race but focus people on those two issues, I would [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=213.56s)]
*  have performed a service to my country. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  I know that my father had the pivotal effect on my life. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  Was that true for you? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=223.9s)]
*  Did your dad have an effect on the man you became? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=224.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=227.2s)]
*  My father never knew his biological father, so it's not a death sentence. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  But my father believed in hard work. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  He ended up working when he got out of the military two full-time jobs cleaning toilets, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=234.44s)]
*  Tucker. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  Started a little cafe when he was around 47 years old, ran it until his 80s. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=239.83999999999997s)]
*  When my dad died, he owned the property where the restaurant was, a little piece of property [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=243.0s)]
*  next door to it, plus a house from South Central that we still have in our own family. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=247.04s)]
*  So the man had died with a net worth of a little bit under a million dollars. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=250.76s)]
*  Not too bad for a kid from Athens, Georgia, Jim Crow South, whose mom threw him out of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=254.28s)]
*  the house at the age of 13. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=259.12s)]
*  That's what you can do in America. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=260.88s)]
*  My dad, by the way, was a lifelong Republican. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=261.96s)]
*  He said this about Democrats. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=264.16s)]
*  Democrats want to give you something for nothing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=265.96s)]
*  When you try to get something for nothing, you almost always end up getting nothing for [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=267.32s)]
*  something. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=270.52s)]
*  And my mom was a lifelong, if I said Democrat, I meant Republican. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=271.52s)]
*  My mom was a lifelong Democrat. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=274.8s)]
*  And Tucker, they would have arguments over the kitchen table, but nobody called anybody [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=276.6s)]
*  a fascist. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  Nobody said you only care about the rich. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  Can you only care about the poor? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=283.36s)]
*  They were able to debate these things civilly, and we ought to be able to do that in this [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=287.96s)]
*  Amen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=288.96s)]
*  Well, that's a really inspiring message. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=289.96s)]
*  Larry Elder, congratulations on this decision. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=293.52s)]
*  I'm glad you made the announcement here, and we'll see you again. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=295.4s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HRrI3mnas&t=298.28s)]
