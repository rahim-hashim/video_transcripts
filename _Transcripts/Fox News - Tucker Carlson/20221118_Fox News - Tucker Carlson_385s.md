# Dave Portnoy: How did people not know this?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig)
*  Dave Portnoy is a sports guy, is obviously the founder of Barstool Sports, sports media giant, online gambling giant, also an investor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us on set now to assess. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=7.76s)]
*  So that's really the question. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=9.44s)]
*  Thank you, Dave, for coming. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=10.32s)]
*  That's really the question. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=11.52s)]
*  You are, I don't know how to describe your investing, but it's something you do on the side, but you're into it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=12.52s)]
*  So you're not like a trained expert. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=17.84s)]
*  FTX was an advertiser of ours. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=19.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=21.48s)]
*  So, but you're an enthusiast. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=21.88s)]
*  What? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I mean, was this obvious to you that there's something weird going on? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=24.48s)]
*  No, I don't know how it could be obvious to anybody. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=27.0s)]
*  I mean, if you see Tom Brady pitching FTX on the Super Bowl, you're probably going to believe it's a legitimate thing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=29.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why you want it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=36.04s)]
*  As the stories have come out in crypto, you know, I'm not paying a ton of attention. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  There was articles, I think CoinDesk wrote it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=42.0s)]
*  The thing that's shocking to me, and I'm in the gambling field where rigorously regulated, like they know what I did 20 years ago. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=50.92s)]
*  Everything. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=51.6s)]
*  If I do one thing weird, I hear about it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=52.36s)]
*  There's companies writing articles. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=55.24s)]
*  We knew this guy was in the Bahamas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=58.68000000000001s)]
*  Because it's unregulated living in basically a Paul and Morris penthouse with like 20 people who were all having sex with each other running this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=59.08s)]
*  And it was well known. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=68.4s)]
*  I mean, if somebody did that in the United States and meanwhile, he's cavorting with politicians at the highest level of government. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=69.72s)]
*  The fact he wasn't investigated to me just shows what this a lot of this country is all about. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=76.72s)]
*  People just trying to make money. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  They're being dishonest. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=83.92s)]
*  They're saying the right things to make money. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=84.84s)]
*  And he's lining everybody's pockets. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=86.56s)]
*  It wasn't obvious to me. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=88.36s)]
*  But if you're meeting with Gensler and you're meeting with politicians, I don't know how in a million years they didn't know that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=89.92s)]
*  It was pretty obvious it wasn't a welcome. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=98.36s)]
*  I mean, I wasn't looking for it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=100.16s)]
*  But once you start going back, it's like, holy cow, how did they not know this? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=101.6s)]
*  Again, contrast that with like what I go through because people don't like me in his night and day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=105.68s)]
*  I mean, it really is quite stark. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=112.04s)]
*  So no, not not a normal person who is investing would ever know. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=113.88s)]
*  Steph Curry, Tom Brady. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=118.44s)]
*  It's the Miami Arena down here is FTX. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=120.16s)]
*  A normal person got taken advantage of basically. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=122.52s)]
*  Right. Where's the government? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  For example, an offshore casino, they can't advertise in the Super Bowl. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=125.92s)]
*  We can't take money from them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=130.56s)]
*  That's all illegal. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=132.24s)]
*  Why was FTX legal? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=133.32s)]
*  Why could they advertise? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=135.12s)]
*  Who's regulating that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=136.2s)]
*  That to me is where the real big problem is. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=137.4s)]
*  It's because the guy is spending millions and millions and millions of dollars to grease the right wheels. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=139.4s)]
*  It also seems like now that it's failed in the spectacular way, that failure will be used as a justification for massive regulation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=145.0s)]
*  100 percent. And you mentioned it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=154.68s)]
*  He was the guy supposedly helping craft the regulation for future crypto, which is insane. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=156.24s)]
*  You have that. Are you looking at his background at all to do that? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  It will be because what you said, money wants to control the money. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=166.12s)]
*  And if you do crypto right, I think in the long term, this will be good for Bitcoin. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=169.12s)]
*  But it's hard to control. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  So I think a lot of people, politicians, whatever, looked at this guy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=175.84s)]
*  Hey, if we partner up with him, we can make sure we have our hands in the pie and kind of control what's going on. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  Also, side note, these politicians are deleting the photos with them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=185.36s)]
*  That's like the dumbest thing I've ever seen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=189.72s)]
*  What do you think? People don't know you took a photo with them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=191.16s)]
*  You delete them. It's out there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=193.0s)]
*  I don't. You could argue. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=194.68s)]
*  How hard is it to control photos once on the Internet, Dave? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=196.32s)]
*  They're gone. I mean, nobody knows more than me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=199.12s)]
*  But that's part of it. I looked at what this guy was doing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=205.12s)]
*  It's like I can't walk down the street if I hold a girl's hand. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=207.44s)]
*  It's a story. What's Dave doing? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=210.24s)]
*  This guy's it's like an X rated movie out in the Bahamas and nobody cared. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=211.52s)]
*  It's like, what are you doing? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=216.84s)]
*  And I'm not even I don't care about judge, but nobody looked into it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  They're just looking the other way, taking pictures, taking his money. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=221.28s)]
*  He's like, you said, the number two donor for the Democrats. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=224.08s)]
*  Not one word, not one peep. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=227.16s)]
*  And to be honest, if this didn't fall apart, if the finance guy, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=229.0s)]
*  who's a savage, didn't do this rumor and probably create the run, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=232.56s)]
*  nobody would ever know he'd be the altruistic guy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=236.88s)]
*  Nobody's altruistic. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=239.56s)]
*  Nobody all the crap everybody says, whether a politician is for power, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=240.88s)]
*  money, most of the time, people want to get rich. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  And I trust the guys weirdly like me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=247.08s)]
*  It is me. I've always I want to make money. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=250.44s)]
*  I want to spend money. I want to have a great life. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=252.88s)]
*  This guy I want to make money. Give it away. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=254.44s)]
*  No, you weren't. He took a loan for himself. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=255.92s)]
*  He was paying for the penthouse through the company money. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=258.44s)]
*  He was doing whatever he wanted. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  And nobody took two seconds to look to say I talked to him, by the way, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=262.88s)]
*  when they advertise, he was always a weird guy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  Like this charm and all that stuff. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=269.76s)]
*  No way. He was the least charming guy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=271.88s)]
*  Really? I've ever spoken. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=273.84s)]
*  No, there wasn't like, oh, my God, this guy's some sort of genius. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=274.76s)]
*  Maybe he he arbitraged like that with an MIT degree to make some money. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=278.24s)]
*  But he was some charming guy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  You charm the pants off people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=285.2s)]
*  He couldn't charm anybody. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  You know how he charmed him with his wallet, money, donations. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=288.12s)]
*  And they look the other way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  There is no other explanation for that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=292.12s)]
*  I'm far more charming in a one on one sit down that he is. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=294.04s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=297.8s)]
*  I end up at the blunt end of a hit piece every two weeks. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=298.72s)]
*  That's because I'm not writing checks. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=301.88s)]
*  Do you think I mean, I guess it's unknowable, but just having watched this [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  for a while, will we ever really get to the bottom of what happened? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=307.72s)]
*  No, no. I mean, listen, they say that he had this research firm. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=311.08s)]
*  They loaned all the money. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=315.52s)]
*  And then the finance guy, CZ, Binance, whatever his name. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=316.84s)]
*  They were competitors. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=320.32s)]
*  And it's all crypto. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=321.64s)]
*  Some of its magic. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  But I don't know that we'll truly know what happened [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=324.24s)]
*  because there's a lot of big players who probably lost a lot of money. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=328.52s)]
*  I mean, the bankruptcy today, what they released is crazy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=330.96s)]
*  What they were spending money on. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=333.44s)]
*  But who knows? I never think we'll know anything. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to be some conspiracy when there's big money involved. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=336.64s)]
*  I never think I'm getting a straight shake. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  Like, I mean, honestly, how can Gensler sit down with a guy [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1EagpM9kig&t=341.64s)]
