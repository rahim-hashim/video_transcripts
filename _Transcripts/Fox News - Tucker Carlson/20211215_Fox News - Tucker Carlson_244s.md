# Dana Perino analyzes CNN list of Democrats who could replace Biden
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 15, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs)
*  Dana Prieno is co-anchor of America's Newsroom, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=0.0s)]
*  co-host of The Five and one of the best people [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=2.4s)]
*  in television. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=4.24s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=5.08s)]
*  Dana, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=5.9s)]
*  I'm not gonna ask you to respond to a lot of that script. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=7.08s)]
*  But I don't wanna put you in a position. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=9.36s)]
*  Alex, that was great. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=11.92s)]
*  Yeah, that was really good. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=13.44s)]
*  But let's stand back and consider a president [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=15.64s)]
*  who has not yet completed his first year in office. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=19.36s)]
*  And this is not an attack, merely an observation, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=22.44s)]
*  who finds the media organizations that have cheerlead [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  for him for two years suddenly talking [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=27.36s)]
*  about replacing him midstream. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=29.72s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that before. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=32.12s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=33.6s)]
*  Well, it was just last week [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=34.56s)]
*  that the White House communications team [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=35.64s)]
*  did a little dog and pony show [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  to the different media outlets [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=39.28s)]
*  and chastised them for the bad coverage [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=41.32s)]
*  that they've been getting. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  And many news outlets actually complied. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=45.12s)]
*  I remember listening to one NPR report [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=48.04s)]
*  the next morning or two, and it was about inflation [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  and build back better. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=52.56s)]
*  And I couldn't believe my ears. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=53.72s)]
*  I almost had to stop and rewind, transcribe it, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=55.6s)]
*  and read it like Alex did [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=57.68s)]
*  because it was like that good for the Biden administration. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=58.88s)]
*  But this list that CNN did, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=62.32s)]
*  the first four people that they name [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=64.8s)]
*  already ran for president and lost. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=66.84s)]
*  And what does it say about the quality of their campaigns? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=69.28s)]
*  The other thing is that the Democrats [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  were pretty much hanging by a thread [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=74.76s)]
*  until President Trump came along. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  And then they unified in their distaste for him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=78.92s)]
*  But they're trying to run that playbook again. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=83.48s)]
*  But I think maybe some Democrats and people at CNN [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=85.64s)]
*  are thinking, I don't know if that's going to work [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  the second time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=90.12s)]
*  There's two names that you didn't mention [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  that are Democrats to consider. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=93.76s)]
*  I have one disagreement with you and I have a cliffhanger. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=95.6s)]
*  Can I go through them? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=97.68s)]
*  I hope you will. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=99.0s)]
*  First one is Governor Jared Polis of Colorado. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  This is a liberal Democrat, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  but he is also somebody who has been fearless [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  in talking about COVID. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=108.0s)]
*  And this week he said, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=109.04s)]
*  That's true. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=109.88s)]
*  The pandemic, the emergency is over. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=110.72s)]
*  I'm not gonna tell people what they can wear on their face. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=112.02000000000001s)]
*  We are moving on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=114.72s)]
*  The other thing that he's done, Tucker, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=115.76s)]
*  is he's talked about eliminating the state income tax [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=117.4s)]
*  in Colorado so that that state can remain competitive. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  So that's different and fresh thinking. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=123.04s)]
*  And I think the Democrats might wanna pay attention to that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  I strongly agree with that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  I wonder though, can I just ask you to pause? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=128.76s)]
*  So his line about the COVID emergency is over. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=130.24s)]
*  He's a politician, there are political considerations [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  behind it, but that's still not what the Atlantic magazine [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=136.96s)]
*  is saying, it's still pretty brave within the context. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=139.88s)]
*  I'm wondering if Democratic voters are offended by that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=142.08s)]
*  Well, maybe a small portion of them, however, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=145.28s)]
*  if you look at what Democrats found [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=147.44s)]
*  in the exit polling in Virginia, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=149.16s)]
*  what did most of the independents vote on? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  It was the fact that they were so mad [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=154.8s)]
*  about the schools being shut down for so long, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=156.4s)]
*  that they were mad about the way [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=158.88s)]
*  that small businesses were treated [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=160.08s)]
*  and had to shut down during the pandemic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=162.36s)]
*  and the height of the pandemic [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  when the big box stores like Home Depot got to stay open. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=166.4s)]
*  And there was a deep seated anger about it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=170.24s)]
*  and it's coming out and especially people are voting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=172.84s)]
*  with their feet, taking their kids out of schools. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=174.84s)]
*  No, that's right, that's the Florida's bulging. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=176.6s)]
*  So really quick, what's the cliffhanger? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=179.16s)]
*  The cliffhanger is there's just somebody [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=180.8s)]
*  that you haven't talked about and that is, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=182.44s)]
*  sorry to say it's Hillary Clinton. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=185.2s)]
*  Let me, can I read a tweet for you? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=187.16s)]
*  It's also a tweet. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=190.56s)]
*  Yes, please. This is just today, okay? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=192.0s)]
*  She said, 2024 is a make or break point [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=193.6s)]
*  for the continuation of American democracy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=196.2s)]
*  No one who believes in the power of voters [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=198.68s)]
*  to choose their leaders and the continuance [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=200.36s)]
*  of multiracial democracy can sit this one out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=202.68s)]
*  And so could it be a rematch in 2024? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=207.0s)]
*  Can America handle it? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=211.32s)]
*  It wasn't on CNN's list, but it probably should have been. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=213.36s)]
*  Sorry, I need to take a break. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=215.72s)]
*  My brain just exploded. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=216.56s)]
*  I, you know, as dark as I am in my darkest moments, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=217.6s)]
*  I couldn't have thought of something like that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=221.12s)]
*  And you're a light and cheerful person. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=222.44s)]
*  It makes me wonder about you a little bit, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=223.72s)]
*  but I'm still glad you- But think of what Alex [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  could do with that material. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=225.96s)]
*  I mean, I just, amazing. It would be amazing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=227.08s)]
*  for cable news. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=228.56s)]
*  Dana Prada, thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=229.56s)]
*  Great to see you. Thank you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCmYWrrfUHs&t=230.56s)]
