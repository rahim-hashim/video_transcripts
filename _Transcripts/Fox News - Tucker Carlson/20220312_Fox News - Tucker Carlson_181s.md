# Illegal border crossings hit huge numbers
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo)
*  So Congress has allocated another $14 billion in U.S. tax money to secure the border of Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=0.0s)]
*  So it seemed like a good moment to check in on our southern border. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=6.96s)]
*  Foxes' Bill Mollugian has done better reporting on this question than anyone in media. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=10.32s)]
*  He joins us tonight. How's it going down there, Bill? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=14.64s)]
*  Not good, Tucker. Fiscal year 2021, we all know, set the all-time record at our southern border with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=17.44s)]
*  1.7 million encounters with illegal immigrants. But so far this year, fiscal year 2022, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=22.72s)]
*  it's already blowing those last year numbers completely out of the water. Take a look at this [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=28.4s)]
*  video given to me by a source in the Rio Grande Valley this week, which we're looking at as a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=32.0s)]
*  group of illegal immigrant runners evading after they crossed illegally in Mission, Texas. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=35.68s)]
*  Unclear if they were ever caught. Then what you're going to see here is a photo compilation of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=40.08s)]
*  different incidents on different border patrol sectors all over our southern border. Different [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=44.32s)]
*  parts, Del Rio sector, Big Bend sector, Tucson, Arizona sector, large groups of illegal immigrants [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=48.56s)]
*  being apprehended and arrested by Border Patrol. Single adults, families, and runners dressed in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=53.92s)]
*  camouflage actively trying to get away. Then we talk about the criminal elements. Take a look at [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  this mugshot right here. Del Rio sector border agents reporting yesterday, they arrested this [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=62.88s)]
*  convicted murderer from El Salvador. His victim was an eight-month-old baby. He was arrested near [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=67.52s)]
*  Brackettville, Texas. Then circling back to the huge numbers I want to talk about, a DHS source [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=73.76s)]
*  telling me that just since October 1st, just in the Rio Grande Valley sector alone, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=78.24s)]
*  Border Patrol has already encountered nearly 212,000 illegal immigrants. That is a 92% increase [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=83.28s)]
*  over the same time last year. They've encountered almost 31,000 unaccompanied minors. That's up 185% [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  and they've encountered almost 67,000 family units. That is a 206% increase. And again, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=96.32s)]
*  we're only talking about one of the nine border patrol sectors at our southern border. Then [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  let's take a look at the bigger picture nationwide. This year, as I mentioned, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=107.76s)]
*  crushing last year's numbers. In fiscal year 2021, between October and January, there were just [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  under 297,000 illegal immigrants encountered at our southern border. This fiscal year, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  between October and January, there have already been nearly 673,000 encounters with illegal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  immigrants. That's more than double last year at the same time. It's a 126% increase and we've not [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  even gotten to the busy springtime months yet. And Tucker, perhaps most concerning about all of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=135.84s)]
*  this, a very high level DHS source tells me that just since October 1st, there have already been [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  more than 220,000 known gotaways at our border. Those are people that Border Patrol maybe see on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=145.12s)]
*  cameras or sensors, but they just don't have the manpower to get to. So we're talking nearly a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=151.52s)]
*  quarter million people who have snuck past our border in just over four months. Send it back to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=156.0s)]
*  you. 14 billion for Ukraine's borders, nothing to secure ours. Good mood, Sean. I appreciate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=161.44s)]
*  your coming on tonight. Thank you. Thanks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe97suorrqo&t=166.8s)]
