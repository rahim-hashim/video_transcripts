# This is pure evil: Texas lieutenant governor
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0)
*  Lieutenant governor of Texas is one of them. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=0.0s)]
*  We're happy to be joined by him tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=1.56s)]
*  He is of course, Dan Patrick. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Lieutenant governor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=4.88s)]
*  So you are the lieutenant governor of the state [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=7.28s)]
*  in which this happened. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Tell us your thoughts. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=10.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=11.34s)]
*  Tucker, since I was elected back with Greg Abbott [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=13.44s)]
*  back in 2014, this is now the fourth major mass shooting [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=17.36s)]
*  that we've had. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=22.68s)]
*  We had Sutherland Springs, the church. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=23.52s)]
*  We had the Walmart in El Paso, Odessa. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=25.0s)]
*  And then four years ago, four years ago and one week, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=28.4s)]
*  we had the shooting at Santa Fe [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=32.4s)]
*  where we lost eight students and two teachers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  And I will tell you, Tucker, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  that I've been to a lot of funerals [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=38.12s)]
*  and a lot of services, a lot of hospitals. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=40.08s)]
*  Nothing compares to what Bill just said [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=42.44s)]
*  about the loss of a child. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=46.76s)]
*  And I think when crimes like this happen, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=48.2s)]
*  this is pure evil, that it impacts a whole nation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=50.0s)]
*  Every parent, every grandparent [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=55.44s)]
*  that has a child envisions what they would feel [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=57.96s)]
*  if it happened to them. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  This is something that goes to the core of our soul, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=62.96s)]
*  all of us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=65.64s)]
*  And I hope the president tries to unify [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=66.48s)]
*  and not divide us on this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  because we as a nation will always remember this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=70.72s)]
*  These children at this school as adults one day [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  will never forget it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=79.64s)]
*  These teachers, this community of 16,000, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=80.48s)]
*  the school system only had 4,000 students [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=82.56s)]
*  in the entire system, Tucker. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=84.78s)]
*  So these are crimes that get to the very core [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=86.36s)]
*  of who we are as people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=88.8s)]
*  And I think as people, we have to look internally. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=90.96s)]
*  And how did we get here? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=93.76s)]
*  This was an evil act. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=96.4s)]
*  There's a lot that we're gonna learn [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=98.12s)]
*  and it's gonna unfold in the days and weeks ahead [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=99.42s)]
*  about this shooter. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=101.36s)]
*  But tonight, we gotta unify in prayer. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=102.2s)]
*  We have to unify in faith. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=105.08s)]
*  We have to unify in who are we? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=106.36s)]
*  Tucker, when I grew up and most of the people watching [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  grew up and you, we didn't have these situations. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=111.88s)]
*  We didn't have mass shooters in our schools. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=114.72s)]
*  We didn't have this evil. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=116.44s)]
*  And so we really have to look at us as a people, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  as a country, because we can do a lot of things. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=119.96s)]
*  And Texas has done a lot of things [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=123.2s)]
*  after the Santa Fe shooting. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=124.64s)]
*  Obviously we have to do more. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=126.32s)]
*  We have to harden these targets so no one can get in ever [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=127.82s)]
*  except through one entrance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=131.04s)]
*  Maybe that would help. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=132.32s)]
*  Maybe that would stop someone. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=134.04s)]
*  But it's really bigger than that, Tucker. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=135.54s)]
*  We're a core society. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=138.04s)]
*  We're a society that's just at each other's throats [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=139.86s)]
*  all the time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=142.36s)]
*  And we're better than this as a nation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=143.52s)]
*  Well, so let me just ask you something. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  And I know one thing, Tucker, tonight. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  I wanna praise the teachers, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  because I guarantee you, we don't know these stories yet, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=153.12s)]
*  but all those teachers were heroic today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=155.68s)]
*  I guarantee you everyone did what they did in Santa Fe. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  They took their kids and they sheltered them in place. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=160.4s)]
*  They took them to protect their lives. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=162.84s)]
*  And teachers shouldn't have to do that in their- [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=164.68s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  I pray for these parents and these grandparents and family. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=169.08s)]
*  Anyone with kids knows the elementary school teachers [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  are the best. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=172.08s)]
*  Let me ask you about that really quickly, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=172.9s)]
*  about the prayer part of it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=174.62s)]
*  So politicians always say our prayers are with these people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=177.06s)]
*  Then you hear people push back and say, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=180.3s)]
*  prayers aren't enough, prayers don't work. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=182.22s)]
*  When you say your prayers are with the people, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=184.38s)]
*  you seem to mean it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  Tell us why you think it's important [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=187.82s)]
*  to pray in a moment like this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, first off, a Christian wasn't always, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=191.82s)]
*  but Jesus Christ is my savior, and that's hope. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=193.86s)]
*  And hope in the Bible says, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=196.82s)]
*  hope in the Bible, Tucker says, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=198.1s)]
*  and that's something that we expect that will happen. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=200.5s)]
*  And that's to be rejoined with our loved ones [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=203.54s)]
*  in heaven again. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=205.3s)]
*  So that's the hope we have. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=206.14s)]
*  But I can tell you, Tucker, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=207.26s)]
*  that what I've been through all of these funerals [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=209.18s)]
*  and services over these years, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=212.68s)]
*  the one thing I have seen is people standing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=214.82s)]
*  on the rock of their faith, and that's hard today. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=217.7s)]
*  These people who are going through this now, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=220.14s)]
*  these parents and grandparents, they have to understand, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=222.28s)]
*  we're gonna walk with them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=224.38s)]
*  Greg Abbott, myself, the legislature, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=226.22s)]
*  Republicans, Democrats, Texans, 29 million of us, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=228.06s)]
*  we're gonna walk with them. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=230.86s)]
*  But I see real faith, Tucker. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  And what do you have in the absence of faith? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=234.34s)]
*  You have no hope. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=237.14000000000001s)]
*  And I realize not everyone's a believer, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=237.98s)]
*  and I understand that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=239.7s)]
*  I'm just telling you that it's times like this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=241.1s)]
*  where you realize how strong your faith is, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=244.62s)]
*  and some people realize for the first time they need God. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=247.44s)]
*  And so I believe it, Tucker. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=250.78s)]
*  What else? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=253.46s)]
*  This was a country founded on faith, Tucker. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=254.3s)]
*  And that's why together we have to come together as a people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=256.62s)]
*  Don't politicize it, don't point fingers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=259.94s)]
*  We'll figure all this out afterwards, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=262.14s)]
*  and we'll do better, and everyone will learn from it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=263.74s)]
*  But right now we have to say, who are we as a country? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=266.62s)]
*  Who are we as a people? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=269.56s)]
*  I believe in God, I believe God will be with these families. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=270.98s)]
*  And this is a time that is just, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=274.26s)]
*  my heart breaks and everyone watching heart breaks. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=275.94s)]
*  I know it does. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPCq6YODg0&t=278.5s)]
