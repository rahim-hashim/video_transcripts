# This is how Biden agrees with Trump: Huckabee
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY)
*  Here now with reaction is former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former senior [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=0.0s)]
*  adviser to President Trump, Stephen Miller. Governor, let me start with you. Did they [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=5.04s)]
*  believe what they were saying or was it always just a cynical play, what they thought was Donald [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=9.76s)]
*  Trump's weakness they would build their campaign on, knowing we'll figure it out when we get there? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=16.8s)]
*  Pete, I think the truth is they didn't know what they were saying. That's what made it so bad. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=23.76s)]
*  Joe Biden really I think burped out a little bit of truth the other day when he didn't expect that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=29.04s)]
*  he would be doing it. When he said there's no federal solution, I don't think that's what he [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=34.08s)]
*  intended to say, but it's the truth and deep down he knew it. Interestingly, that's exactly what [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=39.44s)]
*  Donald Trump said from the beginning. He said that we have to let governors manage this crisis. He [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=44.32s)]
*  understood, he respected the 10th Amendment, Joe Biden didn't. What I find most interesting is that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=49.6s)]
*  all of the legal positions that the White House under Biden has taken have been because he has [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=55.68s)]
*  the authority to set the policy. Now he's admitted not only does he not have the authority, but he [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=62.08s)]
*  doesn't have a clue how to fix what he claimed he would have fixed long before now. I think the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=68.48s)]
*  Biden administration and all their attorneys need to go to the courts and say, forget about all that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=74.08s)]
*  stuff that we filed, just go ahead and mark it down. We had no idea what we were doing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=79.68s)]
*  Stephen, I remember the Trump administration being criticized. Effectively, the argument was, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=87.76s)]
*  well, you're passing the buck to the states so that you don't have to take responsibility [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  if things go wrong. Or was it different, Stephen, a recognition that a challenge of this magnitude, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=96.56s)]
*  the China virus, required dynamic local solutions from people who could actually make the decisions, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=102.56s)]
*  and ultimately, there's no way a federal government in Washington, D.C., could apply mandates [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=108.0s)]
*  that are effective in every place, considering New York City is a little different than rural [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=113.84s)]
*  Oklahoma. Was that part of the calculation for the Trump administration? Well, I had the privilege, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=118.24s)]
*  as you know, of working for President Trump when he launched the greatest national industrial [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=123.04s)]
*  mobilization since World War II, when this pathogen landed on our shores. When it came to core issues [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=127.92s)]
*  of civil rights and civil liberties, he respected local citizens, local governments and state [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=133.04s)]
*  governments. But when it came to putting together a national response, let's not forget, this was a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=138.4s)]
*  completely new pathogen. From scratch, President Trump brought us tests, PCRs, antigen tests, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=143.28s)]
*  rapid tests, at-home tests. He brought us a bevy of therapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=150.0s)]
*  that have proven to be remarkably effective. He brought us three vaccines from scratch, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  and he brought masks, brought us ventilators, brought us gloves, brought us medical gowns, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=160.4s)]
*  all of this, all of this from scratch. Joe Biden inherited every single one of those tools, plus [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  a year of clinical data. And what have we gotten? Record death, record cases. That is an inexcusable [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=170.96s)]
*  failure. And this statement now that he's helpless as president is nothing more than a cry for help [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=178.24s)]
*  saying that he is in over his head and has no clue what he's doing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=184.96s)]
*  Is this, Governor, the beginning of a backtrack? Is this the beginning of staring at poll numbers, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=190.16s)]
*  staring at case rates? Not that that's the right metric because it isn't, but looking at a new [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=194.88s)]
*  variant and new lockdowns that are occurring in certain places, are they saying, well, we're just, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=199.6s)]
*  it's just not working. Maybe the Trump playbook was more effective than ours. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=205.04s)]
*  Well, it was more effective. And that's one of the things that we have seen. Stephen Miller was [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=210.32s)]
*  exactly right what he said. And if you remember what President Trump did, he made available all [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=214.8s)]
*  of the resources and assets and said, if you're a governor, then ask for the help and we will send [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=220.16s)]
*  it to you, but you'll manage it. And so he sent hospital ships to New York. They never needed them [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=225.84s)]
*  or used them, but he sent them because they said they needed them. He sent ventilators there more [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=231.28s)]
*  than they needed, but he made them available. That's how it's supposed to work. The governor's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=236.24s)]
*  manage the crisis, but the federal government is an assistant to help provide resources and assets. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=242.96s)]
*  What Joe Biden came along and said was, I'm going to do it. It's going to be fixed by me. And Joe [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=248.88s)]
*  Biden got in there and found out that the people he was most critical of, people like Ron DeSantis, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  people like Greg Abbott and others, were actually managing the crisis a heck of a lot better than [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=260.8s)]
*  he was. And so I don't think that he intended to basically wave the white flag in that press event [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=265.12s)]
*  yesterday with the governors, but that's exactly what he did. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=272.8s)]
*  It sure looked like it. And Stephen, before I go to you real quick, Governor, if you're a governor [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=277.12s)]
*  right now of a free state or you take the mentality of balancing actual freedom and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=282.08s)]
*  livelihood vis-a-vis science, whatever that means by those who espouse it these days, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  what's the move of those governors now that now that effectively Biden has said there is no [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=291.92s)]
*  federal response, is there more governors can do? Well, I think they're frustrated, frustrated that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=295.92s)]
*  they've spent a year waiting on Joe Biden to give them leadership that he never gave them. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=301.92s)]
*  And of course, some of them, quite frankly, are probably very just bumfuddled because they thought [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  the whole time was that they were supposed to just wait and get orders from Washington. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  But the effective governors haven't waited. They've taken the crisis, they've managed it, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=315.44s)]
*  and their people are better off and they're more free. That's how it's supposed to work. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=320.8s)]
*  A simple reading of the Tenth Amendment would help validate that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=325.36s)]
*  Stephen, if you, it's a hypothetical, but it's worth looking into a bit. If you were in the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=330.56s)]
*  White House with Donald Trump right now, considering where we are, you know, there probably would have [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=335.44s)]
*  been a delta, probably would have been an Omicron, who knows? But this Omicron variant is much [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=339.92s)]
*  different. Thank goodness it's much less lethal. At least we know that, we believe that to be true, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=345.2s)]
*  more highly transmissible. What approach do you think a Trump administration would be taking [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  right now or a reasonable administration would be taking? Well, I have no doubt as to what President [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=355.44s)]
*  Trump would have done if he continued to occupy the Oval Office. First of all, he would have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=360.48s)]
*  continued to push new therapeutics, which would have massively cut deaths, massively cut [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  hospitalizations. Secondly, he would have never undermined confidence in the vaccine the way that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=371.76s)]
*  Joe Biden did. Thirdly, and again, going back to Governor Huckabee's point, he would have made [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=376.16s)]
*  sure states had the resources, especially testing, where Joe Biden has bungled it beyond imagination. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=380.72s)]
*  President Trump would never have used the cudgel of brutal mandates, especially on our children. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=386.0s)]
*  These toddler mask mandates are insane and depriving children of a crucial development window. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  And finally, finally, on top of all of that, he would have worked in partnership with our governors [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=397.04s)]
*  to craft local strategies that made sense, particularly with emphasis on [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=402.72s)]
*  sheltering the highest risk individuals, not a broad-based blunt approach. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. Stephen, thank you. Governor Huckabee, Stephen Miller, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=414.56s)]
*  thank you both very much tonight. Really appreciate your insight this evening. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7zLFF5jzY&t=432.72s)]
