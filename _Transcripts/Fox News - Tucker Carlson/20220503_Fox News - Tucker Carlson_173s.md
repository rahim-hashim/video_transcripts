# Why they're trying to take me down: Trump-endorsed Senate candidate
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU)
*  You don't endorse a lot of candidates on the show or get even too close to politicians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=0.0s)]
*  because honestly most of them are really disappointing. They say they're going to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=3.44s)]
*  do one thing, they do another, but occasionally you run into somebody who could actually change [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=5.84s)]
*  things and you know that person could change things because all the right people are hysterical, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=10.72s)]
*  literally hysterical, about the idea of him advancing to the United States Senate. That [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=16.64s)]
*  would be JD Vance and he's running for Senate from Ohio. The primary is tomorrow and we thought it [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=21.12s)]
*  would be nice to talk to him on the eve of that. JD Vance, thanks a lot for coming on today. Congrats [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=26.16s)]
*  on the poll numbers showing you ahead, but I still thought it'd be worth hearing you explain why you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=30.32s)]
*  want to be in the Senate, what you'd do if you get there. Well, it's under simply I'd fight for [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=35.84s)]
*  normal people because I think for so long in the Republican Party we've sent people that represented [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=42.16s)]
*  the donors or the other special interests in our country, the corporate class that's for example [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=46.8s)]
*  forcing pharmaceutical companies to give hormonal therapies to children. Those people have a voice [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  in Washington DC, but normal people don't. And if I could say Tucker, I think that what's at stake [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  in this election and this primary in particular is what kind of Republican Party will we have? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=62.64s)]
*  Will we have the old Republican Party that started stupid foreign wars, that shipped American [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=67.44s)]
*  manufacturing base to China, and that didn't actually defend America's cultural values, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=72.72s)]
*  or are we going to have a Republican Party that fights for our own voters, that protects the jobs [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=78.72s)]
*  of the American manufacturing sector, and that fights back against these stupid foreign [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=83.52s)]
*  misadventures? That's really what's on the table tomorrow. I feel confident that Ohio voters are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=89.68s)]
*  going to choose me because at the end of the day they don't want to go backwards. They want a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=94.32s)]
*  Republican Party that actually stands for Americans first. I don't even need to hear a word of your [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  pitch to know you're the guy because I know for a fact there are a lot of Republican Senators in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=103.2s)]
*  Washington who are terrified by the idea of you getting there. Are you aware of that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=108.56s)]
*  I'm certainly aware of it, Tucker. In fact, if you live in Ohio, you've seen 20 million dollars [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=114.56s)]
*  close to that of negative advertising, almost all of it focused against me. Interestingly enough, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=119.04s)]
*  the same organizations that are trying to take me down in 2022 are the same groups that try to take [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=124.64s)]
*  Trump down in 2016. It's actually the exact same pro-China, anti-American organizations. So I'm [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=130.0s)]
*  certainly aware of it, Tucker, but at the end of the day these are the fights that are worth having. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=136.64s)]
*  The people who have profited from the managed decline of this country, they're not going to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  give up their power and their money easily, but these are the fights that are ultimately [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  worth having. The fact that they're coming after me lets me know I'm doing something right, and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  hopefully the people of Ohio see that I'm doing something right as well. They can tell you're [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  sincere and they're very upset about it. This is an exciting race and we'll be watching carefully. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=156.72s)]
*  JD Vance, good luck tomorrow. Thank you. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34DOPRwzkU&t=160.0s)]
