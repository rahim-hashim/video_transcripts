# Bolsonaro: These celebrities understand nothing about Brazil
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE)
*  Well, in recent years, the left's moral voices, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=0.0s)]
*  that would be, of course, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=3.4s)]
*  Leonardo DiCaprio, people who couldn't find their way [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=5.8s)]
*  unaided to El Segundo, have discovered the Amazon Rainforest, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=8.84s)]
*  where it turns out fires sometimes break out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=12.24s)]
*  They say the Amazon Rainforest is being destroyed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=14.88s)]
*  not by clear-cutting committed by China, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=16.72s)]
*  no, criticizing China's racists, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=19.04s)]
*  but because of Bolsonaro or something? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=21.28s)]
*  Anyway, the Earth is in the balance. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=23.96s)]
*  We asked Bolsonaro about that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Is the Amazon being destroyed at the rate that we read that it is? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=29.56s)]
*  No. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=36.36s)]
*  No, that is not true. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=38.76s)]
*  Two-thirds of the Brazilian territory are currently preserved [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=41.48s)]
*  and remain pristine, just as they were back in the 1500s, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=44.44s)]
*  when this country was discovered by the Portuguese. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  The criminal acts that do happen, we will not deny that, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=51.4s)]
*  are ultimately given too much visibility [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=55.64s)]
*  because there is a huge interest in making our sovereignty [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=58.12s)]
*  over the Amazonian region a relative fact [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=61.44s)]
*  or perceived in a relative light. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=64.56s)]
*  I met with President Putin and thanked him because on two occasions, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=68.96s)]
*  when this issue was discussed with other countries, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=72.52s)]
*  he stated that the Amazon region belongs to the Brazilian people, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=75.36s)]
*  not to anyone else. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=79.56s)]
*  The Amazon region is as vast as Eastern Europe. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=81.4s)]
*  It's huge. It's wonderful. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=85.24s)]
*  It's just not possible to, you know, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  take care of every square meter in the Amazon region. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=90.08s)]
*  There is illegal deforestation, yes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=95.08s)]
*  There are fire outbreaks, yes, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=97.44s)]
*  but not at the rate that is announced out there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=99.88s)]
*  California itself always, you know, catches fire, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  and it's not given that much visibility. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  French Guiana, likewise, I mean, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=108.32s)]
*  you can't possibly set a rainforest to fire, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=110.52s)]
*  but there is illegal deforestation, yes, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=112.96s)]
*  and we are working to tackle that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  And how can we solve the issue? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=117.2s)]
*  Well, it depends on the Brazilian parliament. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=119.0s)]
*  It depends on land regularization, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=121.92s)]
*  and we need the legislation to be passed to that effect. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=124.84s)]
*  In the future, any heat focus directed by a satellite [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=128.44s)]
*  will point to the ultimate owner of that land, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=131.88s)]
*  where you seem to have a focus of fire [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=134.88s)]
*  or a fire outbreak beginning. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  You will be able to know whether it belongs [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=140.28s)]
*  to the federal administration or to a private owner [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  or to the riverside people. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes the riverside populations set fields of fire [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=147.32s)]
*  for agricultural or cropping purposes, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  and that technology will certainly help us [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=153.72s)]
*  prevent any kind of deforestation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=155.68s)]
*  I mean, the Amazon region is as vast as Eastern Europe. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=158.28s)]
*  It is not easy to take care of. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  The Yanomami Indigenous Reserve itself is as big [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  as twice the territory of the state of Rio de Janeiro, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=167.16s)]
*  which is a big state. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=171.04s)]
*  So with technology, we will certainly be able [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=173.0s)]
*  to preserve the Amazonian region. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=176.2s)]
*  We do not depend on international interest [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=178.28s)]
*  in preserving the Amazonian region. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=180.28s)]
*  It is our own interests, and we, of course, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=182.48s)]
*  want these preservation efforts to be somehow reciprocated [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=184.8s)]
*  by means of carbon credits. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=188.48s)]
*  You are opposed by most actors in Brazil [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=190.56s)]
*  and celebrities, models, TV presenters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=196.84s)]
*  We learned recently that Mark Ruffalo also doesn't like you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=200.88s)]
*  You don't seem bothered at all by this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=206.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=209.32s)]
*  Well, if I do bother or become concerned [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=212.56s)]
*  about all of the criticism I get, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=215.84s)]
*  I would not be able to work. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=218.0s)]
*  Of course, no one likes to be criticized, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=219.96s)]
*  but these are people who do not understand [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  anything about Brazil. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  I think these people have never been to the Amazon region, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=226.64s)]
*  and I would actually invite them to come to the Amazon region [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=229.44s)]
*  and overfly the region, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=231.92s)]
*  and they will see an outstanding region. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=233.8s)]
*  They will be able to overfly it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=236.16s)]
*  You will see no fire outbreak. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=237.8s)]
*  You will not see the devastated areas. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they talk about the Amazon region [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=242.6s)]
*  because it's trendy, it's a fad. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, in Europe, if someone says [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=246.92s)]
*  that the Amazon region is not being devastated, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=249.8s)]
*  they are politically doomed to fiasco. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=252.52s)]
*  So it's politically good for them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=255.16s)]
*  You know, the criticism yields power, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=257.56s)]
*  yields media visibility, yields votes, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=260.32s)]
*  and that's what celebrities feed on. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=263.64s)]
*  They're not at all familiar with the Amazon region. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=266.12s)]
*  They are not at all knowledgeable about the region [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=269.16s)]
*  and the difficulty of investing in it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=271.72s)]
*  They just criticize it because it's a fad. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=273.88s)]
*  So you don't seem that bothered [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=276.64s)]
*  by Mark Ruffalo's dislike of you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=277.56s)]
*  Have you enjoyed being president of Brazil? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=279.04s)]
*  I must admit, you know, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=283.76s)]
*  I first launched myself as a candidate. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=285.24s)]
*  Of course, I intended to become the president, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  but I was all too aware of the challenges and difficulties [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=290.04s)]
*  and the experiences we have undergone or I have undergone. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  I could never, ever had imagined what it would look like. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=297.6s)]
*  But I am comforted by the fact that the other candidate, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=301.8s)]
*  the Workers' Party candidate, Haddad, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=304.44000000000005s)]
*  if he had won, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=307.48s)]
*  Brazil would certainly be what Venezuela is today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  So that's a source of comfort to me. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=311.88s)]
*  And that encourages me to say to the population [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=313.8s)]
*  God is the one who has placed me where I am today. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=317.04s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for having us. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=320.92s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=322.68s)]
*  A message to the Americans, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  God, the homeland, family and freedom. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=325.16s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  The main reason we came to Brazil was to report on what China is doing, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  something that's being ignored on purpose in the United States. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=335.8s)]
*  China is working hard to turn the developing world into a new colony, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=339.88000000000005s)]
*  a colony of China. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=344.56s)]
*  And that's particularly true in Brazil, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=345.48s)]
*  the country with the richest natural resources in the region. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=348.04s)]
*  Brazil, a military beachhead for China? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  It's of concern. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  We asked Bolsonaro about that and what he's doing to stop it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  Next. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRwrzDriUE&t=359.88s)]
