# Tucker: This is an intimidation campaign against 'Libs of TikTok'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, last year, unbeknownst to pretty much nobody, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=3.38s)]
*  a woman in Brooklyn started a Twitter account [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  that was comprised almost solely of videos [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=8.3s)]
*  of liberals talking about themselves. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=11.34s)]
*  So the concept was very simple. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=14.1s)]
*  Find interesting tape that had already been uploaded [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=15.58s)]
*  to the internet by the people who made it [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=17.78s)]
*  and then repost that tape. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=19.82s)]
*  There was no editing of it, no special effects. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=21.34s)]
*  There was very little editorial content. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=23.34s)]
*  The idea was to let activist types describe [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=25.82s)]
*  in their own words what they believe, unfiltered. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=28.04s)]
*  The woman who created it called that account [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=32.32s)]
*  Libs of TikTok. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=34.0s)]
*  Libs of TikTok now has more followers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=36.0s)]
*  than the entire population of the state of Wyoming. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=38.0s)]
*  Libs of TikTok's audience dwarfs [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  the nightly viewership on CNN. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=42.36s)]
*  So it was quite successful by definition. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=45.4s)]
*  The question is why, and here's why. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=49.44s)]
*  It turns out that as repellent [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=51.56s)]
*  as academic lifestyle liberalism may seem to you [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  the reality of it as described by the people [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=56.82s)]
*  who actually believe this stuff is even worse [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=59.580000000000005s)]
*  than you ever imagined. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=61.82s)]
*  It's really beyond belief, both idiotic and disgusting. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=62.86s)]
*  It's like watching someone eat roadkill. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  You feel nauseous, but you can't turn away. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=68.66s)]
*  So Libs of TikTok found all kinds of tape on the internet, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  but they found a bunch of selfie-style videos [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=75.08s)]
*  from the publicly available social media accounts [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=77.42s)]
*  of teachers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=80.4s)]
*  They didn't snoop. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=81.34s)]
*  They just pulled what people had already posted. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=82.62s)]
*  Here's some of what they found. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=84.52s)]
*  Hi, my name's As and I'm a preschool teacher. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=86.72s)]
*  Recently we started wearing pronoun pins [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=89.0s)]
*  and the kids get to pick a new pronoun pin every day. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=91.16s)]
*  We have some that pick like she, her every single day [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=94.24s)]
*  and we have some that change it up. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=97.0s)]
*  So I'm a non-binary preschool teacher [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=98.48s)]
*  and my kids know I'm non-binary. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=100.9s)]
*  They know I'm not a girl or a boy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=103.08s)]
*  I use they, them pronouns in the classroom. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=104.84s)]
*  We work on it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=107.0s)]
*  Not all the kids get it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=107.84s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=108.68s)]
*  And I go by mixed gray in the classroom, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=109.6s)]
*  not miss or mister. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=111.76s)]
*  Man, y'all thought me teaching the children [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=113.14s)]
*  about me being poly was crazy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=115.86s)]
*  But not only that, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  but they also know that I'm gender fluid. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=120.58s)]
*  I'm gonna give you my explanation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  about what it means to be transgender as well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=124.86s)]
*  So when babies are born, the doctor looks at them [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=127.56s)]
*  and they make a guess about whether the baby [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=130.06s)]
*  is a boy or a girl. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=132.58s)]
*  It's as young as three and four [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=134.02s)]
*  are actually aware of their gender identity, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=135.5s)]
*  even if they don't have the language for it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=137.22s)]
*  Say that pre-K through third grade are not ready [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=138.70000000000002s)]
*  for such topics is actually internalized homophobia [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=141.32s)]
*  and transphobia. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=144.26s)]
*  So those are the people in charge of tending [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=147.5s)]
*  to your small children's minds while you're at work. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=150.18s)]
*  Now, maybe you agree with the views you just heard. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=153.26s)]
*  Maybe you think that doctors just guess [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=155.22s)]
*  at the sex of newborns. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  Maybe you don't agree. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=158.0s)]
*  It almost doesn't matter. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=159.26s)]
*  Either way, you have a right as a parent [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  to know what these people are teaching to your children. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=162.94s)]
*  And yet before Libs of TikTok, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  there was not an easy way to find out [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  what they were teaching. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=169.62s)]
*  And you can't even speak the teacher's word for it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=170.46s)]
*  Well, it turns out there are an awful lot of videos [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=172.56s)]
*  like this out there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=174.24s)]
*  Libs of TikTok found a lot of them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  Here, for example, is the scene at one private school [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=176.8s)]
*  in Washington, DC. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=179.34s)]
*  Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=189.32s)]
*  Okay, so let's say you're paying $45,000 a year [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  to send your kids to some overrated, mediocre, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=194.32s)]
*  private school in the District of Columbia. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=197.12s)]
*  You think everything's fine, you pull up Libs of TikTok, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=199.2s)]
*  and you find out what's actually happening [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  in your kid's classroom. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=203.5s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  This is journalism. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=206.72s)]
*  No news organization in America has done more [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=207.78s)]
*  to reveal the reality within American schools [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  than Libs of TikTok. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  We heard a number of their videos on the show, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=213.66s)]
*  and we are grateful for their reporting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=215.62s)]
*  It was far more straightforward than anything [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=217.5s)]
*  you're gonna find in the New York Times [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=219.22s)]
*  or the Washington Post, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=220.44s)]
*  because it wasn't accompanied by a lot of bloviating [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  that just showed you the tape and you could decide. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=223.6s)]
*  That's journalism. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=225.73999999999998s)]
*  Here's another piece of tape that Libs of TikTok unearthed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=227.14s)]
*  that amazed and horrified us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  This is a teacher screaming at a student [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=231.76s)]
*  for refusing to wear a mask. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=234.32s)]
*  You're playing, are you playing? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=236.68s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=237.64s)]
*  Otherwise I will call the police. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=238.72s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=241.12s)]
*  I hear my... [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=242.56s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=243.4s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=246.4s)]
*  Yeah, I am serious, man. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=247.24s)]
*  I have enough of it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=249.16s)]
*  I knew you were gonna take off your mask [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=251.12s)]
*  the moment I turned the corner. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=252.64s)]
*  So enjoy BIA. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=254.54s)]
*  What's that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=256.34s)]
*  That's a hidden school suspension [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=257.18s)]
*  where you have to sit in a room with the military guy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=258.5s)]
*  all day because you're a piece of... [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=261.14s)]
*  I'm gonna call the police, he screeches, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=265.97999999999996s)]
*  because the kid has the mask beneath his nose. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=267.94s)]
*  Now again, maybe you're okay with your kids [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=271.34s)]
*  being taught by emotionally incontinent, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=274.58s)]
*  not cases like that, maybe you're not, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  but you probably ought to know either way. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=278.9s)]
*  So you can see why Libs of TikTok [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=280.58s)]
*  quickly became so very popular. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=282.8s)]
*  You didn't have to wade through some long editorial [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=284.12s)]
*  to find out what was actually happening. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=286.12s)]
*  You could see the raw video, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=287.6s)]
*  and again, you could assess it for yourself. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=288.68s)]
*  Millions of parents were grateful for that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=291.84s)]
*  So was Christina Pushaw, who's the press secretary [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=293.48s)]
*  for the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=295.68s)]
*  It was partly in response to videos that she saw [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=297.8s)]
*  on Libs of TikTok that Florida ultimately banned [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=300.12s)]
*  public school teachers from lecturing kindergartners [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=303.08s)]
*  about sex, that's no law. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=305.28s)]
*  It's one of the most popular laws in the state. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=306.92s)]
*  The majority of Democrats support it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=309.08s)]
*  The majority of Democrats support it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=310.88s)]
*  So Libs of TikTok was getting results, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  as good journalism does. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=314.7s)]
*  Not bad for a Twitter feed. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=316.64s)]
*  So of course that Twitter feed had to be shut down. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=318.26s)]
*  The Biden administration and its many servants [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=320.54s)]
*  in the news media set to work. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=322.3s)]
*  The neoliberal slander machine Media Matters [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=323.82s)]
*  published four separate hit pieces on Libs of TikTok [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=326.36s)]
*  in just the past three weeks. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=329.74s)]
*  It was trafficking hate for allowing liberals [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=331.54s)]
*  to talk about themselves. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=334.14s)]
*  It was anti-gay. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=335.06s)]
*  As if the site was attacking anyone. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=338.14s)]
*  Certainly it was not attacking gays. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=340.06s)]
*  It was just playing tape of people talking about themselves [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  in their own words video that they uploaded. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=344.5s)]
*  Well, Twitter could not stand this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  They shut down the account entirely twice. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=349.14000000000004s)]
*  They suspended it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=352.18s)]
*  One of the suspensions came after a complaint [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=353.02000000000004s)]
*  from a Harvard law instructor called Alejandra Caraballo. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  Quote, my report on Libs of TikTok violating Twitter rules [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  got them suspended, he bragged. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=361.22s)]
*  Yet the woman who keeps, runs Libs of TikTok kept going. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=363.76s)]
*  So ultimately Jeff Bezos weighed in. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=368.22s)]
*  Bezos' personal newspaper, The Washington Post [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  decided to harass the family of the woman [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  who operates Libs of TikTok. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  They couldn't find her, so they went after her family. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=378.16s)]
*  The Post sent what it calls its tech columnist, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=380.44000000000005s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz to show up outside a home [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  that belongs to one of the woman's relatives. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  And then Lorenz set about trying to find the woman herself. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  She couldn't. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  She sent a direct message on Twitter [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  to someone who turned out to be not that woman [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=393.22s)]
*  and had nothing to do with the account whatsoever. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=394.86s)]
*  But because she did that, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=396.96s)]
*  we know what Taylor Lorenz was saying. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=397.94s)]
*  Here's what she said, quote, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=400.14s)]
*  you're being implicated in starting a hate campaign [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=401.78s)]
*  against LGBTQ people. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=405.9s)]
*  Right, a hate campaign. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=409.46s)]
*  So here you have Taylor Lorenz [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=411.85999999999996s)]
*  who's effectively acting as the stasi for the deep state [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  trying to intimidate a private citizen into silence. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=416.26s)]
*  And this morning she gave it her best shot. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=421.78s)]
*  The Washington Post published a piece by Lorenz [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  linking to the name, the physical address, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  and the real estate licensing information [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=429.96s)]
*  of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=432.0s)]
*  After the Post published the article, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=434.86s)]
*  the woman behind Libs of TikTok went into hiding. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=436.8s)]
*  That was, of course, the whole point of the exercise. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=439.02s)]
*  People know where she lives [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  because the Washington Post linked to it, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  so she had to leave. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=443.8s)]
*  Now Taylor Lorenz, of all people, knew this would happen. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=445.46s)]
*  She knew what she was doing when she wrote the story. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=448.68s)]
*  She was trying to shut this woman up. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=451.24s)]
*  It was just a couple of months ago, you might remember, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=454.34000000000003s)]
*  that Lorenz herself complained on television [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=456.22s)]
*  that she was being harassed [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=459.94s)]
*  and that no one under any circumstances [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=461.58000000000004s)]
*  would be allowed to show up at her home. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=463.68s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=466.22s)]
*  Trolls live everywhere. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  Can you just explain what it's like? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=469.46000000000004s)]
*  Can you draw a picture of what it is like [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  when a surge of harassment hits? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=472.74s)]
*  It's horrifying, and it's not just me either. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=474.94s)]
*  You know, they immediately dox you [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  and go after your family members. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=479.02000000000004s)]
*  They try and look up everyone who's ever, you know, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=480.82s)]
*  been associated with you, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=483.12s)]
*  and it's just completely overwhelming and terrifying. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=485.04s)]
*  Oh, they go after your family members. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  Can we put that picture back up? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=490.24s)]
*  Can you show them and do that? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=491.56s)]
*  This is Taylor Lorenz outside the family members [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=492.68s)]
*  of the woman who run Libs of TikTok the other day, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=496.24s)]
*  harassing the family members. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=500.24s)]
*  Now, the tape you just saw comes from January. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=502.56s)]
*  Then in April, just eight days ago, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz, who cannot stop talking about herself, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=508.12s)]
*  drowning in Lake Me, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=511.08000000000004s)]
*  cried on television because she'd been criticized online. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=512.9s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=516.82s)]
*  I've had to remove every single social tie. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=517.84s)]
*  I had severe PTSD from this. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=521.1s)]
*  I contemplated suicide. It got really bad. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=523.58s)]
*  You feel like any little piece of information [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=526.62s)]
*  that gets out on you will be used by the worst people [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=530.14s)]
*  on the Internet to destroy your life, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=532.8s)]
*  and it's so isolating. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=535.22s)]
*  And terrifying. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=538.42s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=539.94s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=543.18s)]
*  You're fine. You're fine. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=544.34s)]
*  It's overwhelming. It's really hard. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=545.34s)]
*  It's really hard to be from Greenwich [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=548.3s)]
*  and work for the Washington Post. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=550.26s)]
*  It's hard. No power. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=551.62s)]
*  But if you really think it's hard, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=553.22s)]
*  if you're really against that kind of behavior, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=554.86s)]
*  why are you engaging in it at scale? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=556.54s)]
*  So a few weeks later, after shooting that performance, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=559.54s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz shows up at the door, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=562.06s)]
*  and there's the picture right there, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=563.66s)]
*  of a relative of the private citizen [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=565.46s)]
*  who posts videos that Taylor Lorenz's bosses don't like, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=567.3s)]
*  and then she posts that person's identity online. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=570.4s)]
*  So this is obviously an intimidation campaign [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=574.28s)]
*  designed to shut down a highly effective Twitter feed. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=577.28s)]
*  But take one step deeper into the story [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=581.24s)]
*  and ask yourself, did Taylor Lorenz, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=583.96s)]
*  the woman you just saw crying on TV because she has PTSD, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=585.96s)]
*  did she really do the reporting here? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=588.96s)]
*  Did she really track down the personal information [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=590.72s)]
*  of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=593.52s)]
*  Please. Of course not. She couldn't. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=595.7s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz is not a reporter. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=598.5s)]
*  Apart from whining about herself on television, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=600.1800000000001s)]
*  she has no skills. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=602.4200000000001s)]
*  She couldn't do a weather forecast in a rainstorm. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=603.62s)]
*  She's not a journalist. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=606.26s)]
*  She's merely a receptacle for information [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=608.1800000000001s)]
*  that other people gather for their own ends. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=611.3000000000001s)]
*  A willing receptacle. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=613.34s)]
*  So where did she get this information? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=614.7800000000001s)]
*  Who gave her the identity [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=616.82s)]
*  of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=618.62s)]
*  Well, actually, we don't have to guess [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=620.46s)]
*  because today's Washington Post story answers that question. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=621.62s)]
*  The post piece tells us that information [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=624.22s)]
*  came from a man called Travis Brown. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=626.42s)]
*  Travis Brown runs the, quote, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=628.66s)]
*  Travis Brown hate speech tracker, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=630.06s)]
*  which uses a variety of proprietary methods [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=632.54s)]
*  to reveal personally identifying information [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=634.38s)]
*  of private citizens who stray from the approved storyline. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=636.92s)]
*  Now who pays for all this? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=640.62s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=642.02s)]
*  Well, the Travis Brown hate speech tracker [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=643.66s)]
*  is funded by something called the Prototype Fund. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=645.78s)]
*  Here's how the Prototype Fund [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  describes the point of Travis Brown's project. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=649.9s)]
*  Quote, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=652.14s)]
*  In other words, before it can be censored. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=656.66s)]
*  Archiving is an important element [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=657.8199999999999s)]
*  in counteracting this behavior [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=659.4599999999999s)]
*  and has in many cases led to prominent victories [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=661.1s)]
*  in the fight against the Supreme, extreme right. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=663.66s)]
*  Extreme right. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=667.9s)]
*  So not all hate speech is the same. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=668.74s)]
*  The hate speech tracker does not target [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=671.5799999999999s)]
*  the hate speech of BLM rioters or Antifa. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=673.22s)]
*  No, only enemies of the Biden administration [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=675.5799999999999s)]
*  and the Biden administration. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=679.14s)]
*  So the Prototype Fund is a very important tool [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=680.62s)]
*  to help the people of the country [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=682.8199999999999s)]
*  and the enemies of the Biden administration [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=684.24s)]
*  and the guys at Davos. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=686.4s)]
*  How do they do it? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=688.28s)]
*  Well, Brown's methods, according to him, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=689.12s)]
*  included using automated software [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=690.58s)]
*  to save user account names and social media posts [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  long after they have been deleted. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=695.02s)]
*  So there's no hiding from these people. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=696.44s)]
*  Now that appears to be a violation [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=698.24s)]
*  of Twitter's terms of service. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=699.72s)]
*  Not that we care because they don't care. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=701.64s)]
*  We shout to Twitter about this. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=703.52s)]
*  Isn't this a violation? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=704.96s)]
*  They ignored us. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  They suspended our account. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=707.74s)]
*  What's interesting though is that Travis Brown himself [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=710.2s)]
*  appears to be a former Twitter employee. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=712.26s)]
*  So again, who's paying for this? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=715.1s)]
*  Well, a foreign government is paying for it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  The Prototype Fund gets its money, not from private donors, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=721.1800000000001s)]
*  but from the government of Germany, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=723.9s)]
*  Germany's federal ministry of education. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=726.62s)]
*  It says so right on the website. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=729.2s)]
*  In other words, what happened to the woman [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=731.7s)]
*  who runs Libs of TikTok, her life being destroyed, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=733.9s)]
*  was not the work of Taylor Lorenz, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=736.82s)]
*  the fearless journalist who cries on TV from a PTSD. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=738.7s)]
*  It was a foreign intelligence operation [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=742.04s)]
*  designed to silence and intimidate an American citizen. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=744.92s)]
*  Wait, is that legal? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=748.92s)]
*  Did the Biden administration have any role [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=750.92s)]
*  in this particular intel op? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=753.28s)]
*  Why is the German government trying to shut down [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=755.72s)]
*  an American Twitter account posting about American teachers? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=758.6s)]
*  And since she was the recipient, the willing recipient [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=762.56s)]
*  of this information from a foreign government [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=765.2s)]
*  designed to destroy an American citizen, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=767.3199999999999s)]
*  why hasn't Taylor Lorenz at the very least [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=769.34s)]
*  registered under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, FERA? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=771.6600000000001s)]
*  We seem to remember quite a bit of talk about this [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=775.0600000000001s)]
*  over the last few years. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=776.9000000000001s)]
*  We think there was an impeachment trial over it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=777.74s)]
*  Someone went to prison because of it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=779.22s)]
*  But Taylor Lorenz can take information [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=781.62s)]
*  from a foreign government to crush an American citizen, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=783.98s)]
*  clearly as part of an intel operation, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=787.0200000000001s)]
*  and she's a journalist in good standing [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=789.4200000000001s)]
*  at the Jeff Bezos' newspaper? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=791.1800000000001s)]
*  Lots of questions here. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=794.72s)]
*  We hope we can get to the bottom of all of them. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nMlMU48wI&t=795.6600000000001s)]
