# Tucker Carlson: Huge immigration crisis 'making up the difference' of American fertility decline
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o)
*  Stephen Miller does not support it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=0.0s)]
*  He worked in the Trump White House for four years [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=2.0s)]
*  where he worked very hard to stop this [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=4.0s)]
*  in the end unsuccessfully. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=6.0s)]
*  But he is still fighting. He's the founder of America First Legal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=8.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. Stephen Miller, thanks so much [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=10.0s)]
*  for coming on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=12.0s)]
*  So it's hilarious if you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=14.0s)]
*  think about the amount of energy [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=16.0s)]
*  they spend shouting at anyone who notices [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=18.0s)]
*  the numbers. The great replacement theory, that's racist! [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=20.0s)]
*  Again, I would argue race has nothing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=22.0s)]
*  to do with this. The numbers [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=24.0s)]
*  tell a very clear story. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=26.0s)]
*  Americans are not replacing themselves [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=28.0s)]
*  naturally by having [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=30.0s)]
*  children in a country that's increasingly [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=32.0s)]
*  hostile to children and immigration is making up [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=34.0s)]
*  the difference. Why don't we have a right to be mad about that? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=36.0s)]
*  Well, I think first a bit of history [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=38.0s)]
*  is in order here. What many [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=40.0s)]
*  Americans may not realize is that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=42.0s)]
*  during the period of time when the great [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=44.0s)]
*  American middle class was born, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=46.0s)]
*  during the Eisenhower era, when we [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=48.0s)]
*  had rapid middle class growth, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=50.0s)]
*  rapid increase in our quality of living, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=52.0s)]
*  rapid increase in our wages, and when [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=54.0s)]
*  immigrant and US born Americans [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=56.0s)]
*  alike saw a huge increase [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=58.0s)]
*  in their living standards, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=60.0s)]
*  there was net negative [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=62.0s)]
*  immigration into this country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=64.0s)]
*  In other words, the number of immigrants leaving [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=66.0s)]
*  was greater than the number of immigrants coming [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=68.0s)]
*  every single year to the point where [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=70.0s)]
*  we had 14 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=72.0s)]
*  million immigrants in 1920. By 1965, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=74.0s)]
*  we had fewer than 10 [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=76.0s)]
*  million immigrants. During that same time [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=78.0s)]
*  period, our population doubled [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=80.0s)]
*  from American families having [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=82.0s)]
*  kids. Now since 1965, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=84.0s)]
*  the Ted Kennedy rewrite [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=86.0s)]
*  and Joe Biden's open borders, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=88.0s)]
*  the vast majority of our population [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=90.0s)]
*  growth is solely people coming [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=92.0s)]
*  here from foreign countries. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=94.0s)]
*  And as you mentioned, you cannot have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=96.0s)]
*  social cohesion that way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=98.0s)]
*  Los Angeles is more than one third foreign born. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=100.0s)]
*  New York City is more than one third foreign born. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=102.0s)]
*  San Francisco is more than one third [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=104.0s)]
*  foreign born. One in four kids, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=106.0s)]
*  this is amazing, in the whole country, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=108.0s)]
*  one in four kids in the whole country, has a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=110.0s)]
*  foreign born parent. It is not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=112.0s)]
*  in their interest or ours [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=114.0s)]
*  to keep adding more and more [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=116.0s)]
*  and more and more immigrants so there [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=118.0s)]
*  can't be any cohesion. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=120.0s)]
*  There cannot be social trust. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=122.0s)]
*  There cannot be civic bonding. There cannot [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=124.0s)]
*  be a shared culture, a shared language, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=126.0s)]
*  a shared education, a shared experience, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=128.0s)]
*  and a shared pathway to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=130.0s)]
*  success. We are eroding and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=132.0s)]
*  destroying all of these things [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=134.0s)]
*  by unending migration. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=136.0s)]
*  What's so scary is nobody cares about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=138.0s)]
*  social cohesion until the crisis hits, until [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=140.0s)]
*  say the economy tanks, and there's just not [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=142.0s)]
*  enough to go around, at which point it becomes [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=144.0s)]
*  the thing that stands between you [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=146.0s)]
*  and actual chaos. Are they not thinking this through? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=148.0s)]
*  Trust is all you have. That's exactly right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=150.0s)]
*  In that situation, trust is all you have. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=152.0s)]
*  If there's an attack and we [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=154.0s)]
*  lose our power, we lose our water, we lose [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=156.0s)]
*  our infrastructure, we lose our electricity, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=158.0s)]
*  what keeps us [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=160.0s)]
*  from riots and looting and from [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=162.0s)]
*  madness? It's trust. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=164.0s)]
*  It's the ability to know that the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=166.0s)]
*  people that you are living in the community with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=168.0s)]
*  will take care of each other and protect each other. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=170.0s)]
*  And uncontrolled migration [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=172.0s)]
*  makes this a nation of strangers. So again, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=174.0s)]
*  I don't care where you're born. No matter [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=176.0s)]
*  where you're from, if you're living here today, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=178.0s)]
*  it's in your interest [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=180.0s)]
*  to turn off the spigot tomorrow. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=182.0s)]
*  I think that's a really smart point. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=184.0s)]
*  And you're seeing a lot of people, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=186.0s)]
*  immigrants even, arriving in that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=188.0s)]
*  same conclusion. Exactly. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=190.0s)]
*  Stephen Miller, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=192.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=194.0s)]
*  We're going to be back with another [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=198.0s)]
*  story of the nightly [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=200.0s)]
*  channel to catch our nightly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=202.0s)]
*  opens, stories that are changing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=204.0s)]
*  the world and changing your life. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=206.0s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSg6q4hVr5o&t=208.0s)]
