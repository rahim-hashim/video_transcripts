**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw)
*  So a lot of people claim that professional wrestling is fake. Well, how fake is it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=0.0s)]
*  We thought we would talk to an actual professional wrestler. In fact, one of the most famous [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=4.2s)]
*  Hacksaw Jim Duggan and he respectfully respectfully disagrees. We talked to him for a brand new episode of Tucker Carlson today [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=8.24s)]
*  Here's part of it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=14.64s)]
*  Back then do you think it's fake you come up in the ring with you and we'll show him it's fake or not [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=20.88s)]
*  So he had a fight every local tough guy there is you know, and of course, that's the old joke [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=25.64s)]
*  You're always a phony wrestler [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=30.32s)]
*  Until you go to court [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=32.56s)]
*  You go to court your it's his train killer goes like that 10 20 30 thousand every time he hit him that lawsuit goes up [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=35.64s)]
*  You know, they're like I'm gonna sue you said I'm getting my money's worth. We're not done brother [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=42.88s)]
*  So what were the guys so this was even though it was in the 70s it wasn't in the 20s [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=48.8s)]
*  Was really a different time right much different business was a really rough tough carnival type business [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=54.04s)]
*  Yeah back then people were marks you try to work them out of their money now with sports entertainment international [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=60.14s)]
*  What does that mean? They were marks you try to work them out. Well, yeah like a carnival type term [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=65.84s)]
*  You know people you're trying to work them out of their money [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=69.64s)]
*  Get them to give the year the money somehow trying to work them out of their money. That's was never my idea [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=71.84s)]
*  I said I put out a performance those folks pay to come watch me perform. Were you on the road and always on the road? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=77.6s)]
*  Yeah, an awful lot. That's one of the hard things about wrestling is the road, you know, especially back then in the old WWF [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=83.2s)]
*  Which was the golden age of wrestling Hulk Hogan Jake the snake Roberts macho man Andre the giant [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgta5pBHJOw&t=89.5s)]
