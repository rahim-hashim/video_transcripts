# DeSantis responds to outrage over his ask for kids to unmask
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY)
*  With the midterm elections approaching, suddenly everyone's admitting that surgical masks actually [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=0.0s)]
*  don't stop the coronavirus. If they did, maybe close to a million Americans wouldn't have [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=6.12s)]
*  died from it. Even Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi have stopped pretending, but some schools [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=10.32s)]
*  haven't gotten the memo they're still forcing kids to wear masks. No excuse. On Wednesday, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was in Tampa for a press conference at the University of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=21.32s)]
*  South Florida. As he came to the podium, he saw several students wearing masks. Here's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=24.6s)]
*  what he said. You do not have to wear those masks. I mean, please take them off. Honestly, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=28.6s)]
*  it's not doing anything. We got to stop with this COVID theater. So you want to wear it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=33.6s)]
*  All right. But this is ridiculous. Well, it is ridiculous. And if no one else is going [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  to tell him, probably good. He told them it's not good to lie to kids. At best, it makes [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  them grow up to be liars. And of course, as you may have noticed, that enraged the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=53.04s)]
*  media. They were totally infuriated by this because it refuted the lies that they have [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=59.96s)]
*  told for years about children being forced to wear masks. So here's how they reacted [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=64.0s)]
*  to what DeSantis said. Republican governor of Florida today, Ron DeSantis, berating high [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=68.36s)]
*  school kids for wearing masks at his indoor news conference. Wow. Where was that guy? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=74.88s)]
*  So mean. I mean, serious. No, I'm serious. Was that guy raised in a barn? Seriously, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=80.76s)]
*  this is a question I asked. Who raised him? This is the governor of your state and it's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  televised. Like you're on video. It's going to go everywhere. These kids are at an age [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  where people already tease and bully. And like, now you just, you saw that girl like [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=97.56s)]
*  scrambling to take hers off. Like, what do I do? I just found to say that to a bunch [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=101.4s)]
*  of minors. One kid looked at him like, shut up. Yeah, I like that kid. There was some [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=105.64s)]
*  kids that did not take off their masks. And I thought that's damn good parenting right [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=110.64s)]
*  there. Oh, they're such liars. They'll say anything. And if they think you're gaining [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=114.52s)]
*  momentum, they want to crush you. So just to be clear, telling kids they don't actually [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=118.68s)]
*  have to wear masks because masks don't work is bullying, but threatening to throw them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=123.52s)]
*  out of school and destroy their lives. If they don't wear a mask, science. We want to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=128.16s)]
*  straighten this out with the governor of Florida himself. We are honored to be joined by Ron [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=133.16s)]
*  DeSantis. Governor, thanks for coming on. So why did you say that? Good evening. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=136.52s)]
*  Well, Tucker, none of the adults were wearing masks. And it seemed to me that someone told [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  those kids they had to do it. So I just wanted to make it very clear. They do not need to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=147.24s)]
*  be doing it. Obviously, in Florida, it's a free state. You can do it. But I think it's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  also important to point out that there's no reason to do it for young and healthy kids, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=155.96s)]
*  especially in the state of Florida. We never had a mask mandate, of course. But our [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=161.08s)]
*  guidance from our health department is not to wear these cloth masks. And I think it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=166.24s)]
*  needs to be said because people have been lied to for two years. And so I was I didn't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=171.4s)]
*  want it to be thinking that like they were told to do this by me, because I certainly [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=177.24s)]
*  wouldn't do that. And they talk about, oh, by letting someone have a choice to take off [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  their mask and welcoming that choice, that that's somehow bullying. Tucker, bullying [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  is locking kids out of school, which they did. Bullying is forcing kids to wear masks [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=190.92s)]
*  for eight hours a day, which they did for two years and are only stopping now because [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=196.16s)]
*  the polling's change. Bullying is kicking people out of work because of vaccine mandates. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=199.92s)]
*  We fought all of those policies in Florida. We lifted people up and we liberated them [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=205.32s)]
*  from local school boards and governments that imposed them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=210.72s)]
*  It's a little weird to hear criticism from people who are unmasked sitting in crowded [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=214.0s)]
*  studios saying that you're immoral for telling kids who are at a lower risk than the adults [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=219.2s)]
*  who are unmasked in those studios not to wear masks. Like what people can see themselves, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  I guess. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, and it creates a two tier society. You have adults that are not mass, right? And [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=230.56s)]
*  then the students are all mask or you'll have a crowded restaurant where everyone's having [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  a good time and they make the servers wear masks. I reject the two tier society. I say [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=239.2s)]
*  every time we go, if we're at a big event and the servers are wearing it, they should [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=245.46s)]
*  be liberated from those masks. It is political theater. They're doing it for the appearance. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=249.94s)]
*  They're not doing it because it's having any meaningful medical impact. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=256.22s)]
*  No, but everyone loves a caste system, especially when they're at the top of it, right? I mean, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=259.66s)]
*  that's really what they're demanding. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=264.02s)]
*  Exactly. And we've seen time and time again, all these left wing lockdown politicians, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=265.02s)]
*  they'll impose mandates on others, then they'll be out cavorting. And by the way, they escaped [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=272.46s)]
*  to Florida and live under our freedom time and time again. And we've documented that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=277.18s)]
*  as well. So it is a hierarchy and that's what they're trying to impose. And we reject that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=281.29999999999995s)]
*  in Florida. And yes, if I have people that I think are being bullied into doing masks, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to let them know you have the right to take it off. And I'm also going to tell [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  them the truth, which not a lot of adults have told them, that it's not effective to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  wear them in the first place. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=299.7s)]
*  Amen. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=301.26s)]
*  You're a face servant. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=302.26s)]
*  That's exactly right. Governor Ron DeSantis of the Free State of Florida. Great to see [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=303.26s)]
*  you tonight. Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MoDXvkJtY&t=306.46s)]
