# Tucker: You are not allowed to ask this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, as if this country's core institutions [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=2.4s)]
*  have not been degraded or diminished enough [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=4.24s)]
*  with pregnant flight suits and FBI [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=6.88s)]
*  that behaves like Nancy Pelosi's Praetorian Guard, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=8.48s)]
*  as if that weren't bad enough, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=10.32s)]
*  Joe Biden announced in January his plan [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=12.16s)]
*  to choose the next Supreme Court justice [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=14.16s)]
*  on the basis of appearance. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  The Supreme Court, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=17.6s)]
*  you never thought that would happen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=19.12s)]
*  Sociology department may be, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  your company perhaps, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=22.56s)]
*  but the Supreme Court really matters. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=24.72s)]
*  What does appearance have to do with ability [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=27.68s)]
*  or fealty to the Constitution? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=30.56s)]
*  Joe Biden never explained. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=32.32s)]
*  He did indicate, to be fair, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=34.08s)]
*  that he would prefer a lawyer for the job, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=35.2s)]
*  maybe even a clever one, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=36.56s)]
*  but mostly he said he wanted a black woman, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=37.68s)]
*  genetics being the single most important factor [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=40.4s)]
*  in what we used to call judicial temperament. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=42.48s)]
*  How does that work exactly? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  How do genes determine your ability [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=46.64s)]
*  as a Supreme Court justice [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=48.96s)]
*  or a surgeon or an airline pilot or anything else? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  We would love to hear Joe Biden explain that, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=53.2s)]
*  but he didn't. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=54.72s)]
*  Instead, he embarked on a predictably short [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=56.24s)]
*  nationwide search for such a candidate [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  and located in the end a person called [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=60.08s)]
*  Kentucky Brown Jackson. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=61.84s)]
*  Her confirmation hearings continue today [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=63.2s)]
*  for the second day. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=64.88s)]
*  Not surprisingly, given how she got this job, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=66.08s)]
*  most of the talk in Washington [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=68.16s)]
*  was not about what she's done, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=69.44s)]
*  how she thinks, what she's like as a person, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=71.36s)]
*  but instead about how she looks. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=73.6s)]
*  It's not shallow or anything. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  Here's the shallowest of all, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=77.92s)]
*  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=79.04s)]
*  I could not stop being just joyous [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=81.36s)]
*  that you were sitting in my office [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=83.28s)]
*  and I couldn't stop bringing up to you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=85.12s)]
*  the historical nature of this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=86.64s)]
*  Forgive me, I grew up in a small black church [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=88.48s)]
*  where I was taught to make a joyous noise [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  unto the Lord. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=93.04s)]
*  And this is not a normal day for America. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  We have never had this moment before. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=97.04s)]
*  I grew up in a small black church, Nathan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=101.68s)]
*  Another lecture about the black experience [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=104.72s)]
*  from a blue-eyed Yale graduate [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=106.48s)]
*  who in fact grew up in an all-white town, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=107.92s)]
*  the son of IBM executives. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  Is there anyone on this planet [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  phonier than Cory Booker? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=113.44s)]
*  To her credit, Kandaji Brown Jackson [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=115.76s)]
*  doesn't seem quite so fraudulent. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=117.36s)]
*  That would be impossible. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=118.72s)]
*  But she does, and this is the key, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  share a resume that is strikingly similar [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=121.84s)]
*  to Cory Booker's. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=123.84s)]
*  Daughter of academics, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  on the board of the single wokest day school [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., etc., etc. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  You know exactly how that story turns out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=132.4s)]
*  Because in the end, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=135.6s)]
*  when they tell you you're getting a black nominee, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=136.56s)]
*  they're not talking about the son of a maid [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=139.12s)]
*  and a farm worker from Pinpoint, Georgia. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  In fact, we already have a Supreme Court justice like that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=143.36s)]
*  His name is Clarence Thomas. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=145.68s)]
*  He is a great man, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  even if no one in Washington will acknowledge that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  No, what they mean when they tell you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  you're getting a black Supreme Court justice [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=151.52s)]
*  is that you're getting yet another Democratic Party robot [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=153.68s)]
*  with the same rigid and totally predictable views [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=156.56s)]
*  as your average professional class white liberal, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=159.28s)]
*  but who happens to be tanner than Joe Biden. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=162.56s)]
*  So identical, identical to everyone else in power, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=165.28000000000003s)]
*  just a different shade. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=169.44000000000003s)]
*  And the shade, to be fair, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  does make all the difference. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=172.08s)]
*  That's the whole point of the exercise. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=173.28s)]
*  Because of the way that she looks, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=175.12s)]
*  Brown Jackson, who again, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=176.56s)]
*  is just a garden variety white liberal [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  in what she believes, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  but because of the way she looks, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  this nominee will get nowhere near the vetting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=184.4s)]
*  of a typical Supreme Court justice. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  And that, whatever your politics are, is a shame. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=188.24s)]
*  As Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  put it four years ago when Democrats [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=193.36s)]
*  were baselessly accusing a Republican nominee of rape, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=194.8s)]
*  quote, when a Supreme Court seat is on the line, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=197.12s)]
*  the court and the country deserve the benefit of the doubt, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=199.92s)]
*  not the nominee. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=202.16s)]
*  All right, we're kind of on board with that actually, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=204.16s)]
*  but that was yesterday's standard. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Today, not surprisingly, that same newspaper, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  Jeff Bezos' personal newspaper, announced a new position. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  Post put it this way in a headline, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  how low will the GOP go in ticking on Kentucky Brown Jackson? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  Pretty funny. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=221.2s)]
*  It's low to ask questions of a Supreme Court nominee. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=222.48s)]
*  But we're not deterred. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=226.56s)]
*  We believe in standards on this show. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=227.44s)]
*  The Supreme Court, of course, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=228.72s)]
*  one of the most powerful institutions in the world. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=229.44s)]
*  Joe Biden did not create the Supreme Court. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=232.4s)]
*  Previous generations did. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=234.8s)]
*  Hundreds of years ago, he does not own it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=236.0s)]
*  He merely inherited it for a short time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=237.52s)]
*  And so the rest of us have an interest in who sits on it [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=239.84s)]
*  and who interprets our Constitution. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=242.72s)]
*  Joe Biden, sounding maybe a touch defensive, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=244.96s)]
*  has described Kentucky Brown Jackson [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=247.28s)]
*  as one of this country's great legal minds. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=248.96s)]
*  And we certainly want to believe that for real, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=250.72s)]
*  given that she's probably going to be confirmed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=253.84s)]
*  no matter what we think. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=255.2s)]
*  The question is, is it true? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=256.4s)]
*  Is she really one of this country's great legal minds? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=258.32s)]
*  One way to know, one indication would be her LSAT scores. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=261.2s)]
*  The LSAT is not a knowledge test. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=265.12s)]
*  It measures logic and reasoning ability. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=267.36s)]
*  And no one doubts it's an accurate measure of those things, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  which predicts legal skills. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=272.8s)]
*  And that's why top law firms, law schools, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=274.48s)]
*  have long used that test. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=277.04s)]
*  So how did Kentucky Brown Jackson do on the LSAT? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=280.0s)]
*  Sorry, you're not allowed to ask, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=282.8s)]
*  because asking is racism. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=285.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=287.68s)]
*  After Judge Jackson's name was announced, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=288.88s)]
*  So is Kentucky Brown Jackson? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, on his Fox News program, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=293.76s)]
*  ignored her nearly nine years on the federal bench [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=296.96s)]
*  and instead wondered about her scores on the LSAT. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=300.4s)]
*  You do not hear substantive legal arguments [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=304.08s)]
*  about her actual decision-making process [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=306.96s)]
*  coming from these people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=309.2s)]
*  All they've got is the racism. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=310.4s)]
*  They want to go about the LSAT scores. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=311.68s)]
*  I'm not going to curse because it's Sunday and I'd get fired. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=313.76s)]
*  But can you talk about why what Tucker Carlson just said [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=317.2s)]
*  is so repugnant? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=321.44s)]
*  And they have implied you were solely nominated [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=324.08s)]
*  due to your race and not for other factors. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  Apparently, some have even claimed that you need to show [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=330.24s)]
*  your LSAT scores to determine whether you are a top legal mind. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  This is incredibly offensive and condescending. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=340.24s)]
*  Hehehe. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=344.0s)]
*  It's repugnant! [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=345.2s)]
*  It's incredibly offensive! [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=346.32s)]
*  She's a top legal mind! [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=348.4s)]
*  Shut up! [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=349.76s)]
*  We don't have to show you proof. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=351.2s)]
*  You're not allowed to ask for proof. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=352.64s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=354.88s)]
*  So here you've got Maisie Gerono, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=355.52s)]
*  the Senate's dumbest member. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  We don't need to ask for her test scores. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  We know what they are. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=360.08s)]
*  She's infuriated that anyone would suggest [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=361.44s)]
*  that Judge Jackson was nominated because of her race and sex [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=364.4s)]
*  after Joe Biden bragged repeatedly [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  that Judge Jackson was nominated for her race and sex. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=370.08s)]
*  It's too funny. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  They demand that you listen to them very carefully, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=375.44s)]
*  but they become apoplectic if you dare to repeat what they say. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=377.68s)]
*  What's the message here? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=381.28s)]
*  Shut up! [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=382.08s)]
*  You're not allowed to talk! [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=382.64s)]
*  No more insolent surf! [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  Sorry, not playing along. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  Thankfully, in the hearings today, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  a few senators did manage to ask relevant questions. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  Here's Josh Hawley. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  United States versus Hawkins. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=394.96s)]
*  This was a child pornography case [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=396.88s)]
*  where the defendant distributed multiple images of child porn, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=398.64s)]
*  possessed dozens more, including videos. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=401.84s)]
*  The federal sentencing guidelines recommended [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=404.56s)]
*  a sentence of 97 to 121 months in prison. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=406.88s)]
*  Prosecutors recommended 24 months in prison. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=410.96s)]
*  Judge Jackson gave the defendant three months in prison. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=414.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, that's pretty serious. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=420.4s)]
*  Why did you do that, Judge Jackson? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=422.08s)]
*  Well, here was the response. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=424.79999999999995s)]
*  The guideline was based originally on a statutory scheme [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=426.8s)]
*  and on directives, specific directives by Congress, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=431.92s)]
*  at a time in which more serious child pornography offenders [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=435.36s)]
*  were identified based on the volume, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=442.96s)]
*  based on the number of photographs that they received in the mail. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=447.04s)]
*  And that made total sense before, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=450.88s)]
*  when we didn't have the internet, when we didn't have distribution. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=454.4s)]
*  But the way that the guideline is now structured, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=457.36s)]
*  based on that set of circumstances, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=460.96s)]
*  is leading to extreme disparities in the system [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=463.76s)]
*  because it's so easy for people to get [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=467.52s)]
*  volumes of this kind of material now by computers. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=472.24s)]
*  Now, we'll just concede up front, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=478.0s)]
*  we are not world-renowned legal minds, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  or even technically lawyers on this show. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=482.16s)]
*  But we're going to try to understand what the judge just said. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  So Congress passed a law saying possessing a lot of kiddie porn [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=488.8s)]
*  is a very serious crime. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=492.24s)]
*  And then an invention, the internet, comes along [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=493.6s)]
*  and makes it easier to collect a lot more kiddie porn. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  So according to noted legal mind, Kentucky Brown Jackson, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  that somehow makes the act of possessing a lot of kiddie porn less bad. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  In other words, since the internet makes it simple, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=506.24s)]
*  we're not going to punish you as much. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=508.56s)]
*  Maybe we're misinterpreting what she said. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=512.24s)]
*  That seems to be what she said. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=513.6s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  If not, it helps to understand in the clip you just saw [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=516.48s)]
*  that Judge Brown was not articulating some legal principle [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=519.36s)]
*  related to the Constitution that we could generalize across our code. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=522.16s)]
*  She was instead constructing a carve-out [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=526.0s)]
*  for a narrow and specific group of criminals, sex offenders. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=528.08s)]
*  And it's not the first time. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  It's one of many such carve-outs she has argued for during her career. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  In 1996, for example, Kentucky Brown Jackson argued [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=538.24s)]
*  in the Harvard Law Review against sex offender registry laws. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=541.52s)]
*  Here was her reasoning. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  Why is it unconstitutional? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  She didn't explain. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  Is that a sound legal argument? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=566.88s)]
*  And why is Judge Jackson so fixated on defending sexual predators? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=569.84s)]
*  What does the FBI think of that? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=575.2s)]
*  Well, funny you asked about the FBI. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  This show has just obtained an email from the FBI's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles Women in Black Affairs Committee. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=582.1600000000001s)]
*  That's some group within the FBI you're seeing on your screen right now. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=584.4000000000001s)]
*  This was sent out to every FBI agent in the FBI's LA field office on March 11th, this month. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=587.76s)]
*  It is an invitation to quote a nomination party for Kentucky Brown Jackson. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=594.32s)]
*  Join us for quote lots of celebrating, the invitation reads. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=599.76s)]
*  Now the party was set for March 23rd. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=603.84s)]
*  That's tomorrow in an FBI conference room. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=606.16s)]
*  Kristi Coons-Johnson, the assistant director in charge of the LA field office, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=609.76s)]
*  is the featured speaker. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=613.28s)]
*  This is a nominee. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=616.24s)]
*  This is someone who doesn't have the job, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=619.12s)]
*  whose nomination is by definition a political question. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  The Senate votes on it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=624.64s)]
*  That's in the Constitution, by the way. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  And the FBI is weighing in with both feet on their choice, which is Kentucky Brown Jackson. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=628.48s)]
*  So we should tell you the next day, the FBI's Diversity and Inclusion Office issued what it [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=634.8000000000001s)]
*  called an update. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=638.72s)]
*  Quote, the FBI must remain neutral in all political nomination and confirmation processes. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=640.32s)]
*  Accordingly, a party for any nominee in FBI space would be inappropriate. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=645.52s)]
*  We apologize for any misunderstanding surrounding the publicity for this event. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=649.84s)]
*  Misunderstanding surrounding the publicity. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=653.52s)]
*  Not that we did it, but that you somehow misunderstood the publicity. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=654.96s)]
*  No, there was no publicity. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=659.36s)]
*  We just read the invitation. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=660.4s)]
*  The update included a new flyer for the same party that removed any mention of Brown Jackson. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not a misunderstanding. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkS_4bIr98&t=668.32s)]
