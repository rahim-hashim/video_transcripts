# Rep Lee Zeldin reacts to new polling showing him leading incumbent Gov Kathy Hochul
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI)
*  Living in New York now is dangerous. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=0.0s)]
*  That state needs new leadership [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=2.04s)]
*  and it looks like it's about to get it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=3.6s)]
*  As we told you, Lee Zeldin is running for governor. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=5.44s)]
*  A new poll today, an independent coefficient survey, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=7.84s)]
*  shows Zeldin leading the incumbent [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=10.56s)]
*  in the race for the first time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=13.56s)]
*  Congressman Lee Zeldin joins us now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=17.0s)]
*  It's pretty remarkable, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=19.36s)]
*  not that we didn't have faith in you as a person, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=21.16s)]
*  but I mean, it's an overwhelmingly democratic state [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  and you're now winning the governor's race? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=25.04s)]
*  First, congratulations. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=28.12s)]
*  Second, what do you attribute this to? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=29.84s)]
*  I mean, you have a governor [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=34.84s)]
*  who's just not doing a good job. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=35.76s)]
*  She's unlikable, she's corrupt, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=37.28s)]
*  she's pandering to criminals, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=39.28s)]
*  she's pandering to tax and spend liberals, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=41.2s)]
*  she's advancing woke policies [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=43.8s)]
*  as opposed to just focusing on what is most important [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  to New York voters. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  If she was tackling rising crime, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=50.32s)]
*  if she was tackling skyrocketing costs, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=51.96s)]
*  then this might be a different campaign. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=54.4s)]
*  But here we are talking about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=56.68s)]
*  how we need to remove district attorneys [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=58.6s)]
*  when they refuse to enforce the law. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  We don't have recall elections in New York, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=62.2s)]
*  but the governor does have the constitutional authority [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=63.92s)]
*  to get rid of a DA who refuses to do their job. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=66.44s)]
*  We're over here talking about the need [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=69.44s)]
*  to get rid of cashless bail [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=71.16s)]
*  and some of these other pro-criminal laws [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=73.04s)]
*  and we need to support our men and women in law enforcement [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=74.6s)]
*  who are being hung out to dry, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=77.56s)]
*  getting the handcuffs thrown on them [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=79.12s)]
*  as opposed to putting the handcuffs on criminals. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  We have a state ban on the safe extraction of natural gas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=83.2s)]
*  and now Kathy Hochul wants to get rid [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=86.12s)]
*  of all gas-powered vehicles here [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  over the course of the next decade. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=90.16s)]
*  We just had the new CDC guidance come out [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=92.72s)]
*  where they're adding the COVID vaccine into their list [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  and you have a governor who is talking about [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  as a possible consideration. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  Her past remarks have indicated [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=103.32s)]
*  that maybe she would mandate that for kids, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=105.44s)]
*  but we already have it being required on college students [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=107.24s)]
*  and we have people who are getting fired [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=110.64s)]
*  for their refusal to get the COVID vaccine, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=112.52s)]
*  like our healthcare workers who used to be held as heroes, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  now treated as zeros. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=117.32s)]
*  I'm somebody who believes that there should be [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=119.0s)]
*  no COVID vaccine on anyone, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  whether it's grade school, higher ed, employment, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=123.08s)]
*  or otherwise, and everyone who was fired [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  should be getting their jobs back with back pay. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=128.88s)]
*  So the contrast is clear [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  and even Democrats and independents are saying, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  you know what, we have to go a new direction [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=134.72s)]
*  in order to save this state. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=136.88s)]
*  Kathy Hochul has to go and she will on November 8th. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=138.16s)]
*  It sounds like she will. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=141.48s)]
*  It's just a remarkable story. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=142.76s)]
*  It kind of comes out of nowhere [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=144.0s)]
*  because again, it's so overwhelmingly democratic. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  It almost seems like she's trying to wreck the state. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  Where we are out here campaigning our tails off [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=154.04s)]
*  to earn the support of voters [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=157.0s)]
*  to do our part to save the state, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  Kathy Hochul right now is crawling across the finish line. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=160.68s)]
*  She's trying to survive this campaign [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=163.56s)]
*  and clearly her goal here is to save Kathy Hochul [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=165.84s)]
*  and the average voter out there in New York [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=169.72s)]
*  hitting their breaking point in the state. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  Listen, there's a reason why New York [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=173.12s)]
*  leads the entire nation in population loss, Tucker. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  And I don't even think that Kathy Hochul [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  can finish this sentence, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=178.88s)]
*  that New York leads the entire nation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=180.27999999999997s)]
*  in population loss because. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  And if you can't finish that sentence, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=184.11999999999998s)]
*  no one's gonna ever expect you to actually fix this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  and a lot of people pick up on it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=188.64s)]
*  So nicely put. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  Congratulations, Congressman Lee Zeldin of New York. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Hopefully the next governor looks like you will be. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mni9lK3qaKI&t=197.72s)]
