# Fox meteorologist recalls attack after stopping assault: 'They wanted to knock me out'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk)
*  Fox News meteorologist Adam Klotz was riding the New York City subway early Sunday when [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=0.0s)]
*  he saw an elderly man getting pushed around by teenagers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=5.16s)]
*  When he tried to intervene, the young men beat him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=8.36s)]
*  Three of those teens, aged 15 to 17, were just released without any charges by Manhattan's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=11.28s)]
*  DA Alvin Bragg. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=16.0s)]
*  So frustrating. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=17.8s)]
*  Adam Klotz is a Fox meteorologist. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=18.8s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=19.8s)]
*  Oh man, you look tough. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=20.8s)]
*  I am sorry. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=22.68s)]
*  I pulled this off all right, right? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=23.68s)]
*  Yeah, you pulled off quite well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=26.48s)]
*  And you did it in the service of a good deed, but I'm shocked. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=28.64s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=32.76s)]
*  I was on my way home from the Giants game. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=33.76s)]
*  I was watching it at a bar with some friends, so it's like 12.45 in the morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  And the car was fairly busy, so it was not like some desolate situation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=40.38s)]
*  A group of, I'd say, like, 17s, one started to light up a joint and with the lighter still [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=44.34s)]
*  in his hand, just put a live lighter in an elderly man's hair and it blew up like a matchbook. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=50.46s)]
*  His entire head was on fire and the guys knocking out his, and I was just sitting right [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=57.14s)]
*  there watching it and how can you not, whoa, guys, you can't do that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=61.0s)]
*  And then they just did not want to be told what they could or couldn't do. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=64.78s)]
*  So then suddenly the focus was on me and then you got a problem. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=67.88s)]
*  I said, yeah, you can't do that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=70.3s)]
*  And he's like, try to stop me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=71.7s)]
*  And you know, it just escalated and it was a group of seven guys. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=73.58s)]
*  So I caught a left, a pretty good left, kind of put my head back into the wall. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=77.06s)]
*  Another guy who was just down off to my right, it was again, a crowded car. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=81.16s)]
*  No one else said anything other than, hey, you should get off the car. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=83.86s)]
*  I actually moved to a whole other car on the train, like at a stop, moved to another car. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=87.18s)]
*  We go a whole other stop, the doors open. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=92.64s)]
*  I kind of think it's over. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=94.18s)]
*  These whole group comes and gang rushes me and jumps on me and just starts beating me [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=95.56s)]
*  and kicking me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=99.62s)]
*  I hear put him to sleep, put him to sleep, put him to sleep. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=100.8s)]
*  They wanted to knock me out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=103.7s)]
*  And my goal at that point is just like cover my head because once you're unconscious, who [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=105.22s)]
*  knows what's going to happen. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=108.56s)]
*  And I was able to avoid that, but I got kicked up and down the side, kind of stomped on. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=110.1s)]
*  I mean, they got their licks in for sure. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=114.66s)]
*  So these guys lit an old man on fire and then seven of them beat you to the ground. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=117.78s)]
*  Because they didn't like that anyone had anything to say. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=122.58s)]
*  Like, don't tell us what we can and can't do. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=125.46s)]
*  Well, you can see why Bernie Getz got off. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=128.9s)]
*  That's pretty unbelievable. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=132.42s)]
*  Adam Klotz, what a, that's a shocking story and I'm glad you're okay. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=138.22s)]
*  Thank you for doing that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW8IpL2rTgk&t=139.22s)]
