# Tucker reacts to woke actress' radical claim on racism
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4)
*  Oh, the climate crisis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=0.0s)]
*  The climate, it's not natural. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=2.16s)]
*  It's not like the glaciers. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=3.24s)]
*  You're causing it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  How are you causing that? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=6.54s)]
*  Well, Jane Fonda has thought a lot about that topic [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=7.7s)]
*  and here's her conclusion. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=9.8s)]
*  If there were no racism, there'd be no climate crisis. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=11.28s)]
*  If there was no misogyny, there'd be no climate crisis. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  It's part of a mindset. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  It's the mindset that looks at a woman and says, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=21.92s)]
*  nice. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=25.8s)]
*  In other words, my ex-husbands caused climate change. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=27.64s)]
*  In addition to everything else, it's all about her. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=31.92s)]
*  So great. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=36.32s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=37.28s)]

*  Stories that are changing the world and changing your life [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=41.64s)]
*  from Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtRQ6c0bn4&t=45.32s)]
