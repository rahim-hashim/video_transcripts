# Elon Musk is the right 'medicine' for Twitter: Payne
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw)
*  Charles Payne, host of Making Money with Charles Payne on Fox Business, understands this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=0.0s)]
*  He's been watching this since the beginning and doing what we cannot do, which is assessing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=4.72s)]
*  it as a business play. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=8.6s)]
*  And we're happy to have him join us now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=10.08s)]
*  Charles, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=12.08s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=13.72s)]
*  You know, Tucker, I wish I could go through every one of those things you talked about. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=14.72s)]
*  For instance, the folks on CNN, I feel like they've never even been to a garage sale. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he's negotiating Elon Musk for this piece. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=22.12s)]
*  MSNBC, he's a freeloader. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=26.2s)]
*  You got to be kidding me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=27.8s)]
*  He's got 99,000 employees and he's bringing factories back to America. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=28.8s)]
*  So from a business perspective, you've got a guy who sold a business for $176 million. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=33.92s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=39.28s)]
*  He plowed every single nickel into two pipe dreams. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=40.28s)]
*  One was called Tesla, one was called SpaceX. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=43.68s)]
*  The very same people that are saying he's unsophisticated today are the same ones who [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=45.96s)]
*  said he couldn't make it then. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=50.24s)]
*  Well, fast forward to his wealth net worth being $276 billion right now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=51.72s)]
*  You know, the notion of free speech in America ever becoming controversial in and of itself [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=58.04s)]
*  tells you we're in a dangerous place. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=63.92s)]
*  Someone talked about the quote unquote orange man. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=66.56s)]
*  Let me tell you about the orange man. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=68.88s)]
*  When President Trump was elected, Twitter stock was $16 a share. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  When President Trump left office, it was $77 a share and promptly went into freefall. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=74.64s)]
*  This is a company that really has shot themselves in the foot. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=80.12s)]
*  They're losing big time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=83.9s)]
*  They need fresh thinking out there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=85.08s)]
*  Elon Musk is the right medicine. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  It's the right medicine from a business perspective and it certainly is the right medicine for [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=89.36s)]
*  the ethos, for the foundation that America was founded on. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  Really quick, do you think Musk understands what's about to happen to him? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=99.12s)]
*  They're going to try and crush him for real. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=102.92s)]
*  He does because everything he has done, Tucker, they have tried to crush him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=105.5s)]
*  They have tried to crush Tesla at every turn. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=109.2s)]
*  The White House hates Tesla because it's a non-union shop. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  They have tried to beat him down every single way they can. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=115.28s)]
*  He knows the challenge. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=118.44s)]
*  By the way, that's why he made it 54-20. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=119.44s)]
*  He gave them a shot. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=122.36s)]
*  He knew they would make fun of it, but that's how Elon Musk operates. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=123.44s)]
*  He says, come at me, baby. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=126.44s)]
*  Come at me because he is a winner and guess what? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  All they have is opinions. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=131.04s)]
*  If this works and Twitter is opened up to free speech and Elon Musk is still standing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=134.96s)]
*  a year from now, it will be a different country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=139.12s)]
*  It will be. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=140.84s)]
*  A better country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=141.84s)]
*  Charles Payne, I appreciate you're coming on tonight. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=142.84s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=143.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9_bj-nmmw&t=144.84s)]
