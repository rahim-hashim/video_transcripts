# African reporter hits back at Karine Jean-Pierre for not calling on him
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw)
*  If you want to know what a complete sham, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=0.0s)]
*  what a fraudulent, grotesque perversion of reality [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=3.84s)]
*  the White House briefings have become, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=7.82s)]
*  you should see what happened today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=10.0s)]
*  The low IQ White House press secretary [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=11.24s)]
*  brought in a bunch of TV actors to stand there [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=12.92s)]
*  so she could promote a TV show for some reason. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=15.44s)]
*  Why are we doing this again? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=17.88s)]
*  She never really explained. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=19.12s)]
*  Mental health day or something. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  None of them were doctors. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=21.48s)]
*  But at the same time, even as she was promoting a TV show, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=24.04s)]
*  the White House press secretary [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=26.88s)]
*  refused to take questions from actual reporters. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=28.32s)]
*  First on that list would be our friend, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  Simon Atiba of Today News Africa. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=32.72s)]
*  So today, Atiba just got frustrated [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=35.2s)]
*  and called out the White House press secretary [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=36.82s)]
*  for ignoring his actual questions for months. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=39.4s)]
*  Watch what happened next. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=41.92s)]
*  What you are doing, you are making a mockery [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=44.16s)]
*  of the first American. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Please, the quorum, please. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=46.6s)]
*  It's been seven months, you've not called on me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=48.84s)]
*  The quorum. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=50.6s)]
*  No, I'm saying that that's not right. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=51.44s)]
*  On time, welcome, guys. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  Welcome to the press briefing room. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=57.32s)]
*  This is not right. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=58.64s)]
*  This is not China. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  This is not Russia. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=60.32s)]
*  This is the United States. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=61.16s)]
*  This is the White House. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=62.64s)]
*  It's been seven months. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=64.48s)]
*  I thank you so much. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=65.72s)]
*  The rest of us are here too, pal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=66.56s)]
*  It's been seven months. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=68.48s)]
*  You guys have not done anything for me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=69.56s)]
*  If you have grievances, you should bring them to her later. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=71.2s)]
*  I have done that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=73.92s)]
*  I have done that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=74.76s)]
*  All my emails have been ignored. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=75.6s)]
*  And the press corps is tired of dealing with this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=77.16s)]
*  It is not about you, Simon. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=80.48s)]
*  I understand that you get questions all the time [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=81.72s)]
*  and you don't do something like this, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=83.68s)]
*  to sit here for eight months and being discriminated against. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  I understand that you're in the front row [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=88.12s)]
*  and you've been constipated. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=90.0s)]
*  And you get questions all the time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=91.36s)]
*  But there are people in the back who don't get any questions. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Don't make assumptions about what the rest of us do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=95.76s)]
*  Mind your manners when you're in here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  If you have a problem, you bring it up afterwards. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=99.44s)]
*  What has just occurred this last 10, 15 minutes is unacceptable. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=101.44s)]
*  It is unacceptable. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=106.64s)]
*  So we're either going to continue the briefing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  or we can just end the briefing right here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=112.76s)]
*  Outrageous doesn't even describe what we just played for you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=116.04s)]
*  So here you have the White House press secretary [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=119.2s)]
*  whose job it is to answer questions from journalists [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=121.64s)]
*  on behalf of the entire American population, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  hijacking the event to promote a TV show [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  and then screaming at a guy who wants his questions answered. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  And then the other shills in the room [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=133.28s)]
*  don't take the side of their fellow journalists, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=136.52s)]
*  but take the side of the lady at the front [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  to whom they are actually beholden [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=141.76s)]
*  and try and shut down Simon Atiba. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=143.64s)]
*  Who did that? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  This is a partial list that would include Jeff Mason of Reuters, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  who should be ashamed, Brian Karam of CNN, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=150.44s)]
*  Associated Press correspondent Zeke Miller. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=154.56s)]
*  He even apologized to the press secretary [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=157.44s)]
*  later in the press conference. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  They, again, should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=160.72s)]
*  And previous generations of reporters [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  would have turned on them. Really, you're taking her side? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=165.68s)]
*  She's a liar? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=167.92s)]
*  Your job is not to suck up to power. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=169.32s)]
*  It's to serve your viewers and readers [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  by getting to the truth. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=173.84s)]
*  But instead they piled on Simon Atiba. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=176.12s)]
*  Really the most revealing moment [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  maybe ever in the White House press room. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=179.12s)]
*  We are honored now to be joined by Simon Atiba himself. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Simon, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=185.88s)]
*  We're really glad to have you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=187.2s)]
*  What prompted, you seem very frustrated there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=188.68s)]
*  What prompted your exchange with the press secretary? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=191.4s)]
*  Yes. Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=196.32s)]
*  Thank you for having me on your show. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=197.4s)]
*  I'm grateful. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=198.92s)]
*  You know, the First Amendment protects the freedom of speech, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  the press and assembly, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=204.28s)]
*  and the right to petition your government to seek redress. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=206.11999999999998s)]
*  And that First Amendment says that I have the right [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  to ask questions, to do my job. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=213.88s)]
*  And the press secretary doesn't need to like me, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=215.64s)]
*  date me, marry me, have two black children with me. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=218.72s)]
*  She doesn't need all that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=221.44s)]
*  She doesn't even need to like my accent. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=223.04s)]
*  Doesn't need to like what I look like, where I come from. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=225.04s)]
*  They look down on me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=228.8s)]
*  They don't respect the First Amendment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  And so what has been happening in the White House [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  is in the past seven months, I've done all the right things. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  I've not been called on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=239.68s)]
*  I've gone to her office to seek a meeting. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=241.68s)]
*  She said that she will meet with me next year. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=243.8s)]
*  I've sent questions about the Nigerian election, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=246.56s)]
*  about, you know, the problems, challenges in Africa. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=249.44s)]
*  And they've not called on me, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  even as the vice president is going to Africa, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=255.36s)]
*  even as the first lady, Jill Biden, went to Africa. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=258.12s)]
*  Even when they receive 50 African leaders [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=262.12s)]
*  for the U.S.-African summit in Washington, D.C., [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=265.28s)]
*  the guy who covers the White House, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  the African guy who covers the White House, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=271.84s)]
*  is looked down upon in the greatest country in the world, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  in the most advanced country [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=278.68s)]
*  where freedom of speech is protected. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=280.2s)]
*  It's a shame what happened today. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=283.36s)]
*  One of the guys that you showed there now, Brian, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  he was kicked out of the WACA [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=287.48s)]
*  because he became violent in the Rose Garden. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a disgrace. It's very violent. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZI8ZvjD8tw&t=293.96000000000004s)]
