# Ye reveals he didn't know how close ex-wife Kim Kardashian was to Clintons
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw)
*  The first indication that West might become a massive problem for the industrial deception complex came in 2015 and 2016 when Donald Trump appeared and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=0.0s)]
*  West had a very strong gut reaction to Trump that was very positive and the people around him were panicked by this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=9.96s)]
*  The last thing you could have is one of the most popular pop culture figures in America [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=16.34s)]
*  Coming out for Donald Trump's they applied intense pressure to get him back on the script [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=21.8s)]
*  Apparently his wife was part of that his former wife Kim Kardashian who West now learns had a very close relationship [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=26.2s)]
*  With the Clintons and people around the Clintons [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=32.32s)]
*  He had no idea his relationship with Trump on the other hand [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=35.16s)]
*  Flourished and he got a window into the people around Trump and in this clip you'll hear him assess [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=38.76s)]
*  What happened inside the White House very interesting watch? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  It was interesting a friend of mine told me that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=49.92s)]
*  Chris and Kim had called him because he had influence inside of the black community [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  And had called him [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=61.92s)]
*  To say oh to get him to influence people to take the vaccination [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=67.08s)]
*  mm-hmm and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=74.08s)]
*  I [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=76.08s)]
*  Don't have opinion on that I just want to state that as a flat statement, but it was [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=81.84s)]
*  It was wild that I didn't know how close my own wife was to the Clintons. I [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=86.0s)]
*  didn't know you know I [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=94.0s)]
*  Didn't realize it at the time that you were married to her and while I was married to her [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=97.2s)]
*  How close was she to the Clintons? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=102.32s)]
*  I mean cell phone away like or hey tell you to say this away or hey [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=106.24s)]
*  Go out and use your platform to push [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=111.52s)]
*  The vaccination away. I mean not away, but like sick the away part [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  But do you feel like at times you were manipulated by political forces through your wife? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=118.08s)]
*  Attempt [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=124.84s)]
*  Manipulation, but yes, there was some manipulation me not saying I like Trump. It was a form of a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=126.28s)]
*  Manipulation for sure. Yeah, why did you like him? By the way, you said you liked him early like you saw him under I mean [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=132.96s)]
*  I keep telling this joke if people say Trump was the first black president [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=143.68s)]
*  I'm gonna be the first Latino president because all the values the the conservative values just line up [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=148.14s)]
*  Come on, man. Trump's this way me has his own buildings. We talked about he's like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=155.68s)]
*  Like Ralph Lauren, yeah, he made Ivanka [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=161.02s)]
*  You like Ivanka yeah [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=165.86s)]
*  You tweet you wrote a post on Instagram about her husband today [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=169.18s)]
*  Yeah, you know I [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  had a dinner with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  Ivanka Jared and Josh and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=180.82000000000002s)]
*  A couple days later. I found out that Josh Kushner had 10% [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=184.74s)]
*  of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=190.9s)]
*  Skims, which is a line that I had developed with Kim [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=191.94s)]
*  And I had a lot of issues with the imagery of skims [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=196.58s)]
*  I felt like there's a lot of imagery that was overly sexualized and things that I wouldn't want to see [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  My wife and definitely not my daughter's doing in the future in order to sell product [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=208.06s)]
*  But it reaches another level when it's like, okay, well [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=215.26000000000002s)]
*  This is what my wife is doing and this is what they're doing for this is what she's doing for our children [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=220.02s)]
*  but it reaches another level when her business partners are [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  Selling pieces of company that they don't have to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=229.74s)]
*  Because the company's already so successful and it's a internet based company [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=232.78s)]
*  So it's like they're really just selling off the company in order to create more relationships for themselves that are unneeded [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  it's like when I went to the gap and with our release they just like [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=243.86s)]
*  They shoveled it out I'm very cautious with my words [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=247.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm really big on being able to have an adult conversation in front of the children. So I don't use [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=250.1s)]
*  explicit language [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=256.98s)]
*  in interviews, especially so I [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=258.58s)]
*  Found out after this dinner that Josh Kushner had 10% of skims and I had 5% of skims and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=262.42s)]
*  regardless if [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=272.42s)]
*  Josh Kushner figured out how to put [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=274.74s)]
*  150 million dollars. I'm sure it wasn't out of his own account, but 150 million and I'm sure Jarrett still has a piece of that fun [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=278.26s)]
*  They [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=288.18s)]
*  Regardless of them putting that money in for me to have been a owner in it and not known [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=289.38s)]
*  Just from a place as a creative where skims is so [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=295.86s)]
*  Based on a lot of the easy ideas [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  Then it's based on all of the relationships [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=302.82s)]
*  in fashion because I had to use my relationships in fashion in order to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  establish Kim in a way where [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=311.62s)]
*  Fashionable people say hey, I'm I'm I'm down to where Kim's line [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=315.14s)]
*  And these vcs they come in and they get a piece of it [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=320.5s)]
*  After the fact and they run around and say they have ownership in it [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=324.34s)]
*  So as I put on my instagram, which [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  You know luckily for everyone they could just write it off that you know [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=330.42s)]
*  I'm crazy until they see my disposition in this interview and then it's going to get scary [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=333.94s)]
*  They [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=341.06s)]
*  I said hey Josh, what if uh, what if I had 10% of carly claus's lingerie [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=345.06s)]
*  Shapewear swimsuit [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=352.74s)]
*  Line and you have five percent of it and you didn't know [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=354.74s)]
*  How would that make you feel [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=363.06s)]
*  And then after talking to them and really sitting with Jared and sitting with Josh [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=367.86s)]
*  And finding out other pieces of information. I was like, wow. These guys might have really been holding trump back [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=374.26s)]
*  These guys might have really been holding trump back [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=380.82s)]
*  And being very much a handler [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=385.06s)]
*  Right then they love to just look at me or look at trump like we're so crazy and that they're the businessmen [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=387.53999999999996s)]
*  so when I think about all of these things that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=394.97999999999996s)]
*  Jared's, you know [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=398.5s)]
*  Somehow doesn't get enough credit for with his work. And what is it his work in israel or his work in palette? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=400.74s)]
*  What is this, you know where he made these peace treaties [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=408.17999999999995s)]
*  Where was that? Do you know the facts on this right here? So i'm like, well, I think that was between israel and some of the arab nations [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  I just think it was to make money [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=417.78s)]
*  I don't know. Is that is that too heavy-handed to put on this platform? No, that's that's your opinion [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=421.21999999999997s)]
*  We're not in a censorship business. Okay. Thank you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=429.38s)]
*  I just think that that's what they're about [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=430.58s)]
*  Is making money. I don't think that they have the ability to make anything [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=433.14s)]
*  On their own. I think they're born into money [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=437.62s)]
*  and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=440.18s)]
*  For me is a maverick and a talent and a person that's been [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=441.46000000000004s)]
*  You know beat kicked [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  Lost everything [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=448.42s)]
*  Sad to have lost my mind [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=449.94s)]
*  Went from pull myself [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=452.34000000000003s)]
*  Up by my boot. My boots don't have straps on them, but I say pull myself up from my boots [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=454.5s)]
*  uh to becoming a multi-billionaire that gets [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=459.86s)]
*  uh that gets [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  you know, um [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=466.82s)]
*  The the price every year of my network goes down every year [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=468.58s)]
*  On forbes. They just keep on slowly just taking it down every year. It's like really a weird thing [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=473.46000000000004s)]
*  But as a person that has really built something from nothing [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=478.26s)]
*  when I sit across [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=482.98s)]
*  The table from a josh kushner and he just feels [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=485.06s)]
*  so entitled [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=488.66s)]
*  to that idea [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=490.18s)]
*  And this person has never brought anything of value [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=492.5s)]
*  Other than so-called being a good venture capitalist [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=495.94s)]
*  I have a major I have a major issue with that and it makes me feel like they weren't serving my boy trump [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=499.21999999999997s)]
*  the way we could have because [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=506.9s)]
*  you know [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=509.38s)]
*  Trump wanted nothing but the best for this country and it doesn't [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=510.58s)]
*  like [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=515.46s)]
*  Moses stuttered and saying god is not always going to bring the most perfect personality [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=516.9s)]
*  A lot of times the most fake people their job [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=522.68s)]
*  Is talking and making people feel comfortable. Yeah, you know and the realest people are going to make you feel uncomfortable [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=527.0799999999999s)]
*  At first [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=535.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's not shallow and it's also not crazy it's true whether you agree with it or not [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOGB-eSvqw&t=540.1999999999999s)]
