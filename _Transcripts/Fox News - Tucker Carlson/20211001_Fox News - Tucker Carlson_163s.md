# Tucker exposes political operatives in the media
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM)
*  It's pretty obvious at this point that the big legacy media organizations aren't actually news organizations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=0.0s)]
*  They're partisan political operations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=6.0s)]
*  But still, at least on paper, these organizations have rules they're supposed to follow. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=8.16s)]
*  Rules like news executives can't donate to political campaigns. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=13.0s)]
*  That would be improper, it would be an obvious evidence of bias. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=16.8s)]
*  So it's not allowed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=21.12s)]
*  But it happens. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=22.68s)]
*  And this shows just obtained emails demonstrating that in private, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=23.52s)]
*  that news executives don't care about the rules or the concept of impartiality. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=26.36s)]
*  They'll donate to any candidate they want. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=30.08s)]
*  They just want to make certain you don't find out about it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=32.2s)]
*  The emails came to us from a source with access to Hunter Biden's laptop, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=34.72s)]
*  the one he left at the computer repair shop, supposedly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=38.32s)]
*  Not sure we believe that story, but the laptop itself is absolutely real. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=42.16s)]
*  And these documents show that a CNBC executive used his wife to dodge company rules [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=45.72s)]
*  that bar financial contributions to political campaigns. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=51.04s)]
*  In 2015, Breitbart first reported the wife of a man called Brian Steele, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=54.16s)]
*  who until recently was an executive vice president at CNBC, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  was a Hillary Clinton donor, a big Hillary Clinton donor. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=62.36s)]
*  That report came to light after a CNBC Republican debate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  that featured several biased questions favoring Democrats. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=69.24s)]
*  It was pretty over the top. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=71.92s)]
*  Actually, it's on YouTube. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=72.96s)]
*  Treat yourself some time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=74.32s)]
*  But the emails from Hunter Biden's laptop show that Brian Steele's wife [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=76.12s)]
*  was spending that money at his direction, which we think is illegal, actually. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=79.64s)]
*  We'll leave that to the lawyers to determine, but here are the facts. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=84.76s)]
*  In September 2016, Hunter Biden emailed Steele to invite him to a fundraiser [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=87.72s)]
*  for a former Biden aide who was running for Congress in South Carolina. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=92.44s)]
*  The candidate was called Francis Fran Person. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  Steele responded this way, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=99.4s)]
*  by having my wife donate. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=109.64s)]
*  But after CNBC hosted a controversial, aggressive Republican primary debate [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=111.56s)]
*  earlier this year, Breitbart and Rush Limbaugh outed me [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=116.28s)]
*  as the husband of a Max Hillary donor, so I can't have Eileen donate anymore. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=119.32s)]
*  Explicit, anyone? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=127.08s)]
*  Steele was at CNBC from 2007 to just recently, a month or so ago, 2021. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=129.16s)]
*  During that time, his wife donated $16,000 to Democrats. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=136.36s)]
*  How much of that money was given at his direction? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  We've reached out to Steele and to CNBC for comment, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=144.12s)]
*  neither one has gotten back to us, not surprisingly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_snDNE1YM&t=147.16000000000003s)]
