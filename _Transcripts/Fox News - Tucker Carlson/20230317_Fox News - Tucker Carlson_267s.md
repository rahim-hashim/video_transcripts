# 'Tucker Carlson Tonight': You can now rent sheep to mow your lawn
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280)
*  Happy St. Patrick's Day. Hey look, some ideas are so smart it's hard to believe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=0.0s)]
*  that no one ever thought of them before. This here is one of those ideas. If you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=5.04s)]
*  ever mowed the lawn or thought it has to be a better and easier way to do this, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=9.28s)]
*  guess what? You were right. There is a better way to do it. You can just rent [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  some lambs to do it for you. A new company lets you hire lamb mowers [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=17.8s)]
*  instead of lawn mowers. Corey Souter is the owner of lambmowers.com. He's based [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=23.36s)]
*  in Fairfax County and Corey joins us now to explain. And you have your labor force [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=28.56s)]
*  behind you, Corey. How is it no one has thought of this? You've got to tell me [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=34.68s)]
*  about your inspiration and the market demand for lamb mowers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=38.36s)]
*  Ah, thanks so much, Will. I don't want to go out too much on a lamb here. I don't [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=44.36s)]
*  know if you wanted me to ram through some bad sheephounds, but I'm really honored to be on [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=49.96s)]
*  your show. We're glad to have you here on Tucker Carlson tonight. Go ahead. I want to hear this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=56.48s)]
*  I have a ton of questions about your workforce there and their appetite. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Will, we are the only licensed and insured landscaping company that also gets invited [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=68.72s)]
*  to kids' birthdays and evening wine parties. We also have a lot of customers that just hire us to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  get rid of the weeds. And that's what makes me so passionate about what I do. I got into [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=81.28s)]
*  lambmowers.com because I care about conserving soil and water resources for future generations. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=86.4s)]
*  And my sheep do a wonderful job of putting organic matter back in soil where it belongs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=93.92s)]
*  And I have a lot of happy customers. Brings people a lot of joy to have sheep in their yard. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Putting organic matter back into the soil where it belongs. Does that mean I have to hire like a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=106.72s)]
*  poop pickup service after you mow my lawn with the lambs? You fertilize as you cut the lawn? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=112.4s)]
*  So my sheep do provide some biodegradable fertilizer pellets. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=120.48s)]
*  And yeah, if you're putting the lawn clippings back on the lawn, that's what our soil needs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=125.12s)]
*  All of our soils here in the U.S. used to have over 8% organic matter. And now we're back down [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=131.28s)]
*  to only around half a percent in a lot of our farmland. And that just means there's not a lot [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=136.56s)]
*  of nutrients left in that soil to feed us. It fuels the obesity epidemic in the U.S. to have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=141.12s)]
*  soils that are depleted of nutrients and organic matter. And so I'm really passionate about soil [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=147.44s)]
*  health. And doing lambmowers is one way I help educate people about that. I've actually read [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=154.08s)]
*  a lot about that recently. According to your point, the soil has lost a lot of its nutritional [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=160.0s)]
*  value through industrial farming and widespread use of chemical fertilizer. And as we point out, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=163.84s)]
*  you're giving back. And I'm going to tell my wife the same thing when I don't pick up in the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=169.12s)]
*  backyard. I'm giving back to the soil right now. But Cory, really quick, the names... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=171.84s)]
*  That's right. Lazy gardening is great. The names of your workforce behind you, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  can you introduce me to a few of them? Sure. So right here in front of me, I think this is Oreo. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=181.12s)]
*  And then, okay, yeah, you can't see that. So do you see Snowy here, the cutest little lamb? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=188.96s)]
*  Yeah. And then right behind her is her mother, chocolate chip. Behind that's ice cream. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=194.08s)]
*  I'm picking up a theme. It looks like... Oh, okay. Yes. My kids helped name the sheep. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  I see. We really have a lot of fun. Cory, we got a little bit of a delay. That's fine. One of my [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=207.36s)]
*  kids named a sheep monster truck. So that must have been... We call him Monty for short. I hate [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=212.96s)]
*  to enforce gender stereotypes, but that must have been one of your sons. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=218.32s)]
*  Cory, I've seen the before and after pictures of your workforce there and what you've done [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  in the backyards of many overgrown neighborhoods. Your lambs eating through what no lawnmower or [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=227.76s)]
*  weed eater can make their way through. So it's a fascinating business. It's an opening in the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  market. It's giving back, as you point out, to the planet. And we wish you and marshmallow and Oreo [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  and monster truck all the best in your business, lamb mowers. Thank you, Cory. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=243.2s)]
*  Oh, thank you so much for supporting a local small business. I really appreciate you having [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=248.64s)]
*  me on the show, Will. You bet. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymSt03SQ280&t=253.44s)]
