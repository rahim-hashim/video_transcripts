# DeSantis tells Tucker this is a really serious threat to our country
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c)
*  So the open borders crisis is not just affecting Texas and Arizona and California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=0.0s)]
*  Two weeks ago, hundreds of migrants landed in the Florida Keys. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=4.96s)]
*  So many arrived, they shut down a national park. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=8.28s)]
*  There are no signs that this invasion is going to stop. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=10.88s)]
*  So the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, has just activated the Florida National Guard. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=13.8s)]
*  He's also announced he's considering another major step to secure this country's borders, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=19.12s)]
*  or at least his state's borders. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=22.96s)]
*  He says he's weighing a ban that prevent China from purchasing real estate in Florida. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=25.2s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida joins us now to explain. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  Governor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=32.24s)]
*  So you're activating the National Guard. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=34.0s)]
*  What will they do? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=35.6s)]
*  So they've been heavy in this ever since we activated Tucker over the last week to 10 days. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=38.48s)]
*  Basically, Biden is leaving the Coast Guard out to dry. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=43.68s)]
*  He's not sending any more vessels, any more support. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=47.4s)]
*  They don't have enough to intercept all the boats that are trying to come [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=51.08s)]
*  primarily from Cuba, but also from Haiti. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  So what we're doing with our assets, we're out there in the Florida Straits. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=58.04s)]
*  We're using reconnaissance. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=62.6s)]
*  We are alerting to the Coast Guard when boats are there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=64.24s)]
*  We're stopping boats and then the Coast Guard are picking these folks up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=67.2s)]
*  And here's the thing, Tucker. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=70.92s)]
*  You know, we think that some of this is absolutely being orchestrated by the Cuban government. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=72.52s)]
*  We think there's a lot of human smuggling going on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=77.44s)]
*  So not only is this not good for the Florida Keys to have people dumped on on on their property, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  some of these people that are on these boats are being mistreated. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=87.28s)]
*  And so I think we've seen a decline in the number of vessels that are in the water. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=90.28s)]
*  We have not had as many landings, actually very few lately. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=95.28s)]
*  So it is working as a deterrent, but it's our sense that they're going to start trying to change their tactics. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  So we're going to be watching and we're going to be responding in kind. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=104.8s)]
*  The fact that you're willing to do this is itself a deterrent to smugglers, of course. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  So one of the challenges in Florida, so many people have moved here, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=112.52s)]
*  that real estate prices have gotten really high. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=115.4s)]
*  Foreign countries, China specifically, buying up more real estate doesn't help any American. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  This is happening in other states as well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=122.92s)]
*  What is your idea for dealing with this? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  We want no CCP land purchases, and obviously they're not going to do it directly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=129.08s)]
*  They will have shell companies. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  So we're going to have to have a system in place to scrutinize this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=135.96s)]
*  But why would we want them buying farmland? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=139.08s)]
*  They had very little farmland in the United States even 10 years ago. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=141.16s)]
*  Now they have significant holdings, not as much in Florida, but you do have it in other parts of the country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=145.0s)]
*  Why would we want the CCP to own land near a military base or own critical infrastructure? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=150.6s)]
*  So we're looking for a flat ban. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=156.84s)]
*  And so we're going to work with the Florida legislature to get that done. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=158.96s)]
*  Tucker, American policymakers for a generation have been empowering the CCP. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=162.0s)]
*  They said it would end up working out China would become a democracy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=167.64s)]
*  In fact, this is a very serious threat to our country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=170.56s)]
*  Why would we want them to have even more influence over American society than they already do? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=174.56s)]
*  So very short question, Governor, these two things, using the National Guard to protect the borders [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=181.4s)]
*  and preventing a hostile foreign nation from buying up farmland. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=185.52s)]
*  These are things a lot of other states can be doing, but aren't doing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=188.68s)]
*  Were they hard for you to do? Is this super hard? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=190.76s)]
*  Well, the National Guard, we control. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=195.28s)]
*  I mean, we're putting resources. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=197.24s)]
*  We have a big budget surplus, Tucker, so we can do that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=199.0s)]
*  And people are very happy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=202.0s)]
*  You know, we're taking care of the vessels that are landing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, the homeowners would have to pay twenty five hundred dollars a pop. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  So we're stepping in where the federal government's failing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=209.76s)]
*  I think more states can do it, Tucker. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=212.12s)]
*  But honestly, we should not have to be doing this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=213.84s)]
*  The federal government should be taking care of the immigration issue [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=216.76s)]
*  and they should be taking care of the CCP issue. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=220.28s)]
*  And with this administration, we know neither of those two things are going to happen. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  We're grateful you're doing it. Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=228.72s)]
*  Governor, I understand this is Florida. Appreciate it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=230.04s)]
*  Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=233.32s)]
*  Stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmE9qS753c&t=240.51999999999998s)]
