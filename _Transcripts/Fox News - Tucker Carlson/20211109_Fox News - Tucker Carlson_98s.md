# Tucker: This is Obama's threat to voters
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo)
*  So Barack Obama went to Virginia to get his old friend, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=0.0s)]
*  Terry McAuliffe, elected governor. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=2.68s)]
*  That didn't work well. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=4.4s)]
*  So he split, he fueled up his private jet, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=6.2s)]
*  and he flew to Glasgow, Scotland. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=8.4s)]
*  And while he was there, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  he immediately started slinging the cliches. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=11.48s)]
*  Our genius president speaks almost entirely in cliches, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=13.64s)]
*  which is what dumb people do, that's how you know. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=16.52s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=18.96s)]
*  Since we're in the Emerald Isles here, he said, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=19.88s)]
*  let me quote the bard, William Shakespeare. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=24.88s)]
*  First of all, Emerald Isle refers of course to Ireland, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=27.68s)]
*  not to Scotland. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=29.64s)]
*  Scotland is not an aisle anyway, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=30.48s)]
*  and Shakespeare is the national bard of England, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=32.28s)]
*  not of Scotland, asked the Scots. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  But whatever, more cliches heaped upon one another. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=36.32s)]
*  The real point of Obama showing up was to remind everyone [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=40.16s)]
*  that there was a silver lining that got to hear from him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=43.84s)]
*  Jesus is here, watch. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=46.44s)]
*  Even though I'm not required [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=49.32s)]
*  to attend summits like this anymore, old habits die hard. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=50.96s)]
*  And when the issue at hand is the health of our planet, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=56.0s)]
*  and the world, our children, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=60.68s)]
*  and our grandchildren will inherit, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=62.76s)]
*  then you will have a hard time keeping me away. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=64.88s)]
*  Because when it comes to climate, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=67.44s)]
*  time really is running out. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=70.16s)]
*  Vote the issue. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Vote like your life depends on it because it does. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=76.64s)]
*  Vote Democrat or you will die. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=81.28s)]
*  You will die. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=83.52s)]
*  Republicans ought to try that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9RjPuRGxo&t=84.8s)]
