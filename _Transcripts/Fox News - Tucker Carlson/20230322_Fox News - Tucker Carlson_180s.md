# Harmeet Dhillon tells Tucker Alvin Bragg's case against Trump is 'election interference'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo)
*  Hermit Dillon is the founder of the Dillon Law Group. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=0.0s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=1.84s)]
*  Hermit, I mean, this is clear even [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=2.88s)]
*  to the president of Mexico. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=6.04s)]
*  It's clear to everybody, Tucker, and I [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=10.56s)]
*  think it may even be clear to members of the grand jury [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=12.76s)]
*  in New York. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=15.6s)]
*  And I think that's why we saw not the expected indictment come [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=16.2s)]
*  down today, but rather a cancellation of today's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=19.92s)]
*  session. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=22.2s)]
*  Now in New York, the grand jury meets [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=22.7s)]
*  on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays typically. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=24.44s)]
*  And they're on call for tomorrow. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=27.48s)]
*  So it's quite possible that people are reading too much [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=28.88s)]
*  into this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=31.52s)]
*  And tomorrow we'll see what was meant to happen today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=32.0s)]
*  But some of the leaks that we've seen out of the proceedings [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=34.68s)]
*  and out of the DA's office suggest [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=37.72s)]
*  that the DA is getting pushback from the grand jury. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=39.28s)]
*  And that may be as a result of the testimony of the witness [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=42.56s)]
*  that you had on your show on Monday, Robert Costello, who [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=46.76s)]
*  testified that he had evidence about Michael Cohen's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=50.3s)]
*  credibility that had not been presented to the grand jury. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=56.48s)]
*  And so if I were a grand juror and I heard that hundreds [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=59.64s)]
*  of documents that impacted on the outcome of this case [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=62.12s)]
*  had not been presented to me by the DA, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=64.7s)]
*  I'd have some serious questions. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=67.2s)]
*  And so I think that's maybe what happening. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=68.96s)]
*  And so far, Michael Cohen had bragged [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  that he was going to be coming in to testify as a rebuttal [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=72.52s)]
*  witness, but that did not happen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=74.96s)]
*  So maybe that's going to happen tomorrow. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=76.56s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=78.56s)]
*  So tomorrow afternoon, there'll be another session [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=79.36s)]
*  of the grand jury. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=81.02s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  The letter that you showed earlier just now, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=83.28s)]
*  I think it goes to Michael Cohen's credibility [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  as does just about every piece of evidence [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  we've seen so far. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=89.56s)]
*  Which Michael Cohen should the grand jury be believing? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=90.64s)]
*  And I think that's really the import of that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  Not what really happened, but rather the credibility [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=95.2s)]
*  of the two witnesses, Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Super quick question. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=102.04s)]
*  People always say a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=103.4s)]
*  They always return an indictment. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  How weak does your case have to be for the grand jury [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=107.68s)]
*  to balk? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=110.2s)]
*  It has to be really weak. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  That adage has generally held true over the years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=113.98s)]
*  It's a majority of 23 that has to vote on this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=117.34s)]
*  They have been spending countless resources [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=120.58s)]
*  and years in this witch hunt, Tucker. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=124.26s)]
*  And so this is the best they can come up with. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=126.94s)]
*  Two very discredited witnesses with contradictory stories, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=129.74s)]
*  both of them repeatedly, documents that contradict [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=133.86s)]
*  the case, the case itself not being a crime, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  regardless of what Michael Cohen pled guilty to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=139.7s)]
*  under duress, as Robert Costello showed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=142.62s)]
*  So this is the best they can come up with [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=146.06s)]
*  after 11 million documents have passed hands [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=148.0s)]
*  in investigations about Donald Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=151.06s)]
*  I think that shows you just how far and how low [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=153.74s)]
*  they're willing to sink to try to get him, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=155.68s)]
*  which as I said before, is election interference [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=157.78s)]
*  in my opinion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=159.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a Manhattan grand jury. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=160.86s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=164.5s)]
*  Harmeet, thanks so much. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlzVfZpsJeo&t=165.46s)]
