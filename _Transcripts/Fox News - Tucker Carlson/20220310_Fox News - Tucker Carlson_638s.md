# Tucker: We should be very concerned about this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=0.0s)]
*  Last night we told you that the Biden administration [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=2.32s)]
*  is funding a number of secretive biolabs in Ukraine, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=4.44s)]
*  labs that are conducting experiments [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=7.8s)]
*  on highly dangerous pathogens. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=9.42s)]
*  Now that's not a story as we told you that we wanted to do. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  In fact, we didn't think it could be true. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=14.16s)]
*  It's so over the top and bizarre. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=16.42s)]
*  And in any case, the administration had repeatedly [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  and very aggressively denied [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=21.36s)]
*  that they were doing anything like this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=23.44s)]
*  And then they attacked anyone who asked questions about it [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=25.88s)]
*  as a tool of Russia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=28.52s)]
*  We foolishly assumed that in this one instance, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=30.16s)]
*  they might be telling the truth. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=32.94s)]
*  And then out of nowhere, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=35.04s)]
*  the Biden official in charge of Ukraine confirmed the story. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=36.34s)]
*  Toria Nuland, the undersecretary of state [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  casually mentioned in a Senate hearing on Tuesday [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=42.08s)]
*  that actually, yes, the Biden administration does fund [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=44.34s)]
*  a series of biolabs in Ukraine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  And whatever is in these labs is so dangerous [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  that she is deeply concerned these materials [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  will fall into the hands of the Russian military. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=55.68s)]
*  Now that struck us as a shocking development. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=59.04s)]
*  Once again, not for the first time, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=61.81999999999999s)]
*  what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  turned out to be true. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  Toria Nuland's testimony raised [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  at least two immediate questions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=70.08s)]
*  What exactly are these labs doing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=72.24s)]
*  with our money and in our name? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=73.96s)]
*  And why didn't the Biden administration [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=76.12s)]
*  secure the contents of these labs [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=78.19999999999999s)]
*  before the Russians invaded? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=80.28s)]
*  So far, we haven't received any answer at all [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  to the second question. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=84.84s)]
*  We think we're the only ones who've even asked it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  Whoever decided to leave deadly biological materials [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=88.28s)]
*  sitting in Ukraine as Russian troops massed on the border [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=90.88s)]
*  has not yet been identified. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=93.52s)]
*  We hope that person will be identified. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=95.24s)]
*  We'll keep asking. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=96.76s)]
*  As for the first question, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=98.64s)]
*  what exactly is going on in these labs? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=99.76s)]
*  We've gotten several answers, all of them insulting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=101.68s)]
*  Initially, the administration claimed [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=105.32s)]
*  that the labs were designed to help the Ukrainians [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=106.64s)]
*  fight tuberculosis as well as various livestock diseases. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=108.72s)]
*  That's what officials told members of Congress. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=112.44s)]
*  It didn't seem plausible and in fact, it's not plausible. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=114.8s)]
*  And then after our show last night, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=118.04s)]
*  the Pentagon released what it non-ironically called [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  a fact sheet designed to make the Biolab story [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=122.04s)]
*  seem small and ridiculous. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  Virtually every news organization in America, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=127.28s)]
*  with almost no exceptions, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  repeated the administration's claim verbatim [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=131.44s)]
*  with no verification of any kind. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=134.0s)]
*  Foreign Policy Magazine ran this version of it, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=137.16s)]
*  which is identical to many other versions you saw [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=139.44s)]
*  if you followed the news today. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=141.52s)]
*  Quote, fact check! [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=142.84s)]
*  DOD has worked with Ukraine to eliminate, in all caps, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=144.76s)]
*  bio-weapons left behind by the Soviet Union since 2005, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=148.2s)]
*  said a senior US Defense Intelligence official. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=151.44s)]
*  But these are not, again, in all caps, weapons labs, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=153.88s)]
*  as Russians falsely claim, the official said. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=157.32s)]
*  The Washington Post assured us of the same thing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=161.24s)]
*  So did countless other so-called news organizations. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=163.28s)]
*  Okay, so no big deal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=166.84s)]
*  This is not actually a story. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=168.36s)]
*  The Pentagon's been doing it since 2005, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=170.04s)]
*  working with Ukrainians to, quote, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=172.92s)]
*  eliminate biological weapons left behind by the Soviets. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=177.64s)]
*  But wait, 2005 was 17 years ago. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=179.72s)]
*  How long does it take to eliminate Soviet bio-weapons? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  17 years seems like a long time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  If you had 17 years and ample funding from Congress, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  you could probably remove and catalog [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=193.88s)]
*  every grain of sand on Waikiki Beach. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  And yet somehow, over that same period, 17 years, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  the Pentagon has not finished removing test tubes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=202.36s)]
*  from Soviet-era freezers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=205.0s)]
*  How does that work exactly? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=207.4s)]
*  How heavy are these bio-weapons? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=208.52s)]
*  Do we lack the transportation capacity [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=210.56s)]
*  to get them out of Ukraine [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=212.28s)]
*  and bury them in the desert in Nevada? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=213.24s)]
*  When was the Pentagon planning to finish this important job? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  In 20 years? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  In 50 years? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=219.8s)]
*  Those all seem like very obvious questions, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=221.84s)]
*  but not a single reporter asked any of those questions. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=224.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, over at CNN, perhaps aware [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=228.8s)]
*  that the first explanation didn't make sense [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  once you thought about it, offered a new alibi. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=232.48s)]
*  According to CNN's website, the labs in Ukraine [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  exist to quote, secure old Soviet weapons. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  Okay, secure, not eliminate, which raises the question, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=241.55999999999997s)]
*  what does it mean to secure a bio-weapon? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=245.55999999999997s)]
*  And again, why has it taken 17 years to do it? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=247.83999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, if these are really just old Soviet weapons, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=250.88s)]
*  why is Toria Nuland so worried [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=254.76s)]
*  they'll wind up in the hands of old Soviets [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=257.2s)]
*  who presumably already have these very same weapons? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=259.84s)]
*  Probably don't need more. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=263.35999999999996s)]
*  It's absurd when you think about it, so don't think about it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=265.79999999999995s)]
*  And that was the point of today's coverage [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=269.67999999999995s)]
*  of the Biden administration's secret Ukrainian bio labs. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=271.52s)]
*  Stop thinking about it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  Start accepting what they tell you at face value, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  otherwise you are an agent of Russia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=278.88s)]
*  Here's CNN. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=282.76s)]
*  The foreboding music, biohazard warnings. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=284.44s)]
*  This Russian state media footage from 2015 [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=287.44s)]
*  claims to show America running facilities in Ukraine and Georgia [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=290.44s)]
*  that caused deadly outbreaks of disease and killed local livestock. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=294.24s)]
*  This story is false, but that has not stopped it continuing to circulate, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=298.16s)]
*  evolving from biological hazards to biological weapons [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  and becoming a key part of Russia's economic system. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=306.0s)]
*  The claims were debunked several years ago [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=310.32s)]
*  when in 2020 the United States issued a statement [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  to quote set the record straight, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=315.68s)]
*  explaining the facilities are in fact for vaccine development [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=317.68s)]
*  and to report outbreaks caused by dangerous pathogens [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=321.08s)]
*  before they pose security or stability threats. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=324.0s)]
*  These claims were debunked several years ago. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=328.28s)]
*  These facilities works on vaccines, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=330.48s)]
*  but they are not the only ones that are debunked. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=332.68s)]
*  These claims were debunked several years ago. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=335.76s)]
*  These facilities works on vaccines and reporting outbreaks. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=337.88s)]
*  And then they play Russian propaganda. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=342.64s)]
*  The point is anyone who asks questions about this [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=344.84s)]
*  is repeating Russian propaganda. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=347.64s)]
*  Got it? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=350.56s)]
*  And the truth is we're not interested in what Russian propagandists say [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  about these Ukrainian bio labs. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=355.56s)]
*  We're not interested in what the propagandists at CNN say [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=357.08s)]
*  about these bio labs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=359.68s)]
*  We're Americans. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=360.88s)]
*  So we would like, in fact, we think we have a right to demand [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=362.12s)]
*  the Biden administration to answer simple questions, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=364.8s)]
*  straightforward questions. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=366.88s)]
*  These are obviously questions important enough [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=368.16s)]
*  to make Tori Nuland very nervous. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=369.76s)]
*  But why? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  We don't know. They won't answer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=373.88s)]
*  So instead, we did some digging of ourselves [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=375.6s)]
*  to see what we could find. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=377.36s)]
*  And here's what we came up with. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=378.2s)]
*  The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=379.56s)]
*  Robert Pope, the man who heads the Cooperative Threat Reduction [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  Program at DOD, sat for an interview with the website [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=385.24s)]
*  Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=388.36s)]
*  Pope is the man in charge of securing or eliminating [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=390.72s)]
*  Soviet era bio weapons. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=393.12s)]
*  So he knows a lot about the subject, maybe more than anyone else. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=394.52s)]
*  But it turns out that not all of these Soviet weapons [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=398.32s)]
*  are being destroyed or even secured. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=401.0s)]
*  And Pope acknowledged that in the interview, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=403.64s)]
*  which apparently CNN didn't see. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=406.08s)]
*  According to his interview, Pope said the labs, quote, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=408.28s)]
*  may hold pathogen strains left over from the Soviet bio weapons [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=410.96s)]
*  program preserved in freezers for research purposes. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=414.4s)]
*  Pope said that, quote, scientists being scientists, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=418.68s)]
*  it wouldn't surprise me if some of these strain collections [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=421.88s)]
*  and some of these laboratories still have pathogen strains that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=424.48s)]
*  go all the way back to the origins of that program, end quote. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=427.48s)]
*  In other words, because as Pope put it, scientists are scientists, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=432.56s)]
*  they don't want to destroy all the bio weapons. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=435.92s)]
*  Instead, they're using them to conduct new bio weapons research. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=439.04s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  And not just on strains left over from the Soviet Union. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=444.68s)]
*  The second line. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  In fact, the US embassy in Kiev has acknowledged [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  joint American and Ukrainian research on other pathogens, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=452.4s)]
*  such as hemorrhagic fever virus. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=455.88s)]
*  Apparently, there's a lot of this going on in Ukraine, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=458.44s)]
*  funded by the United States. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=460.52s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=461.96s)]
*  Why Ukraine? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=463.08s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=464.2s)]
*  We can only guess. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=464.88s)]
*  We do know that in 2010, the US government helped fund construction [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  of a brand new level three bio lab in Odessa, Ukraine. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  The purpose of that lab was not to eliminate or secure aging Soviet [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=475.28s)]
*  weapons, no. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=478.88s)]
*  That lab was designed for research on new end quote, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=480.28s)]
*  especially dangerous pathogens. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  In Ukraine, the poorest country in Europe. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=485.44s)]
*  Again, not a hotbed of biomedical research. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  Why Ukraine? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=491.91999999999996s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=493.79999999999995s)]
*  Someone should find out. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=494.64s)]
*  We do know that the Pentagon talking points you saw reported as fact [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=496.44s)]
*  on television today and last night were an utter lie. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=499.79999999999995s)]
*  Did the reporters who repeated those talking points verbatim [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=504.08s)]
*  know they were a lie? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=506.91999999999996s)]
*  Maybe they did. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  On the other hand, how would they know? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=509.44s)]
*  They didn't bother to do any reporting whatsoever. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=511.12s)]
*  They got a text from some Biden administration flack, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=515.04s)]
*  and they just read it on the air like it was true. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=517.48s)]
*  You shouldn't be surprised because that's what they do. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=520.76s)]
*  And it's possible they're afraid not to do that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=523.24s)]
*  They know if they stray from the script the White House has written [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=525.6s)]
*  for them, they'll be denounced from the briefing room as tools of Putin. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=528.04s)]
*  Here's Biden's publicist doing that very same thing today. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=533.04s)]
*  The main issue that prompted my Twitter thread yesterday [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=536.44s)]
*  was that Russia has a history also of inventing outright lies like this, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=540.16s)]
*  which is the suggestion that the United States has a chemical [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=545.36s)]
*  and biological weapons program or Ukraine does that they're operating. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=548.84s)]
*  Russia is the one, is the country that has a chemical [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=553.28s)]
*  and biological weapons program. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=555.92s)]
*  So the objective was to make clear the inaccuracy of the information, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=557.96s)]
*  the misinformation they're trying to put out and make clear to the world [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=564.96s)]
*  that they not only have the capacity, they have a history of using chemical [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=569.4000000000001s)]
*  and biological weapons and that in this moment we should have our eyes open. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=572.52s)]
*  Yeah, but no one denies that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=577.48s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  No one denies that Russia has a chem bio program. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=580.12s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=582.64s)]
*  No one denies that Russia lies, of course, and has for a long time, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=584.0400000000001s)]
*  that Russian propaganda is absolutely real, of course. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=588.12s)]
*  That's not for debate. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  That's all true. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=592.76s)]
*  The question is, why is the United States funding these bio labs [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=594.48s)]
*  that are not doing anything close to what the Pentagon claims they are doing? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=598.0s)]
*  Why is the White House press secretary from the podium contradicting [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=602.04s)]
*  what the director of the Pentagon's bio weapons control program [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=606.9200000000001s)]
*  has already admitted is true? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=610.64s)]
*  Why is she doing that? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=614.2s)]
*  And how should we feel about all of this? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=614.96s)]
*  Insulted, but also very concerned. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=617.2s)]
*  There is absolutely a story here, a story that matters. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=620.2s)]
*  Clearly, that's why they're lying about it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cwGscanAg&t=623.76s)]
