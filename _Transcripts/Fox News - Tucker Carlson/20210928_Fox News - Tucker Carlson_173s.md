# Marine being held in military lockup for criticizing Afghan exit
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ)
*  Tony Busby is one of the lawyers representing Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Scheller. He joins us tonight. Mr. Busby, thanks so much for defending this man. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=7.0s)]
*  And for coming on the show tonight. So if we misstated anything, is he in jail right now? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=8.0s)]
*  He's sitting in jail right now with no formal charges against him. Supposedly there's supposed to be a hearing on Thursday, but he doesn't even know what he's charged with. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=13.0s)]
*  And, you know, of course he still remains under this illegal gag order. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=25.0s)]
*  So this story broke, I think last night. In that time, how many members of Congress have reached out to you to say, we will no longer approve a single promotion in the U.S. military until this prisoner of conscience is freed? A lot? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=30.0s)]
*  None. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=44.0s)]
*  None. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=45.0s)]
*  And I tell you what's more infuriating is that today we had testimony in the Senate where they tried to make the case that the withdrawal was an operational success. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=46.0s)]
*  It's not a success, of course, to the 13 families who lost loved ones. And when somebody tried to speak out and say, look, we could have done a lot better. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=60.0s)]
*  They owed these Marines and sailors and Army personnel better than that. They not only told him to shut up, when he didn't shut up, they put him in jail. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=69.0s)]
*  He's a married man with children? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=80.0s)]
*  He's a married man, yes, with children. And I would say his spirits are high. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=83.0s)]
*  The support, not of course congressional support, but the support that we have received, that he has received, that his family has received has been overwhelming. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=87.0s)]
*  People see this for what it is. They see this from the top brass trying to shirk responsibility. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=95.0s)]
*  And when somebody in the chain of command speaks up, they're silenced. And we can do better than that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=101.0s)]
*  This is a man who is a 17-year Marine, a Marine officer, an infantry officer, just like I was, a guy who's conscious, required him to speak out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=106.0s)]
*  And the American military, and specifically the United States Marine Corps, the entity that I love so much, has put him in jail for that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=116.0s)]
*  People are just coming together all over the United States. The Pipe Hitter Organization, the Foundation, has raised already $200,000 for his defense. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=124.0s)]
*  This is wrong and will not stand. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=133.0s)]
*  You think of all those members of Congress who served six months in the JAG Corps somewhere and brag about their military service and how they're for the troops, and here are $24 billion dollars saying that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=136.0s)]
*  One word about this honorable man who is the best of America rotting in jail with criminals tonight for telling the truth, it's beyond belief. It's disgusting. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=147.0s)]
*  And I appreciate, Tony Busby, your defense of him. And I hope you'll come back. Thank you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=156.0s)]
*  Will do. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRGKnHIN1OQ&t=160.0s)]
