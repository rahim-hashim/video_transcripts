# Tucker: This is moral blackmail
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Monday. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=2.84s)]
*  No sane American approves of what Russia has done in Ukraine. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=3.92s)]
*  We certainly don't, and we don't know anyone who does. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  On Twitter, you see Democrats pretending [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=10.96s)]
*  that their political opponents are responsible [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=12.76s)]
*  for the invasion and somehow support it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=14.9s)]
*  So Joe Biden and his staff so mismanaged the world [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=17.48s)]
*  that Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=21.0s)]
*  after Biden told us for months [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=23.28s)]
*  he could prevent that from happening [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=24.92s)]
*  and yet all of it is your fault. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=26.76s)]
*  So that's a slanderous lie. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=30.12s)]
*  In this country, virtually everyone understands [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=31.72s)]
*  that the invasion of Ukraine is bad, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=33.84s)]
*  is bad for us and for the world, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=35.68s)]
*  and Vladimir Putin is bad too. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=37.44s)]
*  So effectively in America, those are settled facts. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=39.84s)]
*  We can stop debating them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=42.84s)]
*  The question is, what do we do next? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=44.44s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's badness doesn't absolve us [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  of our responsibility to think clearly [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  about how to protect this country [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=52.04s)]
*  and the rest of the free world in that order. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=53.96s)]
*  In fact, Putin's badness makes wise decision-making [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=56.72s)]
*  in the United States more important than ever [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=59.6s)]
*  and yet at the same time, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=61.88s)]
*  it makes wise decision-making harder to achieve. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=62.84s)]
*  It's not easy to see the long view when you're angry. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=65.36s)]
*  A writer called Tanner Green wrote a piece this morning [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=68.44s)]
*  which you should read, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=70.84s)]
*  it's entitled, Pausing at the Precipice. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=71.68s)]
*  Greer began by pointing out [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=74.36s)]
*  that Russia has obviously earned our contempt. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=76.08s)]
*  Most Americans now despise Vladimir Putin [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=78.56s)]
*  and that's understandable, they're outraged. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=80.76s)]
*  But moral outrage is not enough. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=83.18s)]
*  Moral outrage is not a foreign policy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=84.92s)]
*  In fact, Greer writes, moral outrage [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=87.28s)]
*  can be counterproductive. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=89.28s)]
*  It's clarifying, but here's the downside. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=90.76s)]
*  A righteous reaction may be a dangerous one. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=93.72s)]
*  In the field of power politics, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=96.64s)]
*  it is outcomes, not intentions that matter most. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=98.48s)]
*  Failure to slow down and examine the assumptions [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=102.84s)]
*  and motivations behind our choices [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=105.48s)]
*  may lead to decisions that feel right in the moment [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=107.64s)]
*  but fail to safeguard our interests, secure our values [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=111.0s)]
*  or reduce the human toll of war in the long run. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=114.82s)]
*  Exactly, nicely put. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=118.22s)]
*  Another way to express it would be this, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=120.58s)]
*  our leaders could easily turn this tragic [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=121.94s)]
*  and volatile moment into an historic disaster. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=124.33999999999999s)]
*  They've done it before. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  As of tonight, here are the two main things [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=128.78s)]
*  we ought to be worried about going forward. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=130.82s)]
*  First, and most obviously, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=133.18s)]
*  this war could get much worse than it already is. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=135.1s)]
*  We could see many Americans die. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=138.34s)]
*  Joe Biden is telling us [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=140.9s)]
*  he will not commit American troops to Ukraine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  Biden also claimed he opposed vaccine mandates. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=144.06s)]
*  So is he telling the truth? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=146.82s)]
*  Even if he is telling the truth [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=148.58s)]
*  about his intentions in this case, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=150.18s)]
*  Biden can't see the future. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=152.06s)]
*  Biden has no idea what will happen tomorrow or next week, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=153.54s)]
*  much less next year. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=155.94s)]
*  Nobody does. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=156.9s)]
*  We do know that already many in Washington [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=158.62s)]
*  are pushing for a hot war with nuclear armed Russia. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=160.54s)]
*  They're demanding a no-fly zone over Ukraine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=164.28s)]
*  That means American forces would shoot down Russian jets [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=167.02s)]
*  in Ukrainian airspace [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=170.12s)]
*  and also take out radar installations [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=171.46s)]
*  and other facilities within Russia itself. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=174.06s)]
*  Not surprisingly, the Ukrainian president, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky, is on board with this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=178.86s)]
*  Why wouldn't he be? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=180.38s)]
*  He's asked Joe Biden for an American enforced no-fly zone. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=181.94s)]
*  But as we said, many in Congress are for it too. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=185.22s)]
*  Here's Adam Kinzinger. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=187.66s)]
*  I think this is time where we need to, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=189.38s)]
*  at the invitation of Ukraine, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=191.54000000000002s)]
*  declare Ukraine a no-fly zone enforced by NATO [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=193.74s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=196.9s)]
*  We certainly have the capability to do that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=197.78s)]
*  The airspace is still contested by the Ukrainians. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=200.3s)]
*  We could certainly shut down Russian air operations, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=204.34s)]
*  even if we don't directly engage Russian troops [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=207.02s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=209.86s)]
*  We can shut down Russian air operations, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=211.94s)]
*  even if we don't directly engage Russian troops [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=214.56s)]
*  on the ground. So that's a lie. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=217.18s)]
*  It's hard to overstate how dishonest Kinzinger's claim is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  Shooting down Russian planes [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=221.74s)]
*  and taking out radar installations [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  would, by definition, entail engaging Russian troops. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=224.34s)]
*  If Vladimir Putin is even half as evil and crazy [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=228.98s)]
*  as they tell us he is, and he may be, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=231.78s)]
*  that could easily spiral into nuclear conflict. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=234.06s)]
*  So you would only suggest that if you had nothing to lose. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=238.42s)]
*  And Adam Kinzinger, of course, doesn't. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=242.26s)]
*  His political career is over. He's disgraced. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  He has literally nothing to lose. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  But many of us have a lot to lose. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  Our country, we have children. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=249.14s)]
*  So we should pause before we do that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=251.54s)]
*  But no pausing allowed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=253.48s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger thinks you're a traitor [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=255.1s)]
*  if you're worried about where this might go. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=256.94s)]
*  This breathlessness over nukes is mind-blowing, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=259.41999999999996s)]
*  Kinzinger wrote over the weekend. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=262.17999999999995s)]
*  Nothing bad will happen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=263.46s)]
*  And maybe nothing bad will happen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=265.9s)]
*  But something very bad could happen, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=268.28s)]
*  and it could happen fast. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=270.06s)]
*  Adults know that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=271.94s)]
*  Anyone with the experience knows that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=272.9s)]
*  Watch any war in history. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  And yet tonight, amazingly, some of those adults, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=277.02s)]
*  and they are adults, favor this anyway. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=279.29999999999995s)]
*  Two former Supreme Allied commanders of NATO, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  Wes Clark and Philip Breedlove, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=284.5s)]
*  are pushing for armed confrontation [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=286.14s)]
*  with the Russian military. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=287.98s)]
*  In an interview with Foreign Policy magazine, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=289.66s)]
*  Breedlove was honest enough to acknowledge [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=291.54s)]
*  that a no-fly zone would amount to, quote, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  an act of war, and it would. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=295.38s)]
*  Thank you for saying so out loud. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  But Breedlove said, he's for it anyway. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=299.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  So this is the moment when a functioning news media [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=304.1s)]
*  would step in and start to ask basic questions [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=306.58000000000004s)]
*  about what happens next. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=308.82s)]
*  War with Russia, fine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  What does that mean exactly? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=311.42s)]
*  How far is the United States and its population [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=313.44s)]
*  who would fight that war prepared to take this conflict, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=316.08s)]
*  and to what end? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  Once we start bombing Russia, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  will Putin withdraw his forces from Ukraine? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=322.96s)]
*  What will be left of Ukraine by that point? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  How are we sure that Putin, who we say is deranged, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=328.56s)]
*  won't go nuclear if a war with him begins? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=331.68s)]
*  And then, among many other questions, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=334.88s)]
*  what will China's role in this war be? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=337.08s)]
*  Thanks to the efforts of the Biden White House, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  China is now Vladimir Putin's strongest ally. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=341.68s)]
*  The Chinese have decided a long-term energy deal with Russia. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=344.64s)]
*  They now have skin in the game. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=347.8s)]
*  Russia will be powering China's economy going forward. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=349.36s)]
*  Good job, Biden White House. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=353.76s)]
*  But because that's true, how sure are we [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=355.84s)]
*  that the Chinese will stay out of a war? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=358.36s)]
*  How do we know they won't take down our digital infrastructure, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=361.2s)]
*  which they seem to some great extent to control in this country? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=363.44s)]
*  Et cetera, et cetera. You can think of many questions. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=366.68s)]
*  But reporters aren't asking any of them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=369.38s)]
*  Asking questions is now immoral. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  Richard Engel, who knows better, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=373.44s)]
*  he's the chief foreign correspondent at NBC, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=375.08s)]
*  is now demanding that American troops fight the Russian army. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=377.32s)]
*  It's a moral imperative. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=380.44s)]
*  A massive Russian convoy is about 30 miles from Kiev. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=382.16s)]
*  The US slash NATO could likely destroy it, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=385.48s)]
*  but that would be direct involvement against Russia [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=387.52s)]
*  and risk everything. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=389.76s)]
*  Does the West watch in silence as it rolls? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=391.24s)]
*  And, of course, the answer is implied. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=394.52s)]
*  We can't watch in silence. That would be immoral. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=395.96s)]
*  If you're a good person, you will support a war [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=398.96s)]
*  that could very easily turn into a nuclear conflict. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=401.4s)]
*  Again, this is moral blackmail. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=405.4s)]
*  No one in America takes pride at the site, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=406.96s)]
*  feels anything but revulsion at the site [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=410.28s)]
*  of Russian troops within Ukraine. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=412.76s)]
*  It's wrong. It's destabilizing to the world. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  It is, in fact, against our values. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=417.64s)]
*  But how we respond is the question. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  Thoughtfully has to be the answer [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=423.44s)]
*  unless we're prepared to risk massive consequences. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=425.32s)]
*  Now, Richard Haass, who's the president [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=428.56s)]
*  of the Council on Foreign Relations, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=430.28s)]
*  would, under normal circumstances, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=431.56s)]
*  be exactly the man you would go to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=433.2s)]
*  for a wise and reasoned perspective on what to do next. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=435.08s)]
*  That's his job. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=438.96s)]
*  Whatever you think of the Council on Foreign Relations, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  and we don't think much, they're not a radical organization. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=442.68s)]
*  Their job is to think through the consequences of action. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=446.08s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=449.84s)]
*  Richard Haass is foursquare in favor [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  of a hot war with Russia. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=453.96s)]
*  He's calling for, quote, regime change in Moscow, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=455.64s)]
*  because no doubt they'll greet us as liberators. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=458.8s)]
*  What could go wrong? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=460.8s)]
*  Here's Richard Haass. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  We need now a responsive necessity to his war of choice. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=464.2s)]
*  And there's gotta be to raise the economic costs at home, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=468.48s)]
*  to raise the military costs on the ground. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=471.6s)]
*  I hate to be so blunt, but the most vulnerable thing [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=474.16s)]
*  that Putin's vulnerable to is dead Russian soldiers. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  So we have to make sure Ukraine has the means to resist. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=481.36s)]
*  When did a guy that irresponsible [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=485.84s)]
*  take over the Council on Foreign Relations? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=489.2s)]
*  And of course, that's not his real job, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=491.08s)]
*  the Council on Foreign Relations. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=493.12s)]
*  His real job is being a cable news pundit. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=494.28s)]
*  And that's kind of the problem with the level of discourse [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=496.76s)]
*  around this war. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=499.48s)]
*  The problem is that when real people [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=500.6s)]
*  with jobs that convey actual authority [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=503.36s)]
*  start talking like cable news guests, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=506.2s)]
*  things could go sideways very fast. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=508.28s)]
*  Dead Russian soldiers. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=510.28s)]
*  So it's hardly a defense of Vladimir Putin [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=512.2s)]
*  to point out once again that a shooting war with Russia [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=514.12s)]
*  could have massive consequences for us. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=517.44s)]
*  Because it's not just Russian soldiers who would die. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=521.0s)]
*  Americans would die too, potentially. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=524.0s)]
*  Many of them. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=526.64s)]
*  And by the way, it's not all certain we would win that war. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=528.24s)]
*  Sorry, it's not. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=530.28s)]
*  Ask anyone who's familiar with the current state [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=531.36s)]
*  of readiness of the US military. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=533.0s)]
*  Is victory a foregone conclusion? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=536.36s)]
*  Is this the roll into Baghdad? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=539.2s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=541.36s)]
*  This is not Saddam Hussein we're talking about. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=542.92s)]
*  So again, the point is, are we ready for all of this? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=545.4s)]
*  We're moving down a path that could result [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=548.92s)]
*  in the destruction of the United States. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=551.0799999999999s)]
*  Americans may be mad at Putin, understandably, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=553.4s)]
*  but they're wary of where our leaders are taking this next. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=556.16s)]
*  A new CNN poll, for example, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=559.56s)]
*  shows a strong majority of Americans, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=560.92s)]
*  speaking of democracy, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=563.04s)]
*  opposes direct military action against Russia. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=564.4799999999999s)]
*  Are they all traitors? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  Are they all pro-Putin? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=568.28s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  At the very least, they would like, and we could use, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=571.72s)]
*  a sober national conversation about the potential consequences [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=574.4s)]
*  of where people like Richard Haass are taking us now. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=578.4s)]
*  That's the opposite of what we're getting. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=581.88s)]
*  Instead, we're getting buffoons like Adam Kinzinger [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=583.5600000000001s)]
*  sitting in his office, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=585.88s)]
*  making bellicose noises on social media. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  Just the other day, Kinzinger posted images on Twitter [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=589.12s)]
*  of a Ukrainian air ace called the Ghost of Kiev. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=591.6s)]
*  He downed Russian Migs left and right. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=594.72s)]
*  Well, it turns out the whole thing was a hoax, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=597.48s)]
*  but of course, Adam Kinzinger had no idea [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=599.08s)]
*  because he knows nothing. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=600.72s)]
*  The Ghost of Kiev has a name [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=602.0400000000001s)]
*  and he has absolutely owned the Russian Air Force, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=603.6s)]
*  he tweeted. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=606.36s)]
*  Imagine a sitting member of Congress [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=607.2s)]
*  tweeting about a war like it's a cable news segment. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  He absolutely owned the Russian Air Force. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=611.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=613.2s)]
*  Get some respect. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=614.72s)]
*  People are dying, buffoon. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=615.72s)]
*  Kinzinger then attached an obviously photoshopped image [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=619.08s)]
*  of the comedian Sam Hyde [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=621.64s)]
*  sitting in the cockpit of a fighter jet. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=622.96s)]
*  Sam Hyde, for the record, is not a Ukrainian fighter ace. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=624.52s)]
*  He is once again a comedian. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=627.36s)]
*  That was Adam Kinzinger. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=629.84s)]
*  These are the people pushing us toward a new world war. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=630.84s)]
*  So at the very least, let's pause and think this through. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=633.28s)]
*  That seems fair. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=636.84s)]
*  And as we do that, it is also worth considering [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=637.68s)]
*  what's happening here in the United States [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=640.0s)]
*  concurrent with this war and justified by this war. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=641.56s)]
*  And by that, we are speaking of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=644.36s)]
*  the assault on civil liberties now underway. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=646.08s)]
*  It would be ironic if a defense of democracy [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=649.04s)]
*  on the other side of the world [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=652.72s)]
*  led to an erosion of democracy here. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=654.08s)]
*  And yet that seems to be where we're heading. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=657.68s)]
*  You'll notice that the moment that Russian troops [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=660.12s)]
*  rolled across the border into Ukraine, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  Democrats wasted no time in attacking not just Putin, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=664.56s)]
*  but there are political opponents in this country. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=667.6s)]
*  What did they have to do with it? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=671.4s)]
*  Isn't war the moment for unity? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  We're all in this together. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=674.76s)]
*  But they leveraged this war and the human suffering [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  that it inevitably entails to make partisan points. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=678.6s)]
*  One MSNBC regular, in one of the stranger moments [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=683.24s)]
*  you'll see on television, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=685.72s)]
*  and the MSNBC has had a lot of those recently, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=686.5999999999999s)]
*  said the whole conflict was the result of a plot [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=688.76s)]
*  engineered by Vladimir Putin's mole [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=692.2399999999999s)]
*  who happened to be the former president of the United States. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=694.9599999999999s)]
*  Trump was installed as the president of the United States [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=698.16s)]
*  in order to weaken the alliances [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=701.68s)]
*  that were preventing Putin from achieving his goals. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=704.4799999999999s)]
*  Alliances like NATO, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=707.28s)]
*  our relationship with our European partners, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=709.04s)]
*  our relationship with Ukraine. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=711.4s)]
*  Trump was put in as a bulldozer. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=713.48s)]
*  Okay, so we spent maybe three years holding up [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=717.88s)]
*  the lunacy of the Russiagate people and the lying [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=723.32s)]
*  as evidence that maybe they shouldn't have [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=727.32s)]
*  a meaningful effect on our national conversation [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=729.64s)]
*  about politics. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  And yet somehow, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=733.28s)]
*  through a very unfortunate confluence of events, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=735.32s)]
*  those very same unbalanced people [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=737.48s)]
*  are now having a measurable effect on our foreign policy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=739.6s)]
*  And if you think we're overstating the lunacy, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=743.16s)]
*  try to follow the logic here. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=744.64s)]
*  This is what she just told us. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=745.92s)]
*  So Donald Trump, that would be Putin's man [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=747.16s)]
*  in the White House, tells Europe [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=748.5600000000001s)]
*  not to become dependent upon Russian oil, as he did, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=749.72s)]
*  and to pay more for their own military defense, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=752.48s)]
*  which he also did and was scoffed at, by the way. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=754.32s)]
*  And yet for some reason, Putin then waits to invade Ukraine [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=757.16s)]
*  until his man in the White House [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=760.6s)]
*  is gone and playing golf in Florida. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=762.04s)]
*  And now it is Donald Trump's fault [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=764.16s)]
*  that Europe is dependent on Russia for energy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=765.68s)]
*  It was all part of Putin's plan. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=768.4s)]
*  Republicans wanted this to happen all along. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=770.56s)]
*  You can imagine MSNBC viewers, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=773.1199999999999s)]
*  the one who sat through years of this, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=774.92s)]
*  nodding along, yes, now the P-tape makes sense. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=776.52s)]
*  What's scary about this is that it's not confined to MSNBC. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=781.3599999999999s)]
*  The overlap between MSNBC guests [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  shouting nonsensical partisan talking points [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=788.1199999999999s)]
*  and true conspiracy theories [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=791.16s)]
*  and Democratic policymakers is profound. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=792.88s)]
*  So Democratic lawmakers are now pretending [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=795.92s)]
*  there is a large and dangerous fifth column [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=797.5999999999999s)]
*  in the United States working for Vladimir Putin, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=799.84s)]
*  which there is not. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=801.8000000000001s)]
*  And as always, they're talking about themselves. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=804.4s)]
*  Eric Swalwell, for example, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=806.2s)]
*  he recently took the maximum possible campaign donation [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=807.2800000000001s)]
*  from a lobbyist for Nord Stream to AG. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=810.6s)]
*  Now that's the company making the pipeline [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=813.44s)]
*  that will give Russia greater control [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=815.72s)]
*  over Europe's energy grid [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=817.48s)]
*  and from which the Russian government profits. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=818.72s)]
*  So Eric Swalwell is taking money from the Russians. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=822.32s)]
*  And by the way, this is a guy who had sex [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=827.36s)]
*  with a Chinese spy. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=828.84s)]
*  Has he had sex with Russian spies? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=830.84s)]
*  But you'll notice the one guy [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=831.84s)]
*  who probably shouldn't be calling other people traitors [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=833.32s)]
*  as he takes money from Russian energy interests [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  is whipping around and accusing everyone else [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=839.2s)]
*  of rooting for the Russians. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=841.4s)]
*  Watch. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=842.88s)]
*  We have Republicans who are rooting for Russia. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=844.24s)]
*  And that makes it very hard for President Biden [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=847.12s)]
*  to get the whole country to go along [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=849.0s)]
*  when Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo, and Tucker Carlson [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=850.88s)]
*  are rooting for Russians. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=853.64s)]
*  And that's being replayed on Russia TV [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=854.96s)]
*  to rally Russians for this cause. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=857.72s)]
*  You know, it's such an awful thing to say. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=861.8000000000001s)]
*  We hesitated even to play that. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=863.9200000000001s)]
*  It's very common. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=866.12s)]
*  You hear it every day. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=866.96s)]
*  The question is, why are they saying that? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=868.64s)]
*  It doesn't make sense, but it makes political sense. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=870.48s)]
*  It is an effort to cover their own tracks. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=874.24s)]
*  Our foreign policy establishment [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=876.48s)]
*  failed to constrain Vladimir Putin. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=878.0400000000001s)]
*  To bring you back to ancient history, like a week ago, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  they were telling us that sanctions [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=883.84s)]
*  and arming the Ukrainian military [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=885.72s)]
*  would prevent a Russian invasion. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=887.72s)]
*  Now, they were wrong about that. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=889.88s)]
*  They've been wrong many times, most recently in Afghanistan. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=891.0400000000001s)]
*  And in fact, now that we're casting blame, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=894.6800000000001s)]
*  if there was any single American who deserves scorn [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=896.9200000000001s)]
*  and, yes, blame for the invasion of Ukraine, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=900.76s)]
*  it would be Joe Biden. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=902.76s)]
*  Of course, it was his job, self-described job, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=904.2s)]
*  to prevent it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=908.2s)]
*  But of course, they won't admit that. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=910.6s)]
*  Instead, they're attacking you, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=911.72s)]
*  and they're doing it with partisan goals in mind. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=912.96s)]
*  Democrats plan to use the Ukraine invasion. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=914.8s)]
*  This has become very obvious in the last three days. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=916.88s)]
*  In the very same way they used January 6th. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=919.52s)]
*  So bad event takes place. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=923.0799999999999s)]
*  No one really is for it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=925.12s)]
*  No one defended the riot on January 6th. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=926.9599999999999s)]
*  We certainly didn't. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=929.7199999999999s)]
*  But history is written immediately for partisan ends. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=932.0s)]
*  So then you take the hysteria ginned up over that event, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=935.88s)]
*  some of it legitimate, by the way. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=938.8s)]
*  People have a right to be upset. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=940.16s)]
*  And you use that to purge the country [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=942.16s)]
*  of the Democratic Party's political opponents. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=944.7199999999999s)]
*  So what do they really hate? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=947.16s)]
*  Well, listen to them. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=948.28s)]
*  They hate populist politics. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=949.28s)]
*  They hate populist politics in this country [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=951.52s)]
*  far more than they hate Vladimir Putin. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=953.0s)]
*  So they're using this opportunity, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=955.6s)]
*  this war in Eastern Europe, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  to shut down domestic dissent in the United States. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=958.88s)]
*  And you're seeing it, as always, in our allies first. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=962.68s)]
*  Several of them, including Canada, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=964.9599999999999s)]
*  have banned journalists who don't agree [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=966.56s)]
*  with their view of the war. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=968.64s)]
*  Again, if we're gonna protect democracy, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=971.24s)]
*  that should start at home. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=973.5600000000001s)]
*  And democracy is defined, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=975.16s)]
*  literally defined by the tolerance of the regime for dissent. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=977.08s)]
*  But no dissent is allowed. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=981.48s)]
*  So they've pulled RT off the airwaves in Canada. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  We did that long ago. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=986.28s)]
*  And that led Mother Jones Magazine [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=987.28s)]
*  to ask this question today. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=988.84s)]
*  Both RT and Sputnik air the United States to, untrue, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=990.48s)]
*  but whatever, they don't know. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=993.2s)]
*  Will Biden follow suit and crack down [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=994.48s)]
*  on pro-Russia disinformation? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=996.64s)]
*  If he does, US cable companies will also need [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=998.2s)]
*  to scrutinize media outlets like Fox News, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1000.28s)]
*  who shows Tucker Carlson in particular, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1002.92s)]
*  have parroted pro-Russia talking points. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1004.56s)]
*  Okay, so Putin invades Ukraine, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1006.92s)]
*  self-evidently a tragedy, bad for the United States, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  and we're using that as a justification, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1012.0s)]
*  because we care so much about democracy, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1013.8399999999999s)]
*  to shut down any news organization, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1015.92s)]
*  any journalist who questions the Democratic Party. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1019.12s)]
*  Okay, how do we get here anyway? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1023.9599999999999s)]
*  How corroded have these people become? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1026.56s)]
*  That they're calling for government censorship of dissent [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1029.88s)]
*  and telling us they're defenders of democracy. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1033.84s)]
*  That's just the beginning. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1035.64s)]
*  And who supports voter ID laws is a Kremlin agent too. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1036.92s)]
*  You seeing how they're gonna use this? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1040.04s)]
*  Here's Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Lee to explain. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1041.4s)]
*  We talked about the fact that the invasion, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1044.88s)]
*  the assault on Ukraine was an assault on democracy. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1047.64s)]
*  Barbara took the time to talk about assaults [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1051.16s)]
*  on our democracy in our own country. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1054.8s)]
*  The fight for democracy is taking place [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1057.16s)]
*  throughout the world. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1060.2s)]
*  It's not only in Ukraine, but it's in our own country. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1061.0400000000002s)]
*  And we've seen this through the campaigns [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1064.64s)]
*  of misinformation and disinformation. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1066.8000000000002s)]
*  We see this happening in Ukraine. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1068.88s)]
*  The fact that now we see those at times [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1071.68s)]
*  to take away the voting rights of people of color, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1075.3200000000002s)]
*  of African-Americans, of young people, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1078.52s)]
*  of seniors, of the disabled. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1080.52s)]
*  You know, it's not even worth parsing the logic [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1084.0800000000002s)]
*  of something like that. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1086.8s)]
*  You can only feel deep sadness [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1087.84s)]
*  that the people you just saw represent you [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1089.6s)]
*  in our legislature. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1092.1599999999999s)]
*  But by the way, as long as we're punishing people [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1094.44s)]
*  who are allied with hostile foreign interests, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1096.52s)]
*  just to restate the obvious, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1099.24s)]
*  China is now Russia's strongest ally in this war. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1100.56s)]
*  And that has real implications for people like, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1105.32s)]
*  I don't know, Nancy Pelosi, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1107.36s)]
*  whose family has gotten rich from China, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1109.12s)]
*  or the entire American finance sector. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1111.0s)]
*  Same, or Hollywood, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1113.2s)]
*  or all the people who are now profiting [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1114.8s)]
*  from Vladimir Putin's closest ally. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1117.08s)]
*  Will they divest of those investments? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1119.56s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1121.9199999999998s)]
*  But in the meantime, you should be very aware [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1123.12s)]
*  that there are partisan forces trying to use [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1125.12s)]
*  the war on Ukraine to accomplish political objectives [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1127.2s)]
*  here domestically and gain more power for themselves. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1130.68s)]
*  It's not just about voting rights [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1133.36s)]
*  or shutting down Fox News. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1134.6s)]
*  It's about shutting you up personally, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1135.9199999999998s)]
*  your ability to express yourself. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1138.32s)]
*  And if you doubt that, you should know [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1140.1599999999999s)]
*  that Senator Mark Warner of Virginia [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1142.8s)]
*  just wrote a letter to his donors, the tech monopolies, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1144.76s)]
*  demanding that they, quote, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1147.2s)]
*  restrict the spread of Russian propaganda. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1148.1599999999999s)]
*  He did not define the term Russian propaganda, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1151.12s)]
*  and as a show that has been accused of disseminating it, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1153.36s)]
*  repeatedly, we can tell you we're a little sensitive [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1155.76s)]
*  on the topic, and you should be too. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1158.6399999999999s)]
*  So Warner went on television recently, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1161.44s)]
*  report that his donors in big tech [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1163.3999999999999s)]
*  quickly complied with his demand. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1165.1599999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1167.12s)]
*  You sent letters on Friday [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1168.68s)]
*  to our leading social media companies, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1170.8s)]
*  Meta, which runs Facebook, Alphabet, Reddit, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1174.48s)]
*  asking them to take action to prevent Russian state media, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1177.84s)]
*  Russian propaganda operations [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1182.12s)]
*  from appearing on their platforms. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1184.76s)]
*  I wanna ask, have you received any responses yet [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  to your request that they take that action? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1190.12s)]
*  Well, David, the short answer is yes. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1193.56s)]
*  Virtually every one of these platforms [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1196.4s)]
*  has taken down some of the Russian activity [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1198.96s)]
*  or demonetized, so they're not making money off of RT [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1201.4s)]
*  or Russian ads on real time during the platforms. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1204.6000000000001s)]
*  That's good, I commend these platforms. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  So contrast that clip with the one from MSNBC [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1214.2s)]
*  we just played. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1216.8400000000001s)]
*  The first is when dumb people do propaganda [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1217.96s)]
*  and tell you that Russia invading Ukraine [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1220.3600000000001s)]
*  is somehow about racism in the American South or something. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1222.52s)]
*  I mean, it's nonsensical. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1225.0s)]
*  What you just saw is what happens when smart people [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1226.3200000000002s)]
*  do propaganda, the CIA shill on the left, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1228.68s)]
*  the Intel committee chairman on the right. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1233.28s)]
*  You'll notice that the CIA shill said [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1236.6000000000001s)]
*  Russian state media or Russian propaganda. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1238.88s)]
*  Just to be completely clear, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1241.6000000000001s)]
*  Warner is not talking about banning Russian state media. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1243.28s)]
*  He's talking about banning Russian propaganda, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1247.4s)]
*  a term that he gets to define. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1249.92s)]
*  He's talking about censoring the opinions of Americans. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1251.72s)]
*  Now, to be clear, that is not allowed in a democracy. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1254.72s)]
*  Citizens who rule have an absolute right [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1259.64s)]
*  to have any opinion they want, period. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1262.68s)]
*  That's not an ancillary freedom. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1266.1200000000001s)]
*  That's some random thing that we have [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1267.72s)]
*  as an added bonus as Americans. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1269.68s)]
*  That freedom of speech, freedom of conscience [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1273.3200000000002s)]
*  is the central freedom we have. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1275.5600000000002s)]
*  It's the whole point of the country. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1278.0400000000002s)]
*  And there is no point in supporting Ukraine [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1279.8000000000002s)]
*  if our leaders ignore our own bill of rights. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1282.76s)]
*  And we should demand that they respect our bill of rights [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1286.16s)]
*  before they take a single step forward [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1290.0800000000002s)]
*  in defense of any other democracy, period. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-SqVzg_2Q&t=1292.0800000000002s)]
