# Sports reporter's shocking reason for leaving NBC
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE)
*  So for a decade, Michelle Tufoya was a highly recognizable reporter for NBC Sports. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=0.0s)]
*  She covered hundreds of NFL games as a sideline reporter, including five Super Bowls. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=4.72s)]
*  She worked at multiple Olympics. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=9.22s)]
*  Doubtless you've seen some of her interviews over the years. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=11.24s)]
*  Here's a sampler, including her coverage of the Super Bowl this past Sunday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Erin, obviously emotional. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=17.84s)]
*  What's the immediate feeling you've got right now? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=27.0s)]
*  I feel so happy. I wanted this so bad. I dreamed this, man. I dreamed this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=30.0s)]
*  And it's like, it's surreal. Look at this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=36.0s)]
*  Michelle Tufoya retiring from sports casting. Michelle, we love you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=39.0s)]
*  You have been so much fun. And we'll hear a lot more from her. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=43.0s)]
*  You and I know what the future holds, pal. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=47.0s)]
*  So that was Sunday. This is Wednesday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=50.0s)]
*  Michelle Tufoya has been in the industry for nearly 30 years covering sports. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=53.0s)]
*  Michelle Tufoya has decided to step away from NBC Sports. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=56.0s)]
*  She said she made the decision wholly on her own. She was not forced out. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=60.0s)]
*  And she's doing it because she wants to be in a role where she can speak openly. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=63.0s)]
*  There's nothing we're in favor of more than that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=68.0s)]
*  We're honored to have Michelle Tufoya join us tonight to explain. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=70.0s)]
*  Michelle, first of all, congratulations on this new chapter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=73.0s)]
*  What an interesting decision that you made. Why did you make it? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=76.0s)]
*  It's been on my mind for quite a while, Tucker. Thank you for having me. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=81.0s)]
*  And no, NBC did not encourage this. They did not force this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=84.0s)]
*  This has been on my mind. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=88.0s)]
*  I've been waking up every day with a palpable pull at my gut that my side, my view, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=90.0s)]
*  my middle ground kind of moderate viewpoint is not being represented to the rest of the world, I didn't feel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=101.0s)]
*  And so rather than just banging it out on Twitter or Instagram every day, I thought, I've got to do something. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=109.0s)]
*  I have benefited greatly from the American dream. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=118.0s)]
*  And I feel like for the sake of my kids and because I so love this country, I've got to start giving back. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=121.0s)]
*  Boy, that is the best possible reason. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=129.0s)]
*  So people who watch sports, of course, know you and have for many years. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=132.0s)]
*  You went on The View recently, which is a slightly different venue for you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=137.0s)]
*  We have a short clip, and I want to ask if this had some role in your decision. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=142.0s)]
*  Here it is. My kids in school. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=146.0s)]
*  There is a big, big focus on the color of your skin. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=149.0s)]
*  And my children, my children are now 16 and 13. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=152.0s)]
*  Okay, it's been going on since they were in lower school. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=156.0s)]
*  All right. And it is that there are affinity groups on campus for my son's first best friend was a kid. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=160.0s)]
*  My son's first best friend was a little African American boy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=166.0s)]
*  They were inseparable. Get to a certain age. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=169.0s)]
*  They start having what's called an affinity group, which means you go for lunch and pizza with people who look like you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=172.0s)]
*  Suddenly, my son wasn't hanging out with him anymore. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=178.0s)]
*  Why are we even teaching that the color of the skin matters? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=181.0s)]
*  Because to me, what matters is your character and your values. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=185.0s)]
*  Yes, but you know you live in the United States. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=188.0s)]
*  You know that color of skin has been mattering to people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=190.0s)]
*  We change it that it doesn't. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=194.0s)]
*  We need white people to step up and do that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=196.0s)]
*  But I think that they've been doing that since the Civil War. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=198.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying it's perfect. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=201.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=203.0s)]
*  Wow, that was such a such a moderate thing to say, such a sensible thing to say. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=204.0s)]
*  And yet it seemed like such a controversial thing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=209.0s)]
*  I thought that was really brave that you said that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=212.0s)]
*  What did you think of the reaction? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=214.0s)]
*  I'm just astonished that we're we're so looking in the rearview mirror and not absorbing the progress that we've made in this country and building on it and recognizing it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=217.0s)]
*  You know, I don't think a person like whoopi Goldberg would have had that role 50 years ago. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=230.0s)]
*  She has that now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=236.0s)]
*  I mean, that you and I know, Tucker, we could come up with a million examples. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=237.0s)]
*  And it breaks my heart that my kids are being taught that skin color matters. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=243.0s)]
*  And to me, if you want white people to step up, I was stepping up when I addressed the school and said, why are we having these picnics for families of color? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=250.0s)]
*  Why are we separating our kids? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=260.0s)]
*  If the world is integrated, let's continue that and have everyone find out what we all have in common, not just what we have in common with people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=263.0s)]
*  What we have in common with people who look like us. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=272.0s)]
*  Man, you know, I would I bet you 20 bucks that 95 percent of Americans agree with what you just said. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=275.0s)]
*  And but to say that when you work at NBC Sports or any big media company really takes I mean, you must have known that you would be attacked for defending the American ideal as you did. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=281.0s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=294.0s)]
*  Because I don't care if I'm attacked. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=296.0s)]
*  I really am not afraid of that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=299.0s)]
*  And I guess I feel like so many people now are afraid. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=301.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm not. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=305.0s)]
*  Listen, I know there are repercussions for whatever I choose to say. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=308.0s)]
*  And I've talked to my kids school about it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=312.0s)]
*  You know, please don't hold this against my kids. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=315.0s)]
*  I'm speaking for me. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=317.0s)]
*  I'm speaking for my family. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=318.0s)]
*  But please don't hold this against my kids. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=320.0s)]
*  But this is what I really believe. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=322.0s)]
*  I think I speak for a lot of people, like you said, Tucker. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=324.0s)]
*  And a lot of these people, my friends, are afraid to repost things that I've posted or, you know, get into political conversations. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=326.0s)]
*  They are. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=335.0s)]
*  And they've said it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=336.0s)]
*  I'm afraid I don't want to get in these arguments with my friends, with my boss, with my colleagues. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=337.0s)]
*  This is the most terrifying thing in the world to me right now that people are afraid to talk. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=343.0s)]
*  These are words coming out of our mouths. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=350.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=352.0s)]
*  We could probably hurt people with our words. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=353.0s)]
*  I acknowledge that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=355.0s)]
*  But I get to choose my reaction to everybody's words. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=356.0s)]
*  And everybody else gets to choose their reaction to my words. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=359.0s)]
*  So they can choose to react to what I say. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=362.0s)]
*  I'm going to choose to say what I believe and what I feel very strongly about. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=365.0s)]
*  And I'm going to continue this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=369.0s)]
*  And this is the direction I'm headed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=371.0s)]
*  I just love it so much. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=375.0s)]
*  And I think personal bravery, like the kind that you have displayed and are displaying now, is deeply inspiring to people and comforting. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=376.0s)]
*  And really is the answer to where we are. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=384.0s)]
*  So thank you for what you're doing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=386.0s)]
*  I hope people will join me. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=388.0s)]
*  I hope people will join me, Tucker. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=389.0s)]
*  Well, if you keep doing it, people will. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=392.0s)]
*  So that's why it's so great to see you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=393.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZnAR82cXE&t=395.0s)]
