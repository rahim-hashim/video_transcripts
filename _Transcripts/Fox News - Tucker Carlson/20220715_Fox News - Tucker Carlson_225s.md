# Norwegian feminist faces jail time in Norway for 'stating the obvious'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE)
*  So it is quickly becoming illegal to point out that men are not women, no matter how they dress, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=0.0s)]
*  no matter what kind of shoes they have, no matter what they paint their nails. So this is an attack [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=4.96s)]
*  not just on biology but on speech, on conscience. You're not allowed to say obvious things. Here's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=10.32s)]
*  an example. A self-described feminist in Norway called Kristina Ellingsen is facing a three-year [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=18.16s)]
*  sentence in prison. She's facing the possibility of going to jail for years because she affirmed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=23.44s)]
*  the reality of biological sex specifically. Ellingsen tweeted that men cannot be lesbians. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=29.44s)]
*  Probably never thought about this in any depth but it's technically true. She also said that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=35.36s)]
*  men cannot become mothers. Now again that's true but in Norway as in all of the west the truth is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=39.2s)]
*  no longer a defense. Norway is now investigating her for hate speech. We of course immediately [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=46.24s)]
*  wanted to talk to her. Kristina Ellingsen joins us tonight. Kristina thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  This is one of those stories. Norway is obviously a highly civilized country. I think it's the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=55.36s)]
*  richest country in the world. A lot of great people in Norway. It's hard to believe this is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=59.52s)]
*  real and I just want to check. Are we leaving anything out? No that's right. This is the case. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=63.52s)]
*  I've been well you can't defend women if you can't define what a woman is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=71.76s)]
*  And all over the world stating biological facts is considered by a lot of groups [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=78.08s)]
*  as being directly hateful. So yeah this is what I've been doing. I've been stating the obvious [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=84.8s)]
*  fact that men cannot be women. Men cannot be girls or mothers or lesbian and now I'm facing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=92.16s)]
*  the risk of three years in prison. Tell me how the country of Norway again a country to which [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=100.64s)]
*  we give every benefit of every doubt filled with good people beautiful place but are you celebrated [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=107.84s)]
*  as a hero by people who still believe in science and free speech? Are people supporting you? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=113.12s)]
*  Well a lot of people are supporting me across the entire spectrum of political religious everything [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=120.64s)]
*  but a lot of people are also considering me on level with someone who's calling for genocide. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=128.32s)]
*  I've been compared to and it's everything from a fascist to a Maoist to a supporter of Westboro [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=135.76s)]
*  Baptist Church which I don't even know what is but basically on the entire spectrum of everything [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=143.36s)]
*  that's bad in the world is being hurled my way absolutely but also a lot of support. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=151.84s)]
*  I think you're on I'm just guessing but I think you're on the left. I don't think you're a right [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=158.32s)]
*  winger. I think you're from Norway. Are you surprised by all of this? Unfortunately I'm not [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=166.0s)]
*  surprised because this has been in the cards for a long time. If you can't talk about biological [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=173.04s)]
*  reality it's unavoidable. This is simply unavoidable but yeah no I align myself with [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=178.4s)]
*  radical feminism. I've been voting left all my life. Now I'm much more critical to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  what they are actually saying and it seems like but it seems like all parties in Norway [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=199.28s)]
*  are supporting this pseudoscience. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=204.0s)]
*  Scary. We know the feeling. Thank you for joining us tonight Kristine Ellington. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopMFfMlwvE&t=209.12s)]
