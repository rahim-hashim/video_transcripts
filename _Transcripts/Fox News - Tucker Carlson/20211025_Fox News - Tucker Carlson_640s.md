# Tucker: Because of Joe Biden, it's that simple
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg)
*  It's a disaster and it's hard to believe as you watch that tape that not so long ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=0.0s)]
*  this country actually enforced its immigration laws. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=4.62s)]
*  Not long ago at all. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=6.8s)]
*  In fact, just two years ago, in August of 2019, federal agents kicked down the doors [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=7.8s)]
*  of seven separate chicken plants in central Mississippi. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=12.24s)]
*  They arrested hundreds of foreign nationals who were living and working there in violation [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=15.84s)]
*  of American law. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=19.64s)]
*  Several executives of the poultry plant were later indicted. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=20.92s)]
*  Among the charges brought, child labor. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=23.48s)]
*  So our decadent corporate press essentially ignored this except to portray the raids [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=27.48s)]
*  as heartless and barbaric. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Not surprisingly, a trade group called the National Chicken Council agreed with that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=33.16s)]
*  characterization. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=36.68s)]
*  How dare the government enforce its own laws? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=37.72s)]
*  What's interesting is that people who actually live in central Mississippi had a very different [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=40.8s)]
*  view of what happened. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=44.2s)]
*  They'd spent years watching helplessly as foreign workers lowered the wages for people [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=45.68s)]
*  who were actually born there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=49.84s)]
*  They understood immigration as most wage earners do understand immigration, primarily as an [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=51.66s)]
*  economic question. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=56.48s)]
*  When you flood the labor pool, wages go down. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=58.26s)]
*  That's called supply and demand. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  Once the illegal workers were gone, those chicken plants were forced to hire American [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=63.0s)]
*  citizens. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=66.44s)]
*  In this case, many of them were African American. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=67.44s)]
*  So you'd think maybe the Biden administration, with its much repeated commitment to equity, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=68.44s)]
*  would think this is good. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=74.36s)]
*  But of course, they didn't care. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=75.36s)]
*  They're not interested in helping working class people of any color. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=76.36s)]
*  Diversity consultants, Princeton professors, MSNBC contributors, transhumanist tech billionaires. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=79.84s)]
*  Of course, those are their people. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=85.56s)]
*  That's their main constituency. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=87.04s)]
*  But blue collar high school graduates who just want a decent hourly job? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  No chance. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  Not interested. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  So the administration promptly shut down all workplace immigration rates. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Now employers who hire illegal aliens in order to undercut American wages have the full protection [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=99.44s)]
*  of the Department of Homeland Security because it's not a corporate conspiracy or anything. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  Don't you worry. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=109.44s)]
*  Now, the rest of the world is fully aware of this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=110.44s)]
*  They follow these developments. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  They have the internet too. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=113.94s)]
*  As a result, as you just heard Bill Mollugian say, a massive migrant caravan has formed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=115.86s)]
*  in southeastern Mexico in the city of Tapachula. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  We want to show even more footage of that, which you did not see in Bill's report. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=123.34s)]
*  You can see the caravan is heading here and smashing through police barricades as it does. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=127.32s)]
*  Everybody sympathizes with migrants who want a better life in this country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=143.94s)]
*  Of course, our government's primary concern always must be the welfare of American citizens [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=172.82s)]
*  in a country that's rapidly getting poorer, which we are. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=178.42s)]
*  But in general, you sympathize. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  But migrants who violently break through a police line? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=186.9s)]
*  Not allowed here ever. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=187.9s)]
*  There's no possible way the U.S. benefits from anyone who would do that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=189.26s)]
*  Period. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=192.7s)]
*  And by the way, in contrast to previous years, these migrants are not coming exclusively [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=193.7s)]
*  from Latin America. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  They're coming from as far away as China. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  And again, why wouldn't they come? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=201.62s)]
*  The border is now open for everyone. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=203.18s)]
*  It's not just Central Americans. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  Fox's Drift Jenkins has been covering these caravans for years. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=206.66s)]
*  And this weekend he went to southwest Mexico and immediately saw something very different. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  We're in the town of Huehuetan, 16 miles north of Tapachula where this caravan started. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  You can see them, some children playing on a swing set. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=220.1s)]
*  But we're seeing a lot of families, a lot of children out here, and we're seeing migrants [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=223.74s)]
*  from many different countries, not just Central America, which was what was the situation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=228.78s)]
*  in 2019, that Northern Triangle of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=234.06s)]
*  But we see Haitians in here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=238.1s)]
*  We even met one woman from China that we couldn't speak to her because she didn't speak Spanish [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=239.58s)]
*  or English. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=243.94s)]
*  Every migrant we talked to today said they've got one destination in mind, and that's the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=244.94s)]
*  United States. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=249.3s)]
*  So why are they coming? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=251.62s)]
*  We don't need to guess about that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=252.62s)]
*  Ask the people who are coming here illegally. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=254.22s)]
*  They're not embarrassed to articulate it at all. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=256.46s)]
*  They're coming because they know immigration enforcement under Joe Biden has been suspended [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=259.34s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=264.28s)]
*  The White House hasn't simply ended workplace raids. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=265.85999999999996s)]
*  They've also stopped turning people away at the border so people just come in and they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=268.34s)]
*  know they'll never be forced to leave. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  Already the administration has released more than 160,000 illegal migrants into the country [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  with no supervision whatsoever without telling the people into whose neighborhoods they're [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  moving because they don't care what American citizens think. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=283.17999999999995s)]
*  By the way, how many are vaccinated? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=286.42s)]
*  You can't go to events. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  You can't have a job in this country without being vaccinated. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=290.02000000000004s)]
*  But if you come here illegally, no problem. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=292.42s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=294.22s)]
*  Now tens of thousands of those migrants, according to documents obtained by Fox News, have already [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=295.94s)]
*  received work permits. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=300.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=301.94s)]
*  Soon they will receive free benefits and the health care that Joe Biden has promised them. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=302.94s)]
*  That's why they're coming. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  Again, just ask them and they'll tell you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  Why now? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=310.26s)]
*  I think it's the best time. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=311.26s)]
*  The best time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=312.98s)]
*  Because of the administration? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=314.38s)]
*  Because of Joe Biden. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=315.38s)]
*  Because of Joe Biden. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=317.34s)]
*  Because of Joe Biden. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=319.74s)]
*  It's really that simple. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=321.18s)]
*  At the same time, you should know that Biden has ordered the government to build a wall [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=322.86s)]
*  around his family's vacation home in Delaware and build it at public expense. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=326.14s)]
*  Diversity may be our strength. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=331.34s)]
*  He often says that, but Joe Biden doesn't want it anywhere near him or his family. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=332.5s)]
*  Now the irony of that is almost difficult to digest. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=337.5s)]
*  It was just a year ago that Biden was telling us that walls are immoral and that's why he [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=339.5s)]
*  would never build a wall. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=343.46s)]
*  There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=345.82s)]
*  Oh, except around my vacation house in Delaware. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=350.41999999999996s)]
*  Hypocrite. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=355.34s)]
*  But it's more than hypocritical. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=356.78s)]
*  It's criminal and not in a rhetorical sense. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=358.7s)]
*  Joe Biden is actively and intentionally breaking federal law, even as he works to protect himself [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=361.5s)]
*  and his own family from the consequences of these lunatic policies. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=366.9s)]
*  Americans have been impeached for less than that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=371.62s)]
*  In fact, no American president who ever has been impeached, not Andrew Johnson, not Richard [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=373.82s)]
*  Nixon, not Bill Clinton, not even Donald Trump, has ever even been accused of crimes this [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  flagrant or this serious, not even close. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=382.66s)]
*  According to new court documents, between January 20th and the end of March, just for [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=387.22s)]
*  example, the Biden administration refused to take custody of 37 illegal immigrants in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=391.18s)]
*  the state of Texas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=395.94s)]
*  Many of these people had additional criminal records. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=396.94s)]
*  According to an affidavit from a Texas sheriff, the administration refused to detain even [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=399.38s)]
*  suspects believed to have committed aggravated sexual assault and narcotics violations at [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=403.5s)]
*  the height of a drug epidemic that's killing almost 100,000 Americans every year. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=409.42s)]
*  So it's really clear this is not simply an incredibly dangerous and destructive policy [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=414.94s)]
*  that intentionally hurts America. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=418.78s)]
*  And it is that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=420.38s)]
*  No, it's more though. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=421.5s)]
*  It's an unequivocal violation of federal statute. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=423.1s)]
*  It is, in other words, a crime. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=425.98s)]
*  It's a crime. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=427.62s)]
*  In 236C of the Immigration and Nationality Act requires federal agents to, quote, detain [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=429.22s)]
*  and hold any alien who is released from criminal custody if the alien entered illegally and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=435.58000000000004s)]
*  is removable on any of the criminal grounds of admissibility or if the alien entered legally [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=440.06s)]
*  and is removable on most all of the criminal deportation grounds. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  Got that? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  In other words, for the safety of American citizens, of course in every country has laws [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=450.46000000000004s)]
*  The U.S. government is required to arrest and hold criminal aliens and deport them. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=455.66s)]
*  But Joe Biden has refused to do that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=462.38000000000005s)]
*  He is breaking the law right out in the open. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=464.3s)]
*  So why hasn't he been impeached? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=468.82000000000005s)]
*  Not because he has bad character or he's senile, but because he is breaking federal law. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=471.90000000000003s)]
*  Not long ago, Joe Biden would have been impeached for that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=477.62s)]
*  American Democrats understood not so long ago that immigration law is fundamental to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=481.32s)]
*  any country. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=485.92s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=486.92s)]
*  It is an obligation as elected officials to keep the American people safe and our borders [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=487.92s)]
*  are our first line of defense, one of our early lines of defense. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=496.78s)]
*  Democrats support also enforcing laws, current laws, against those who came here illegally [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=501.68s)]
*  and those who hire illegal immigrants. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=508.94s)]
*  And the only way that we will stop the flow of illegal immigration into this country is [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=512.28s)]
*  tell those who hire them that they no longer can. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  That was before the Democratic Party decided to wholeheartedly embrace its role as corporate [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=521.0799999999999s)]
*  toadies and before more significantly they decided it's too hard to convince the population [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=526.16s)]
*  that our policies help them because in fact they don't help them at all. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=531.42s)]
*  It's much easier to guarantee that we will be elected into perpetuity by importing a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=535.68s)]
*  whole new population of voters and that's exactly what they're doing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=540.36s)]
*  And they bark like dogs when you say it because it's true. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=544.4s)]
*  But that was their position then. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  In fact, it was the Democratic Party's official position. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=553.4s)]
*  The Democratic position also recognized you got 11 million illegal aliens here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=554.4s)]
*  They have to have a way to earn their way into the deal. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=559.8000000000001s)]
*  This is an amnesty. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=562.28s)]
*  They're required to take 11 years worth. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=563.28s)]
*  They pay a fine. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=565.24s)]
*  They got to learn to speak English. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=566.24s)]
*  They got to pass testers. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=567.5600000000001s)]
*  I like the English part. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=569.76s)]
*  I like the English part. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=570.76s)]
*  If we want the problems of Canada right now, keep encouraging people to keep their foreign [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=571.76s)]
*  language. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=575.64s)]
*  English is going to unite this country potentially. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=576.64s)]
*  It always has in the past. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  I can't think of a country that has two languages as their accepted languages that is doing [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  all that well including Switzerland and or Canada. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  Well that was a completely different Joe Biden. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=590.88s)]
*  In fact, Sunday we're just going to spend an hour playing tape from Joe Biden five years [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=592.28s)]
*  ago and you can decide how he's doing now. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=596.16s)]
*  But that point that a divided country is united by language is true. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=598.5s)]
*  There is no country in the world that remains united but has different languages period. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=604.78s)]
*  And that's a central fact of life. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=610.02s)]
*  And everyone just a few years ago understood that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=613.78s)]
*  Now Joe Biden and the party he leads has decided that really nothing matters including who [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=616.7s)]
*  lives in the United States. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=621.94s)]
*  And amazingly some Republicans in the Congress appear to agree. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhdaaPgONg&t=624.14s)]
