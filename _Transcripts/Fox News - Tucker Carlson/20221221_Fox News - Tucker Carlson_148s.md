# Guys need to stop watching porn and take a girl on a real date: Sen. Josh Hawley #shorts
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ)
*  As we said, Josh Hawley represents Missouri in the U.S. Senate, and he joins us tonight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to explain his speech. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=5.08s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=6.84s)]
*  So tell us why, I mean, you're a U.S. Senator, you know, you help negotiate trade deals, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=8.84s)]
*  but you mentioned human relationships. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=14.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=16.52s)]
*  Well, somebody's got to be honest and tell the truth to these young men. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=17.52s)]
*  And the truth is, is what the porn industry is selling them is a total lie. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=21.52s)]
*  And the truth is, American society needs them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=24.76s)]
*  We need them to step up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=27.26s)]
*  We need them to go get married and have families and be responsible husbands and fathers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=28.94s)]
*  This society is impoverished because too many young men are too despairing or too checked [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=33.84s)]
*  out on social media or porn to be doing what we need them to do as a country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=39.14s)]
*  It's time to call people, to call young people in particular, young men to be something more. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=42.78s)]
*  And Tucker, they want to be called to it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  They don't want to be sold the bill of goods anymore. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  Somebody needs to tell them the truth. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=52.18000000000001s)]
*  No, I think that's exactly right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  But you, you're one of the very few people who said anything like this, certainly one [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=55.06s)]
*  of the very few elected officials, because it's considered really embarrassing to notice [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=59.22s)]
*  this is happening. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=62.74s)]
*  Why don't more people say it? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=64.54s)]
*  It seems like it's transformed our society completely. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=65.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that's because the liberal culture, what the message to young people [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=67.74000000000001s)]
*  is the most you can aspire to in life is to be a consumer who sits in a cubicle in front [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=71.98s)]
*  of a computer all day and doesn't ask any questions. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=76.38s)]
*  It doesn't do anything meaningful with your life. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=79.12s)]
*  And what we need to say to young men and young women, too, is just the opposite. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=81.1s)]
*  Aspire to be something more than a consumer. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=85.02s)]
*  And for young men, aspire to be something more than a consumer pornography. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=86.72s)]
*  Aspire to actually create something in your life, like create a family, for instance. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=90.3s)]
*  That is the single greatest act of rebellion, if you like, against the liberal culture that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=94.46s)]
*  is suppressing people's desires, that is suppressing their potential, is to go out and actually [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=100.34s)]
*  engage in real relationships, get married, have a family, have kids, have your own ideas [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=104.41999999999999s)]
*  and be a responsible member of society. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=110.1s)]
*  I mean, this is what people are built to do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=112.22s)]
*  And again, it's what young people want to do. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=114.58s)]
*  They want to be challenged in this way. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=116.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=118.06s)]
*  No, it's to, and I'm sure clips of you saying that will be everywhere later. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=119.06s)]
*  All the cool kids are making fun of you, cool kids who are not yet 60 and childless. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=122.94s)]
*  I just, I hope you keep saying it because I think it's clearly true. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=127.34s)]
*  And I think it's brave in the context of today. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=132.06s)]
*  Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, thank you very much. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=134.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBn2w9rKvQ&t=136.62s)]
