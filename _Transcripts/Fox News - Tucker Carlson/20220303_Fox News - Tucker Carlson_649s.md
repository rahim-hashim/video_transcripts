# Tucker: Why didn't we see this coming?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k)
*  So we should say we don't know anything, Ben, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=0.0s)]
*  what we just showed you, the pictures, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=2.24s)]
*  a lot of pictures that we just put up. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=3.44s)]
*  We don't know how this happened. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=4.84s)]
*  We, of course, don't know where it's going. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=5.92s)]
*  Nobody does. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=7.32s)]
*  But Ben Hall is clearly right when he says [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=8.64s)]
*  this could be a legitimate disaster for Europe. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=10.56s)]
*  But of course, the invasion of Ukraine [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=13.48s)]
*  already is a legitimate disaster for Europe [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=14.76s)]
*  and the rest of the world. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Europe just lost a huge percentage of its energy supply, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  which is not a small thing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=21.68s)]
*  We're all being reminded of that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=23.28s)]
*  So this situation appears to become more chaotic [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=25.04s)]
*  by the day, possibly even spinning out of control. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=29.0s)]
*  And that, we must be honest, is shocking to us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  We've been taken by surprise by the whole thing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=36.4s)]
*  We're not the only ones who were, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=38.4s)]
*  but we're willing to admit it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=39.44s)]
*  The only thing more embarrassing than being wrong [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=40.88s)]
*  in your estimates is pretending that you weren't. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=42.84s)]
*  So why didn't we see this coming, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=45.32s)]
*  this total loss of control? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=47.44s)]
*  Well, because we assumed that if things were dire, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  serious people would be involved in fixing them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=53.88s)]
*  But we looked up and we saw Kamala Harris involved. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=56.88s)]
*  And that reassured us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Harris had just come back from Europe [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=61.96s)]
*  where she'd been conducting, quote, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=63.36000000000001s)]
*  diplomacy with her allies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=64.36s)]
*  And that appeared to be proof [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=66.48s)]
*  this could not really be a big deal. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=67.56s)]
*  The situation in Ukraine had been legitimately serious. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=69.64s)]
*  If the future of Europe and the world hung in the balance, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=72.72s)]
*  as now so obviously it does, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=75.72s)]
*  of course, the Biden administration [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=77.92s)]
*  would not have sent Kamala Harris to fix it [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=79.56s)]
*  because that's not her job. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=82.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris's job is to trot down to the blue room [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  periodically to greet delegations of TikTok influencers [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=85.64s)]
*  or to cut occasional PSAs [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=88.64s)]
*  for the Children's Dental Health Awareness Month, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=89.92s)]
*  which is in February, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=91.6s)]
*  so we assumed she'd be working on that right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=92.44s)]
*  But averting war with Russia, saving the civilized world, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=94.92s)]
*  come on, that is absolutely not Kamala Harris's job. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=97.52s)]
*  That was our assumption. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=101.24s)]
*  But as noted, we were wrong. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=103.36s)]
*  Why were we wrong? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=107.44s)]
*  Well, we spend a lot of time watching Kamala Harris. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=108.56s)]
*  You probably don't. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=113.24s)]
*  Unless you are a junior producer at MSNBC, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=115.0s)]
*  you're probably not that familiar with Kamala Harris. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  We should say, by the way, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=121.64s)]
*  we didn't underestimate Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=123.36s)]
*  We overestimated Joe Biden. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=126.0s)]
*  But we knew that once Kamala Harris was involved, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=131.44s)]
*  it couldn't really be that serious. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=133.44s)]
*  And we knew that because this is what she's like. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=135.48s)]
*  It is time for us to do what we have been doing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=139.0s)]
*  and that time is every day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=143.0s)]
*  Every day it is time for us to agree. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=145.68s)]
*  This whole thing about the border, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=149.08s)]
*  we've been to the border. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=150.56s)]
*  We've been to the border. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=152.16s)]
*  You haven't been to the border. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=153.24s)]
*  And I haven't been to Europe. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=155.36s)]
*  And I mean, I don't. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=157.36s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=158.64s)]
*  And my pronouns are she, her, and hers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=159.72s)]
*  She, her, and hers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=161.96s)]
*  She would look down at me and Kamala, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=164.04s)]
*  what do you want, what do you want? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=165.36s)]
*  And I looked back up at her and I said, freedom. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=167.04s)]
*  You're going to literally see the craters on the moon [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=169.72s)]
*  with your own eyes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=175.08s)]
*  With your own eyes, I'm telling you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=177.56s)]
*  We must together, work together to see where we are, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=180.16s)]
*  where we are headed, but also see it as a moment, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=185.4s)]
*  yes, to together. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=188.24s)]
*  It is the perspective of a woman who grew up [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=190.8s)]
*  a black child in America, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=194.8s)]
*  who was also a prosecutor, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=197.84s)]
*  who also has a mother who arrived here at the age of 19 [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  from India, who also, you know, likes hip hop. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  What do you want to know? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=209.24s)]
*  Well, I want to give you, I want to give you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  This is just not a serious person, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=212.44s)]
*  not surrounded by serious people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=214.12s)]
*  And yet we are in an extremely serious moment [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=215.68s)]
*  that demands seriousness. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=218.72000000000003s)]
*  Of course, we must together, work together [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  to see where we are going together, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=222.4s)]
*  but also see it as a moment together. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=224.24s)]
*  If you've taken Peyote, you know what she means. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=226.84s)]
*  Otherwise you're probably baffled. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=228.4s)]
*  Once again, it's time for us to do what we've been doing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=230.4s)]
*  And that time is every day. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=232.16s)]
*  It's like a Clio Gabrán poem, but the illiterate version, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=234.04s)]
*  impossible to parse. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=236.56s)]
*  When Kamala Harris speaks, you get the feeling [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=237.84s)]
*  you're either too dumb or too smart [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=239.28s)]
*  to understand what she's saying. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=240.84s)]
*  But then within a few sentences, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=241.88s)]
*  you settle firmly on the latter. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=243.0s)]
*  What do our European allies think of this? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=246.36s)]
*  Well, of course, they've come to the same conclusion. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=248.16s)]
*  Less than two weeks ago, as all of this was brewing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  on the brink, the Biden administration sent that person, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=251.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris, to represent the United States [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=255.8s)]
*  at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=257.76s)]
*  And while she was there, she assured the world [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  that she and Joe Biden had this situation [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=263.44s)]
*  completely under control. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=265.52s)]
*  Yes, Putin would like to invade Ukraine. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=266.6s)]
*  Of course he would, but not on her watch. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=268.36s)]
*  Not while Kamala Harris was on the same continent, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=270.24s)]
*  this continent known as Europe. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=273.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=274.08s)]
*  Harris exuded what novelists call a steely resolve. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  Imagine being first in line for a shoe sale on Black Friday. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=278.6s)]
*  Kamala Harris had that look. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  She knew what she wanted and she knew where to find it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=283.0s)]
*  And here's how she expressed that resolve. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=286.64s)]
*  And yes, this is a verbatim quote [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=288.2s)]
*  from the Munich Security Conference. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=289.92s)]
*  Quote, perhaps this is a moment as life does present us [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=291.48s)]
*  with those moments that challenge us to ask [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=295.08s)]
*  what is our reason for being? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=297.36s)]
*  And I think we all know the history of NATO [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=299.36s)]
*  and its reason for being. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=301.12s)]
*  The spirit behind this term we use, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  the Transatlantic community, the word community [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=303.76s)]
*  meaning a collection, not a collection of individuals [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  who see themselves as a collection, then as one. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=308.8s)]
*  And that's where we are now. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=311.72s)]
*  So if the Vice President of the United States [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=313.6s)]
*  interrupts an adult security conference to talk like that, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=316.56s)]
*  you conclude that whatever crisis they're talking about [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=321.56s)]
*  at the conference couldn't be imminent. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=324.6s)]
*  They must have plenty of time to fix it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's why they could afford to send Kamala Harris [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=328.92s)]
*  in the first place, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=331.0s)]
*  because actually it's not as big a deal as it seems. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  Clearly the White House must see the European heads of state [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=334.12s)]
*  as equivalent to TikTok influencers. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=336.16s)]
*  And this is some kind of photo op. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=338.04s)]
*  That's what we concluded. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=340.12s)]
*  How could we not conclude that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  And then there was this clue. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=342.28s)]
*  The day after Kamala Harris said the words we just read, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  talked about her reason for being, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=348.55999999999995s)]
*  the day after she said that, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  she explicitly encouraged Ukraine to join NATO. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=352.08s)]
*  Quote, I appreciate and admire [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=355.76s)]
*  President Zelensky's desire to join NATO. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=357.55999999999995s)]
*  She said that at a press event. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=359.44s)]
*  Now we saw that and we thought, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=361.32s)]
*  obviously the Biden people must have this under control [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  in some way we don't know about. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  They must have some secret back channel to Putin. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  They must have been fully informed [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=369.52s)]
*  They must have been fully assured [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=371.44s)]
*  that saying something so unbelievably inflammatory [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=372.76s)]
*  is not going to push Putin to invade Ukraine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=376.08s)]
*  We assume that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, how could it be otherwise? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=380.44s)]
*  It's the United States. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=381.32s)]
*  It's a real country. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  The idea that Ukraine might join NATO [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=384.36s)]
*  obviously caused this crisis in the first place, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=385.96s)]
*  whatever you think of it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  We know, cause we've watched for years, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=389.28s)]
*  the more Western leaders pushed the idea of Ukraine and NATO, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  the closer Russians came to invading Ukraine. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=393.96s)]
*  It's not a defense of that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=397.52s)]
*  It's an observation of it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  That's true. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=399.52s)]
*  So obviously no sane person would say something like that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=400.44s)]
*  with Russian troops masked on the Ukrainian border. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=403.84s)]
*  You'd have to want an invasion of Ukraine [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=406.84s)]
*  to say something like that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=409.64s)]
*  And at the time we didn't think they did want that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=410.68s)]
*  So we got it completely wrong. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=412.8s)]
*  And honestly, we've continued to get it wrong ever since. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=414.72s)]
*  We assume that once Kamala Harris humiliated [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=417.28s)]
*  the United States in Munich [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=419.88s)]
*  and jeopardized his core interests, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=420.96s)]
*  that maybe her boss, Joe Biden, would realize [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=423.0s)]
*  maybe borders aren't her thing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=425.12s)]
*  Maybe if you want to keep the border between two countries [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=426.6s)]
*  maybe you don't send Kamala Harris. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris believes borders are racist or something. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=431.92s)]
*  So obviously it's pretty hard for her to protect borders. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=433.88s)]
*  So it was always a strange personnel choice. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  Biden's been around a while. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=438.24s)]
*  You think, you know, the key to good management [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=439.24s)]
*  is matching the person with the job. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=441.04s)]
*  Not everybody's good at everything. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=442.6s)]
*  So if you're looking for someone to date Montel Williams, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=444.56s)]
*  well, maybe she's the person you would choose. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=447.24s)]
*  She could be a solid choice that she's done it before. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  Dating Montel Williams, you know, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  is something that's within her range of experience. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  Is she good at it? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=457.76s)]
*  We can't say she's, but she's done it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  But this new gig, deescalating a world ending conflict [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=460.44s)]
*  with a nuclear armed rogue state? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=464.68s)]
*  No, no, not when nuclear reactors are on fire. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=467.2s)]
*  But they're doing it anyway. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=473.2s)]
*  Humiliating our country, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=475.32s)]
*  jeopardizing our safety in the future of the world. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=476.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris is now the point person on Ukraine. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=480.36s)]
*  In Diplo's speak, she's got the Ukraine portfolio. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=483.68s)]
*  What's she doing with that portfolio? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, starting at the beginning, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=490.03999999999996s)]
*  splitting things to the American public. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=490.92s)]
*  If the world economy is gonna collapse [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=492.28s)]
*  and you're no longer gonna be able to afford meat for dinner, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  if Europe's not gonna have power, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=496.8s)]
*  you should probably know why. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=498.36s)]
*  And it has nothing to do, they assure you, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=499.48s)]
*  with the criminal negligence of people [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=501.0s)]
*  like Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=502.44s)]
*  No, it's because of a place called Ukraine. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=503.56s)]
*  Listen. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=506.52s)]
*  Break it down in layman's terms [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=508.0s)]
*  for people who don't understand what's going on [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  and how can this directly affect the people [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=511.4s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=513.28s)]
*  So, Ukraine is a country in Europe. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=514.32s)]
*  It exists next to another country called Russia. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=519.0s)]
*  Russia is a bigger country. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=522.6400000000001s)]
*  Russia is a powerful country. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=524.36s)]
*  Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=526.0s)]
*  So, basically, that's wrong. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  If you are patronizing people to that degree [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=535.08s)]
*  in the middle of a crisis this serious, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=538.5200000000001s)]
*  you should not be in a position of leadership. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  Translation, I've never read a book in my life. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=543.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm assuming you haven't either. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=545.88s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=546.76s)]
*  Ukraine is a country in Europe, right. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=548.3599999999999s)]
*  Okay, following you, Kamala Harris. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=549.8s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  Watching this, maybe you're starting to understand [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=553.76s)]
*  what the whole point of this administration is. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=556.04s)]
*  It's the equity agenda. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=557.76s)]
*  And under the terms of that agenda, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=558.68s)]
*  only the least capable are allowed to assume [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=560.4799999999999s)]
*  positions of authority in the United States. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=562.56s)]
*  It's governed by the dumbest. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=564.04s)]
*  That's how Pete Buttigieg, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=565.8s)]
*  a guy who can barely drive his own car, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=567.2399999999999s)]
*  wound up in charge of all of our roads. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=568.92s)]
*  And so, all these people got their jobs. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=571.8s)]
*  It was intentional. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=573.24s)]
*  Now, Washington has worked this way, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  to some extent, for a long time. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=575.84s)]
*  It's just that under this president, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=577.8s)]
*  the principle has reached its horrifying, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=579.24s)]
*  but logical, end point. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=580.96s)]
*  The last president hired Michael Cohen [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=582.16s)]
*  to be his personal lawyer. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=583.76s)]
*  But the difference is Donald Trump didn't make Michael Cohen [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=584.84s)]
*  the Attorney General of the United States. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=587.6s)]
*  Biden absolutely would do that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=589.24s)]
*  as long as Cohen was transgender. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=590.44s)]
*  And you know that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=591.8s)]
*  So, it shouldn't surprise you, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=593.6s)]
*  though it should horrify you and make you nervous, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=595.04s)]
*  that according to the Hill newspaper, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=597.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris is going back to Europe [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=598.8s)]
*  to see how much worse she can make this disaster. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=602.28s)]
*  She'll be heading to Warsaw, Poland, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=605.12s)]
*  and Bucharest, Romania to, quote, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  show solidarity with Ukraine, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=607.6s)]
*  which means to badly damage key American interests [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=609.12s)]
*  in inventive new ways you haven't yet imagined. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=612.6s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=615.36s)]
*  A crisis that gets more grave by the day, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=616.64s)]
*  whose ramifications are clearly more serious [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=619.28s)]
*  than anyone expected, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  overseen by people who have no wisdom [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=623.36s)]
*  or foresight or restraint, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=625.72s)]
*  and fundamentally don't have the interests of our country [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=627.4399999999999s)]
*  at heart when they make their decisions. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=629.6s)]
*  And Kamala Harris isn't the only problem, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=631.92s)]
*  but she's the most glaring symbol of it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox9ZBBVrm2k&t=634.4799999999999s)]
