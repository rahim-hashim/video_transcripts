# Ramaswamy: This was a bailout of Silicon Valley itself
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8)
*  To answer those questions, Vick Ramaswamy joins us. He is of course running for president. He's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=0.0s)]
*  also a long-time finance guy, venture capitalist, knows the industry well, joins us tonight. Vick, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=4.0s)]
*  thank you so much for coming on. So first just, and I know these are complicated questions, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=8.08s)]
*  but just assess if you will, how most people experience the news that the government is [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  bailing out a bank where 95% of the deposits were over 250,000. Deposits put there by people who pay [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=19.84s)]
*  half the tax rate you do because they benefit from the carried interest loophole. That does [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=27.12s)]
*  look a little rigged. I'm just throwing that out there. Oh, it's absolutely rigged, Tucker. There's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  a two-rule system in this country. There's the rule for the favorite class and then the rules for [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=35.6s)]
*  everybody else. The rules for everybody else is $250,000 maximum, but this was really a bailout [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  of Silicon Valley itself. The tech startups who made disastrous financial decisions to bank as [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=45.2s)]
*  much as they did with Silicon Valley Bank, but what does the federal government say? Don't worry [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=51.2s)]
*  about it. We're going to come in and save you. Even companies like Roku that staggeringly had [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=55.44s)]
*  over $480 million, that's unconscionable, yet what we say is that's okay. You get to keep making [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=59.92s)]
*  those disastrous decisions. Now, Tucker, the logic, and actually many of these venture capitalists [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=65.68s)]
*  that invested in these companies, they had a perverse incentive to fearmonger and create [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=70.32s)]
*  the conditions for a bank run because the more likely a bank run was, the more likely it was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=75.28s)]
*  that they would get that bailout for those tech startups on Sunday night. So kudos to them for [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=80.24s)]
*  playing crony capitalism well. That's exactly what they got done. But you think about this, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=85.04s)]
*  you had a really good point there. I can't think of a more disastrous way to shake confidence than [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  to call an emergency meeting on Sunday night and say, here's a bank that we told you for the longest [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=95.04s)]
*  time was not systemically important, that itself claimed that it wasn't systemically important, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=99.92s)]
*  but now we're going to use a designation of calling it systemically important to make a bailout to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=104.72s)]
*  its depositors. So actually, I think that this is a game that is a downward march, just like ESG [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=110.0s)]
*  came out of the 2008 financial crisis, central bank digital currencies are what's going to come [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=115.12s)]
*  out of this next one. And I think that this is something that every Republican, frankly, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=119.44s)]
*  every American needs to be clear about. We have to say absolutely not to that level of social credit [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=123.44s)]
*  scoring that could unfold on the back of this. And you mark my words, it's marking yours as well, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=128.48s)]
*  this is likely where this is heading. It's a longer term game to a disaster. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=132.88s)]
*  So very quickly, how long before people start to ask, okay, these long term treasuries, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=137.44s)]
*  now that interest rates have gone up or worth less than we thought they were, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=141.28s)]
*  who else is holding huge, I mean, the Fed itself and what other banks [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  are counting these as cash equivalents? Like, how nervous should we be? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=148.24s)]
*  Look, I think there's a lot of sins to pay for years of actually skiing on artificial snow. Now [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  the snow machine turned off. Now the real evidence actually starts to surface. And Tucker, the other [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=158.96s)]
*  thing I'll tell you is even over the weekend, right, I got calls from Silicon Valley elites, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=163.92s)]
*  okay, saying that, you know what, I was going to support you, people in the billionaire class, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  whatever, but you're speaking out about this, speaking this openly. No, I'm going to lose donor [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=171.6s)]
*  support. My view is, you know what, this is a moment for a grassroots uprising. That's why, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, look, I've put in eight figures into this campaign myself, but it's going to have to be [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=180.16s)]
*  grassroots bottom up. And so Vivek2024.com, let's actually get the grassroots uprising going [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  instead of actually the one sided Silicon Valley agenda here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=189.76s)]
*  Well, this is the kind of thing that, you know, provokes uprisings, I would say. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=193.44s)]
*  Vivek, thank you so much. Ramaswamy, thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=196.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk3LlZKIt8&t=200.56s)]
