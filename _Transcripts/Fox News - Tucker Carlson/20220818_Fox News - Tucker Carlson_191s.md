# Tucker Carlson: Democracy has prevailed in Wyoming
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs)
*  So Liz Cheney is from Northern Virginia, but somehow she wound up as the only member of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=0.0s)]
*  Congress from Wyoming. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  How'd that happen? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=10.24s)]
*  Well, nepotism, obviously. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=11.24s)]
*  But what's interesting is that rather than represent Wyoming, Cheney decided she was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=12.86s)]
*  going to spend her time in Congress representing something called democracy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=17.32s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=20.84s)]
*  Every one of us who has sworn the oath must act to prevent the unraveling of our democracy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=22.8s)]
*  And the peril of this moment for our democracy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=29.96s)]
*  As the party of Reagan, Republicans have championed democracy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=33.08s)]
*  Democracy is fragile. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=37.36s)]
*  Democracy is fragile. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=39.36s)]
*  Democracy is fragile. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=41.44s)]
*  Democracy only survives if citizens are willing to defend it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=43.08s)]
*  So it turns out democracy is like that boyfriend you've got in another city. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  You kind of talk them up a lot, but you don't really want them to show up, other people [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  to meet them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=56.56s)]
*  What happened to Liz Cheney last night? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  She showed up in Wyoming. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=59.68s)]
*  And Liz Cheney suffered the single biggest defeat in a primary by an incumbent this century. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=61.36s)]
*  So it turns out democracy is a cruel master. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=68.0s)]
*  You got to be careful. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=70.72s)]
*  I can whip around and bite you in the butt. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=71.72s)]
*  But what's funny is that over at CNN, they're still defending democracy, but they have no [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=74.38s)]
*  idea what it is. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=77.88s)]
*  From CNN's perspective and from Liz Cheney's, it turns out democracy means you shut up [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=80.72s)]
*  and submit to the rule of people who haven't been elected. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=87.84s)]
*  In the case of Liz Cheney, CNN believes democracy means keeping her in power despite the fact [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  the people she represents don't like her. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=94.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=96.8s)]
*  We're keeping a close watch on Wyoming. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=97.8s)]
*  And what happens there tonight could add to a trend. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=101.44s)]
*  And that is election deniers winning primaries around the nation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=103.84s)]
*  What does that mean for our democracy and the risk of more chaos like what we saw on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=108.96s)]
*  January 6th? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=112.88s)]
*  When voters totally reject a candidate that we in CNN like, when voters actually vote, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  which is of course the core ritual of democracy, it's the essence of democracy, when they do [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=125.2s)]
*  that, it's a threat to democracy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  And of course, Liz Cheney agrees. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=133.44s)]
*  Her losing definitively in Wyoming is the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=135.4s)]
*  War. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=141.08s)]
*  And she should know because effectively, she's a Blinken. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=142.08s)]
*  The great and original champion of our party, Abraham Lincoln, was defeated in elections [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=146.2s)]
*  for the Senate and the House before he won the most important election of all. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  Lincoln ultimately prevailed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=158.32s)]
*  He saved our union and he defined our obligation as Americans for all of history. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  I lost, Lincoln lost. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Me, me, me, me, me, I'm Lincoln. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  Another sad middle-aged rich lady narcissism trip for sure. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=173.0s)]
*  But you have to wonder if there aren't lessons in all of this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=177.36s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens, stories that are [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkmJ5BHOaLs&t=180.56s)]
