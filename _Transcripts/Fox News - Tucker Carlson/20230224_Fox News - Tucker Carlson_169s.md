# East Palestine resident tells Tucker about 'unreal corruption' in cleanup efforts
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs)
*  So really we mock people like that as stupid, but underneath it all is hate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what that is. That's hate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  She hates her fellow Americans who live in East Palestine and places like it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=6.04s)]
*  You should know that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=10.16s)]
*  Courtney Miller lives in East Palestine. She joins us tonight. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Courtney, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=13.88s)]
*  You're still there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=15.96s)]
*  The Secretary of Transportation came today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=17.6s)]
*  Do you think the visit made a difference? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=19.88s)]
*  Not at all. Not at all. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Just like every meeting that they are trying to have here, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=25.12s)]
*  we never get answers. Everybody gets the go around. It's still nothing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=28.88s)]
*  They're not doing anything. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=33.44s)]
*  FEMA's, I was told FEMA's supposed to be here numerous times. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=34.88s)]
*  There's still no FEMA anywhere. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  I just don't understand. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=40.08s)]
*  I don't understand why they're saying that they're going to do it and then they don't. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Are you, I mean, you're around here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, I've noticed, but your most pressing concern has got to be the question [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=47.72s)]
*  of whether it's safe to live there, since you live there and you probably don't have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  a winter house in Palm Beach, so you're going to stay there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  Do you know if it's safe to be there? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  Not currently. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  I mean, has anyone explained that? No. You don't know. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  I don't know, but I did hire Scott Smith, who's been taking samples out of the creek [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  in my backyard before they decided to try to dilute it so that we couldn't get samples. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=71.39999999999999s)]
*  But those samples were sent out. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=76.92s)]
*  Those samples are being tested for dioxins and vinyl chloride and multiple other chemicals. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=79.36s)]
*  And they are not being sent to anywhere near Ohio or Pennsylvania. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  They're being sent elsewhere in the country. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=90.04s)]
*  And here soon within, I'm hoping, the next couple of weeks, we'll be able to have results sooner than later. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=92.52s)]
*  And then we can actually find out for sure what is actually in that creek and how toxic it really is. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  Because as you can see, like, I still don't sound the way I did the last time we talked. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=105.08s)]
*  And that's because I've been here for a couple of days and it's affecting my voice at this point. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=109.84s)]
*  I sound very raspy and it's harder to breathe. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=114.68s)]
*  And it was such a nice day today. It was 70 degrees. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=117.4s)]
*  I walked outside and I sat down. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=119.64s)]
*  I wish I could say I took a breath of fresh air, but that's not the case here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=121.4s)]
*  It still smells. It smells horrible. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=125.88s)]
*  My creek is terrible. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=128.12s)]
*  It's just it's it's just like a gas chamber that we're in. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=130.28s)]
*  You can't find what you're not looking for. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=134.44s)]
*  And I know that they're not looking for that as per their results on their testing that they've done. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=136.68s)]
*  And then they were trespassing on my yard on top of it and diluting the creek so I couldn't get things. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=142.12s)]
*  It's it's unreal. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=146.68s)]
*  Corruption. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, if you were Ukrainian, you'd be a top priority. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm just sorry they could not. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=154.08s)]
*  Courtney Miller, thanks so much for that update from this Palestinian. Appreciate it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOm-Vh3slSs&t=155.08s)]
