# Tucker: Leaders refuse to acknowledge this is killing people
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=0.0s)]
*  Sinaloa is a province in Northwest Mexico. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=2.52s)]
*  It's directly across from the bottom of Baja, California. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=5.76s)]
*  It's not that far from the United States [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=8.32s)]
*  and that's a bad thing because Sinaloa, Mexico [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=9.88s)]
*  may now be the single largest producer and distributor [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=12.52s)]
*  of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=16.72s)]
*  Cartels are making fentanyl in mass quantities [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=19.36s)]
*  in Sinaloa now, but they're not making it [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  for domestic consumption within Mexico. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=23.72s)]
*  They're making it to export here and you can see why. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=25.88s)]
*  In the capital of Sinaloa, 11 pounds of fentanyl [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=29.76s)]
*  typically sells for around $15,000. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=32.440000000000005s)]
*  In the United States, that same amount of fentanyl [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=35.4s)]
*  sells for more than $100,000. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=37.64s)]
*  So you can see the incentive. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  How much fentanyl is that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=42.44s)]
*  Well, just two milligrams of the drug [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=44.32s)]
*  can be lethal to a human being. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=46.96s)]
*  That means 11 pounds contains nearly 2.5 million [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  fatal doses of fentanyl. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=52.52s)]
*  Again, there's a major financial incentive [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  for the drug cartels which run huge parts of Mexico [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=57.48s)]
*  to produce this drug and ship it north and they are. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=60.68s)]
*  If cocaine was the drug of the 1980s, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=64.6s)]
*  we are now living in the fentanyl era [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=66.52s)]
*  and the numbers show it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  Not so long ago, between October 2012 and October 2013, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  Customs and Border Protection seized just two pounds [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=74.36s)]
*  of fentanyl total at our southern border. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=77.44s)]
*  Compare that to what we're seeing now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=80.28s)]
*  In the first eight months of this year, first eight months, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  the US government seized more than 7,200 pounds of fentanyl. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=85.04s)]
*  That's the highest amount seized by far. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=89.08s)]
*  And keep in mind, that's likely just a small percentage [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=91.52s)]
*  of the fentanyl that came over the border [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=93.4s)]
*  since it is odorless and difficult to detect. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=95.32s)]
*  According to a recent report [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=98.92s)]
*  by the US Sentencing Commission, quote, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=100.0s)]
*  since fiscal year 2015, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=101.8s)]
*  the number of fentanyl offenders reported the commission [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  more than doubled each fiscal year, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=106.6s)]
*  resulting in a 3,592% increase. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=108.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, federal authorities recently announced [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=115.0s)]
*  that they have seized nearly 10 million counterfeit pills [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=117.32s)]
*  and many of them were laced with fentanyl. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=120.04s)]
*  That was all in a single year. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=121.48s)]
*  News reports from Chicago say, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=123.36s)]
*  as they do in so many cities, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=125.68s)]
*  fentanyl has become an epidemic. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=127.2s)]
*  The pill on the left is Xanax. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=130.32s)]
*  The one on the right is counterfeit. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=132.24s)]
*  Not knowing the difference can be deadly. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=134.08s)]
*  The Drug Enforcement Administration [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=136.12s)]
*  warns of a dramatic increase in fake prescription pills [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=137.96s)]
*  flooding the market from criminal drug networks in Mexico. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=141.16s)]
*  The drugs made to look like oxy or Adderall [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  are laced with fentanyl or meth, often in deadly doses. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=147.96s)]
*  The DEA has seized more than 9.5 million counterfeit pills [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=151.96s)]
*  so far this year and the head of the Chicago Division [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=155.84s)]
*  says they've seized more than 600 pounds of fentanyl. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  So why are we telling you all this about fentanyl? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=162.68s)]
*  Because the rise in the consumption of fentanyl [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=165.24s)]
*  mirrors the rise in the availability of fentanyl, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=168.28s)]
*  the massive rise in deaths by fentanyl OD. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=171.28s)]
*  And all of that is a result [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=174.56s)]
*  of the Biden administration's immigration policy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=177.04s)]
*  When you open the borders, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  it's not just people who comes in, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=181.24s)]
*  it's massive amounts of fentanyl and other illegal drugs. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=183.72s)]
*  So the Biden administration tells you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=187.64s)]
*  that their border policy is, quote, humane, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=189.04s)]
*  but it's just the opposite. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=191.88s)]
*  That policy has resulted in this country [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=193.44s)]
*  becoming flooded with fentanyl [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=195.76s)]
*  and it's resulted in the deaths of many thousands, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=198.08s)]
*  many thousands of Americans. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=200.8s)]
*  The latest data from the CDC shows [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  that drug overdose deaths in the United States [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=204.96s)]
*  hit a new high, almost 100,000 deaths of American citizens [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=207.08s)]
*  during the 12 month period that ended in March of this year. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  How much more is that from last year? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=216.24s)]
*  Well, it's a 30% increase in one year. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  So there are a lot of reasons this is happening, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=221.44s)]
*  but one of the main reasons is government policy, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=224.8s)]
*  which has made the population sedentary and depressed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=227.4s)]
*  Our government spent the last year, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=231.52s)]
*  in case you haven't noticed, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=232.72000000000003s)]
*  locking everyone inside their homes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=233.56s)]
*  And the result of that is that drugs are everywhere [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=235.84s)]
*  and major American cities are now unrecognizable. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  Take a look at this report [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=241.52s)]
*  from San Francisco's local news station, watch. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  The rate of accidental drug overdoses, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  hospitalizations and deaths [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  is outpacing the city's expanding teams [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=250.88000000000002s)]
*  of crisis intervention specialists. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=253.36s)]
*  Fentanyl, a powerful and highly addictive synthetic opioid, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=255.32s)]
*  much cheaper than heroin, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=258.68s)]
*  entered the San Francisco drug market a few years ago. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=260.32s)]
*  Fentanyl has been the large driver for these increases [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=263.24s)]
*  in accidental overdose deaths. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=266.8s)]
*  The powerful narcotic was responsible [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=268.96s)]
*  for more than 500 deaths last year [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=270.84s)]
*  and has become the drug of choice [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=273.12s)]
*  for many users in San Francisco. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=274.72s)]
*  KTVU has been documenting the epidemic for months. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=276.56s)]
*  Many experts believe that social isolation [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=280.0s)]
*  from the coronavirus may be contributing to the death toll. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=282.24s)]
*  So what we refer to habitually is our homeless crisis, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=287.2s)]
*  which is bigger than it's ever been in American history, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=290.56s)]
*  is not primarily about homes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=292.6s)]
*  It's not even primarily about mental illness, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=294.08s)]
*  strictly speaking. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=296.0s)]
*  It's mostly about drugs and drug addiction. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=297.08s)]
*  None of this should really surprise us. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=301.12s)]
*  Our leaders have spent the last year [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=302.88s)]
*  dividing Americans from each other. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  The result is loneliness. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=306.04s)]
*  They closed the churches, they closed the gyms. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=307.12s)]
*  They forced people to stay apart from their family [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=309.36s)]
*  friends and the people they're closest to. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=312.16s)]
*  And at the very same moment, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  the Biden administration has opened the border, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=316.0s)]
*  allowing a massive wave of this highly addictive, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  deadly synthetic opioid to enter this country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  So what do you think happened? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=325.72s)]
*  Well, an awful lot of people died. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=327.04s)]
*  And this was a result of bad policy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=329.32000000000005s)]
*  But the Biden administration [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=332.0s)]
*  isn't simply ignoring the problem. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  They're not apologizing for it, of course. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=336.12s)]
*  They're doing something even more destructive. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  They're making it worse. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  They're making it less possible for the US government [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  to control what comes across our border. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=345.56s)]
*  You remember they blamed the border patrol [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=348.24s)]
*  for daring to patrol the border on horseback. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=350.12s)]
*  Now they've dominated a genuine radical, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=352.44s)]
*  an extremist called Chris Magnus, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=354.56s)]
*  to lead customs and border protection. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=356.56s)]
*  How extreme is Chris Magnus? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, during his confirmation hearings [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=361.72s)]
*  in the Congress yesterday, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=363.16s)]
*  Magnus was asked repeatedly [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=364.44s)]
*  whether what is happening at the border is a crisis. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=366.04s)]
*  And repeatedly, he refused to say that it was. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=368.6s)]
*  Tens of thousands of Americans are dying [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=372.24s)]
*  because of this border policy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=374.52s)]
*  And yet here's the man who the Biden administration [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=376.72s)]
*  would like to run the border responded. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=379.6s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=382.12s)]
*  You believe we have a crisis at the southern border, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  yes or no? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=385.64s)]
*  Senator, I'm not sure. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=388.2s)]
*  Does it really matter whether we call it a major challenge, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=390.2s)]
*  a crisis, a big problem? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=394.12s)]
*  Do we have a crisis at the border, yes or no? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=397.28s)]
*  Senator, let me assure you that no one [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=399.64s)]
*  believes there is greater urgency to this matter than I do. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=403.44s)]
*  Are you saying there is not a crisis at the border? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  Senator, no, I don't think there, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=410.11999999999995s)]
*  I don't think, I don't speak too urgent [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=412.84s)]
*  as less serious at all. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=416.23999999999995s)]
*  In fact, is there a crisis [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  or is there not a crisis at the border? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=419.32s)]
*  Senator, I would say that my highest priority is going to- [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=421.64s)]
*  I didn't ask your priority. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=425.76s)]
*  I asked to characterize the situation on the border. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=427.8s)]
*  Is there a crisis at the border? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  What I'm certainly trying to convey is how serious [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  I take what's happening at the border [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=434.8s)]
*  and the amount of work that I wanna put into addressing it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  So here's a guy who's totally beholden [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=440.44s)]
*  to the radical nonprofits, the NGOs, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=443.36s)]
*  many funded by George Soros, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=445.72s)]
*  that control our immigration policy. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  He's so beholden to them that he can't tell [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=449.56s)]
*  an obvious truth under oath for fear of offending them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=452.24s)]
*  They're his real constituency, not you [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=456.36s)]
*  or anyone else who lives in this country. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=458.88s)]
*  It's the radical NGOs that would like to open the border, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=461.12s)]
*  knowing full well that doing so will result [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=464.2s)]
*  in the deaths of many thousands of Americans [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=467.64s)]
*  from the drugs that are also coming across the border. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  But our leadership class is so decadent [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=473.48s)]
*  that they don't even acknowledge that drug use is a problem [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=475.88s)]
*  or a crisis, as Chris Magnus refused to say. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=478.8s)]
*  They think it's fine. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=481.76s)]
*  So Chris Magnus says he's gonna take the border [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=484.16s)]
*  as you well know that he is going to do his level best [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=486.16s)]
*  to allow as many foreign nationals to come here as possible [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  and many will be bringing drugs. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=491.2s)]
*  So this is more than just irresponsible. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=493.64s)]
*  It's more than just ideological. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=495.72s)]
*  It is reckless, it is dangerous, it is criminal. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  The role of the federal government [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=501.48s)]
*  is not to protect economic migrants from Haiti. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  It is not to improve the living standards in other countries. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=505.64s)]
*  It is not to pack the electorate [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=508.04s)]
*  on behalf of a specific political party. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=510.0s)]
*  It has only one role and one role alone. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=512.08s)]
*  It is to protect American citizens. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=516.36s)]
*  It is to serve their interests. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=518.04s)]
*  But they're not doing that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=521.12s)]
*  They're doing exactly the opposite. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVfyOS1RqKM&t=522.1999999999999s)]
