# Iowa teen rescues elderly man and dog from icy lake
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY)
*  So here is an equally amazing but much happier story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=0.0s)]
*  So a few days ago in Iowa, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=2.92s)]
*  an 83 year old man was driving with his dog [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  to go ice fishing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=6.76s)]
*  He had a fishing shack out on the lake. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=7.76s)]
*  Then the man's Jeep fell through the ice and into the lake. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=10.24s)]
*  Several rescuers jumped into action [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=13.88s)]
*  because Iowa is an extremely nice state. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  And one of the rescuers was a 17 year old high school student [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=18.0s)]
*  called Joseph Salmon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=20.92s)]
*  He was ice fishing with his mom [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=21.84s)]
*  when he saw the Jeep go under. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=23.44s)]
*  He was able to help save the man and his dog. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=24.96s)]
*  And so we wanted to talk to him tonight [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=28.52s)]
*  and we are, Joseph Salmon joins us tonight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=29.96s)]
*  Joseph, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  Few things scarier than someone going under the ice. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=34.28s)]
*  How did you help get this man and his dog out? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=37.44s)]
*  So as soon as I seen him go into the water, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=42.2s)]
*  I turned around and yelled at my mom [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=45.6s)]
*  and told her he went through [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=47.86s)]
*  and I had 911 ready to dial [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=49.3s)]
*  because as I seen him going over there, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=51.2s)]
*  I see him go through. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=53.18s)]
*  As I was running, I called 911. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Called 911, ran over there [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=57.64s)]
*  and for a second, I was standing on the shoreline [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=60.28s)]
*  and another guy came down. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  We were like waving at him, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=64.84s)]
*  like trying to tell him to get out, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=66.16s)]
*  get out of the Jeep. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=68.76s)]
*  And he was just kind of in shock. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  Didn't really know what to do. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=71.2s)]
*  He was just kind of sitting there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=72.04s)]
*  And as we were waving, more people came down [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=73.84s)]
*  and one of the guys said there's a child in the Jeep. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  And as soon as someone said there was a child, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  I got everything I needed off my first layer [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=83.04s)]
*  and I jumped into the water, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=86.16s)]
*  got to the Jeep, tried opening the back door, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=88.44s)]
*  which it was locked, it would not open [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=91.52s)]
*  and I broke the back window. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  You went into the, oh, this is a little more dramatic [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=96.28s)]
*  than I realized. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=98.24s)]
*  You went into the water in a frozen lake [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=99.08s)]
*  and smashed the back window? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=100.44s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=102.8s)]
*  How did you get, was there a child in the Jeep [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=103.64s)]
*  and how did you get the man and his dog out? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=105.88s)]
*  So after I broke the back window, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=110.12s)]
*  I used a knife to break the back window [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=111.6s)]
*  and he was, when I broke, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=113.4s)]
*  as I was breaking the back window, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=114.92s)]
*  he was getting out of his seat [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=115.88s)]
*  and he started to crawl through the back [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=118.4s)]
*  and he got, his foot was stuck [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=120.0s)]
*  between the center council and the seat. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=122.4s)]
*  So I went all the way into the Jeep, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=124.92s)]
*  into the front of it, pulled his leg out, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=126.64s)]
*  pushed on the bottom of it to push him up [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=129.84s)]
*  and I crawled back out to have more room for them to come. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=131.88s)]
*  And as he was coming between the seat [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=135.88s)]
*  and the roof of the Jeep, he was, it's very, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=138.44s)]
*  it's not a very big gap and he couldn't get through that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=141.2s)]
*  So I went back in the Jeep, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  I pushed him back towards the front and pushed him up. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=145.96s)]
*  So on a Jeep backseat, there's like a lever on top of it [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=149.36s)]
*  to fold the seat down. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=152.52s)]
*  So I pushed him back, I flipped the seat down [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=154.52s)]
*  and grabbed him by under his shoulders [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=157.32s)]
*  and started pulling him out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=158.56s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=161.28s)]
*  17. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=164.32s)]
*  That's just an absolutely crazy story. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=166.32s)]
*  I don't think one in a hundred, a thousand people [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=167.8s)]
*  would get into a car going under a frozen lake. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=170.0s)]
*  I mean, that is just, that is heroism [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  and I appreciate your coming on [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=175.28s)]
*  and telling us about it tonight. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=176.6s)]
*  Joseph Salmon, thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=178.16s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdRbLM66wY&t=179.0s)]
