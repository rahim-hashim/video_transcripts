# Candace Owens: Democrat 'criminals' in office sold out the American people
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0)
*  Candace Owens has been watching all of this and analyzing what it means for a long time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=0.0s)]
*  She's hosted the Candace Owens podcast. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  We're happy to have her. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=6.32s)]
*  Candace, I mean, these videos are getting more and more extreme. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=7.32s)]
*  They're not performances. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=11.48s)]
*  They're real. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=12.48s)]
*  It's Americans who are being targeted and suffering and killed. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=13.48s)]
*  Why is no one saying anything about this? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=16.86s)]
*  Well, first and foremost, Tucker, you mentioned Kim Foxx in Chicago, and I just want to say [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  what you forgot to mention is the fact that she's both black and a female, and also the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  mayor of Chicago is black and a female. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=29.56s)]
*  So I just want to introduce that because, you know, diversity and equity and inclusion [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=32.12s)]
*  and fluffy words that are supposed to make you feel good, even though they're doing bad [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=36.56s)]
*  before they introduce the bait and the switch. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=40.32s)]
*  It's infuriating to watch your monologue. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=42.68s)]
*  It's infuriating to watch the monologue. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=44.36s)]
*  Look at all the crime. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=46.36s)]
*  Look at the statistics and look at the laws behind it, because you know what it makes [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=47.36s)]
*  me think? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=49.84s)]
*  You know what it makes the American people think? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=50.84s)]
*  The criminals are on the streets, but the worst criminals are in office. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=52.16s)]
*  They're voting on pieces of legislation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=55.4s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=56.64s)]
*  They're voting through pieces of policies that are harming the American people, and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=57.72s)]
*  they know it's harming the American people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=61.28s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=62.72s)]
*  The thing is they just don't care because they have armed guards, because they live [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=63.72s)]
*  behind gated communities, because they've sold out the American people. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=66.56s)]
*  We all knew this was going to come. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=70.36s)]
*  We voted these people into office, by the way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=71.84s)]
*  These are elected officials that stood on a platform and told you to defund the police [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=73.92s)]
*  because they had armed guards. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=77.6s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=79.16s)]
*  Of course we're seeing this consequence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=80.16s)]
*  We all saw it coming. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=81.68s)]
*  You spoke about it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  I spoke about it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  We were saying it ad nauseam. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=85.12s)]
*  Guys, please be aware that the Black Lives Matter narrative is a complete and utter lie. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=87.0s)]
*  And by the way, who is being harmed the most? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=90.72s)]
*  It's everybody. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=93.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter what your race is or your ethnicity or your gender, but who is being [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=94.0s)]
*  harmed the absolute most when you look at the numbers? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=96.6s)]
*  Of course it's black Americans, the very people that they purported to help when they had [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  first pushed out these policies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=102.24s)]
*  Oh, don't worry. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=103.72s)]
*  It's going to be great. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=104.72s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=105.72s)]
*  We're going to defund the police. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=106.72s)]
*  Like I said, it's infuriating. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=107.72s)]
*  I do want to say this to people that are watching, are still living in these inner communities [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=108.72s)]
*  in Democrat cities. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=113.0s)]
*  Get out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=114.56s)]
*  This is not a joke. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=115.56s)]
*  Don't wait for it to be you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=116.88s)]
*  Don't wait for it to be your child that you're pushing in a stroller when you get run over. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  Don't wait for it to be you that's going for a jog down the street and you're grabbed into [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=121.92s)]
*  a van and killed and you have two kids and you're my age like what happened to Eliza [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=126.0s)]
*  Fletcher in Memphis. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=129.92s)]
*  Do not wait for politicians to rescue you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=131.28s)]
*  Rescue yourself and get out of these Democrat controlled cities. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=133.8s)]
*  I think that's really good advice. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=136.68s)]
*  Candace Owens, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_JpGNguH0&t=139.68s)]
