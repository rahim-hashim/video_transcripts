# Marjorie Taylor Greene responds after sheâ€™s heckled for protesting Trump indictment
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g)
*  So it looked pretty crazy in New York yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=0.0s)]
*  And of course, looking crazy was the whole point of this, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=2.4s)]
*  to terrify swing voters into never voting for Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=4.2s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Well, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=8.4s)]
*  was there for the arraignment. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=10.48s)]
*  Before she arrived, the mayor of the city [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  already failed just a year into office. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Eric Adams described her as a criminal [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=16.0s)]
*  and implied he would punish her if she misbehaved. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, actual lunatics showed up [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=22.42s)]
*  and prevented her from speaking. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=24.64s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=26.04s)]
*  Sir, can I ask what those are for? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=27.72s)]
*  So we hear that Marjorie Taylor Greene is coming to the city [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=30.16s)]
*  right here, so we brought some whistles [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=34.04s)]
*  to hand out to people to drown her out with some noise. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=35.64s)]
*  That's a sitting member, an elected member of the Congress. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=53.04s)]
*  Everyone can see where this is going. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene joins us tonight [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=57.44s)]
*  to recount what she saw in New York yesterday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=63.08s)]
*  Well, it was absolute chaos, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=65.72s)]
*  and that's what the mayor of New York City [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  wanted to happen to me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  You see, he threatened me and basically put out [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=71.28s)]
*  a dog whistle for violence against me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  And then there was a funded text alert [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=76.84s)]
*  that went out naming me by name [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=78.9s)]
*  and telling people to do exactly what that man was doing, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=80.88s)]
*  hand out whistles and try to create a chaotic scene [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  of violence and assault. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  And that's against the law, by the way, Tucker. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=89.76s)]
*  You see, they didn't want me to be able to protest [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=92.2s)]
*  and use my First Amendment rights. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=94.44s)]
*  And they wanted violence. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=96.48s)]
*  I think they wanted that to happen [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=98.04s)]
*  because they want to repeat January 6th all over again. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  They want all of us, Trump supporters, MAGA, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  basically Republicans and just good Americans, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  to look like criminals. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=110.76s)]
*  And that's what they do in communist countries. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=112.12s)]
*  And that's actually what we're seeing today. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=114.28s)]
*  Well, the first thing to do, of course, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=116.92s)]
*  is take away your freedom to speak. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=117.88s)]
*  And if you can't say what you really think, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=119.52s)]
*  then you're not a free person, you're a slave. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=121.6s)]
*  And once you are, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=123.96s)]
*  then there's really nothing they can't do to you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=124.92s)]
*  Do you think people understand the implications [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=127.56s)]
*  of not allowing someone to speak? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=129.52s)]
*  I don't think they do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=133.4s)]
*  I don't think people realize [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=134.72s)]
*  what dangerous times we're living in. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=136.34s)]
*  You see, the Democrat Party, they're the fascists. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=138.3s)]
*  They want to cancel our voices. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=140.68s)]
*  They want to censor us. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=142.6s)]
*  And they want to completely force us into complying. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  You see, the reason why they're prosecuting, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=147.74s)]
*  or should we say persecuting, Donald Trump [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=149.88s)]
*  is for the crime of actually winning [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=152.56s)]
*  the 2016 presidential election. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  That's what they're in hysterics over. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=158.46s)]
*  And they've never gotten over it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=160.72s)]
*  But what they really want to do [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  is once they remove their top political opponent, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=164.10000000000002s)]
*  which is President Trump, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=166.66s)]
*  they're going to come after all of us. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=168.32s)]
*  This has happened repeatedly throughout history. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=170.08s)]
*  And people need to wake up [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=172.74s)]
*  to the reality of the danger we're living in. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=174.04s)]
*  Really quick, since you were just there, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=177.08s)]
*  but Mayor Adams described New York as, quote, his home. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=178.84s)]
*  How did his home look? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=181.48s)]
*  Pretty neat and tidy? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=182.48s)]
*  No, his home is disgusting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=185.04s)]
*  I compared it to what I called Gotham City. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=187.46s)]
*  The streets are filthy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=190.04s)]
*  They're covered with people, basically dying on drugs. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=191.4s)]
*  They can't even stand up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=195.04s)]
*  They're falling over. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=196.22s)]
*  There's so much crime in the city. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=197.4s)]
*  I can't comprehend how people live there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  It was repulsive. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  It smells bad. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=202.82s)]
*  And I just, I think it's a terrible place. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=204.33999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, with some nice people, I will say that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=207.33999999999997s)]
*  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=209.42s)]
*  just back from New York, thank you so much. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpsZIrSD5g&t=211.16s)]
