# Tucker: This is bizarre
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI)
*  Well, speaking of chaos, law enforcement has been suspended at our southern border, which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=0.0s)]
*  is wide open. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=3.88s)]
*  As a result, last month alone, U.S. officials reported nearly 200,000 illegal migrants at [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=4.88s)]
*  the border. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=10.36s)]
*  Those are just the ones they encountered. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=11.36s)]
*  By comparison, at the end of 2020, migrant encounters totaled just 72,000 per month. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=12.68s)]
*  Now, some of these people are using military-style camouflage to enter the country, which is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=17.48s)]
*  bizarre. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=22.2s)]
*  Fox's Matt Fin has that story for us tonight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=23.2s)]
*  Hey, Matt. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=26.6s)]
*  Hey, Tucker. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=27.6s)]
*  Illegal migrants use all types of methods to disguise or camouflage themselves. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=28.68s)]
*  Now, new pictures appear to show suspected illegal migrants wearing ghillie suits to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  blend into the desert. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=37.72s)]
*  Border patrol agents in the El Paso sector arrested the three migrants in southern New [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Mexico. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=43.68s)]
*  Ghillie is a type of camouflage material used to blend into various natural environments. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=44.84s)]
*  Military personnel, police and hunters use them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=49.56s)]
*  Fox News has reached out to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for more information [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=52.08s)]
*  on those pictures. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=55.92s)]
*  And these arrests come as this week the federal government announced there were 199,000 migrant [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  encounters at the border in July. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=62.6s)]
*  For comparison, at the end of 2020, migrant encounters were around 72,000 per month, now [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=64.92s)]
*  skyrocketing to nearly 200,000 last month, bringing the total number of encounters to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=70.6s)]
*  a record 1.94 million this fiscal year. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=75.68s)]
*  But sources tell Fox News that number is now over 2 million. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=79.04s)]
*  The Biden administration claims the number of encounters is inflated under Title 42 expulsions [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=82.92s)]
*  where migrants quickly cross back into the U.S. after being expelled under that COVID-19 [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=88.56s)]
*  order. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=93.88s)]
*  And as we have been reporting, states like Texas and Arizona are now moving migrants [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=94.88s)]
*  to other states and cities like Washington, D.C. and New York as a form of protest to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=98.92s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=104.44s)]
*  Tucker. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=105.44s)]
*  Matt Finn, thanks so much for that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=106.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es5X9jQX9cI&t=109.44s)]
