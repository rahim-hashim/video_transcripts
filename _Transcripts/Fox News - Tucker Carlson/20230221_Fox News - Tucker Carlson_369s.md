# Vivek Ramaswamy: I am running for US president
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE)
*  It's a question that entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=0.0s)]
*  has spent a great deal of time thinking about [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=2.36s)]
*  through two books, as well as in his latest venture, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=3.88s)]
*  which he joins us tonight to tell us about. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=6.48s)]
*  Vivek, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=9.6s)]
*  So it does seem like Don Lamon, you know, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=10.44s)]
*  just a cable host, but this is a perfect illustration [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=14.26s)]
*  of where identity politics wind up [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=16.72s)]
*  when you stray from universal principles [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=19.64s)]
*  that bind us all under the same rules. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=21.92s)]
*  Exactly, I mean, we are in the middle [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=24.48s)]
*  of this national identity crisis, Tucker, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=25.84s)]
*  where we have celebrated our diversity [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=27.92s)]
*  and our differences for so long [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  that we forgot all of the ways we're really just the same [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=32.22s)]
*  as Americans bound by a common set of ideals [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  that set this nation into motion 250 years ago. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=38.24s)]
*  And that's what I'm proud to say tonight [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  that I am running for United States president [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=42.56s)]
*  to revive those ideals in this country, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  those basic rules of the road, meritocracy, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=48.32000000000001s)]
*  the idea that you get ahead in this country, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=51.52s)]
*  not on the color of your skin, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=53.64s)]
*  but on the content of your character, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=55.28s)]
*  the idea that you are allowed to speak freely, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=57.12s)]
*  yes to be wrong sometimes, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  as long as your neighbor gets the same courtesy in return, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=60.64s)]
*  the idea that the people who we elect [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=63.4s)]
*  to run the government, by the way, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=64.86s)]
*  are the people who actually run the government. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=66.4s)]
*  Basic rules of the road, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=68.28s)]
*  these are the things that bind us together. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=69.64s)]
*  You and I have different shades of melanin, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=71.6s)]
*  you know what I say? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=73.12s)]
*  So what? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=73.96s)]
*  That's not beautiful, that is not our strength. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=74.9s)]
*  Our diversity is meaningless if there's nothing greater [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=77.36s)]
*  that binds us together across that diversity. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=80.12s)]
*  And the reason that I'm running for president [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=83.36s)]
*  is to revive those ideals, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=85.48s)]
*  and I believe deep in my bones they still exist, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=87.12s)]
*  that most Americans still believe in them, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  but we need to rediscover that, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=91.72s)]
*  and the only way we can do it [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  is by start talking openly again. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=94.16s)]
*  So I'm not gonna ask you any political questions [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=97.0s)]
*  because given my calls in the midterms, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  I don't understand American politics. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=100.44s)]
*  I'm not gonna ask you what you do in Iowa [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=101.72s)]
*  or other people can do that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=102.84s)]
*  Give us the bullet points [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=105.28s)]
*  of what you're going to tell audiences [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  as you embark from here on this campaign. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  I think we need to put merit back into America [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=110.74000000000001s)]
*  in every sphere of our lives. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=113.2s)]
*  Merit in who gets into this country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=115.16s)]
*  Let's start with that, okay? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=117.24s)]
*  I think more people like my parents [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=118.72s)]
*  can be a good thing for this country, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=120.76s)]
*  but people whose first act of entering this country [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=122.56s)]
*  as a law-breaking one, we should say a hard no to that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=124.84s)]
*  Not just who gets in, but also who gets ahead. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=127.48s)]
*  Decimating affirmative action. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=130.54s)]
*  It has been a national cancer. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=132.18s)]
*  One of my top priorities will be to end affirmative action [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  in every sphere of American life. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=136.9s)]
*  And it's not just meritocracy in who gets ahead. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=139.16s)]
*  Ending affirmative action. Yes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=141.64s)]
*  I mean, our whole government is based on that idea. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=142.96s)]
*  Well, the funny thing, Tucker, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  is this would be an easy thing for president to do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=145.88s)]
*  Lyndon Johnson issued an executive order [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=148.28s)]
*  that requires anyone who does business [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  with the U.S. government, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  that covers over 20% of the U.S. workforce [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  to adopt race-based quota systems. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=156.44s)]
*  Any Republican president since Lyndon Johnson [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=158.68s)]
*  could have taken a pen and crossed that out, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  we haven't done it yet. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=162.24s)]
*  I think that's the kind of courage [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=163.38s)]
*  we're gonna need to muster [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  to go after these sacred cows [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=165.52s)]
*  from woke religion in the form of affirmative action [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=167.36s)]
*  to this new climate religion, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=170.24s)]
*  which is completely shackling [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=171.44s)]
*  the American economy and culture. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=172.8s)]
*  We need to take the most sacred cows [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=174.56s)]
*  of these alternative secular religions, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=176.56s)]
*  and I'm sorry to say this, take them to the slaughterhouse, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=178.76s)]
*  because that's what it's gonna take [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=180.6s)]
*  for this national revival, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=182.6s)]
*  where we stop apologizing for what it means to be American. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=184.04s)]
*  I'm all for putting America first, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=187.18s)]
*  but in order to put America first, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  we have to first rediscover what America is. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=191.16s)]
*  And to me, those are these basic rules of the road [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=194.32s)]
*  that set this nation into motion, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=196.92s)]
*  from meritocracy to free speech, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=198.2s)]
*  to self-governance over aristocracy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  People who we elect actually make them run the government [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=203.0s)]
*  rather than this cancerous federal bureaucracy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=205.56s)]
*  That's gonna be the heart of my message. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=207.88s)]
*  And I'll tell you this, we don't have an option anymore. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay, we face these external threats, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=212.88s)]
*  like the rise of China, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=214.88s)]
*  which I think has got to be our top foreign policy threat [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=216.04s)]
*  that we've got to respond to, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  not pointless wars somewhere else. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=220.28s)]
*  That's gonna require some sacrifice. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=222.76s)]
*  It's gonna require a declaration of independence from China, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=224.33999999999997s)]
*  complete decoupling, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  and that's not gonna be easy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=229.84s)]
*  It's gonna require some inconvenience, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  buying cheap stuff for that many years. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=233.24s)]
*  You know what, we got addicted to it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=235.0s)]
*  That's gonna require some sacrifice. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=236.44s)]
*  But I think we can make those sacrifices [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  if we know what we are sacrificing for. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=240.8s)]
*  And that's what I wanna see the GOP do, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=243.52s)]
*  answer the question of what it means to be an American today. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  If we give an answer to that question, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  we dilute this woke agenda [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=250.44s)]
*  and these secular religions to irrelevance. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I've been complaining about them [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  for the last three years. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=255.52s)]
*  Yes, there's a role for identifying the problem, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=256.72s)]
*  but if we wanna deliver a solution, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=258.9s)]
*  we're gonna need to rediscover that national identity [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  that we all share. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=262.96s)]
*  And if we do that, I still think, honest, deep in my bones, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=263.97999999999996s)]
*  that our best days, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  not in some cheesy politician kind of way, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=268.82s)]
*  but actually, truly, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  I think our best days can be ahead of us, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=272.85999999999996s)]
*  but it's gonna take that revival to make it happen. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=275.23999999999995s)]
*  I hope you'll come back often [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  because you are one of the great talkers we've ever had. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=279.29999999999995s)]
*  But very quickly, you identified China [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  as the primary concern of American foreign policy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=285.46s)]
*  You don't think it's the war in Eastern Europe. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=288.22s)]
*  Absolutely correct. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=290.1s)]
*  And I think that, look, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=291.14s)]
*  foreign policy's all about prioritization. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  We gotta wake up to the fact [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  that China is violating our sovereignty, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=295.7s)]
*  and the reason, if that had been a Russian spy balloon, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=297.62s)]
*  we'd have shot it down instantly and ratcheted up sanctions. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=299.6s)]
*  Why didn't we do that for China? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=302.06s)]
*  The answer's simple. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=303.42s)]
*  We depend on them for our modern way of life. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=304.24s)]
*  This economic co-dependent relationship has to end, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=307.42s)]
*  and the only other priority I'd add is actually, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=309.66s)]
*  if you're gonna use the military for something, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=311.98s)]
*  use it to decimate the cartels south of the border [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=313.42s)]
*  in a failed narco state that's now actually [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=315.98s)]
*  killing people on American soil with fentanyl. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=318.3s)]
*  That's what a good use of a military looks like, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=320.62s)]
*  is actually protecting American soil and American interests, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  not a pointless war somewhere else. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=325.66s)]
*  And I think that the heart of this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=327.38s)]
*  goes to reviving that national identity. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  What does it mean to be American? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  Then you know what you need to defend, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=332.56s)]
*  and that's where our domestic policy vision [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=334.22s)]
*  and this cultural vision is inextricably linked. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=336.1s)]
*  It's tied to our foreign policy vision, too. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=339.1s)]
*  And that's why I'm running for president [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  because I think that needs to be [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=343.12s)]
*  at the top of the GOP's agenda. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=344.9s)]
*  I think it needs to be at the top of this country's agenda, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=346.94s)]
*  and I'm running for president to make it happen. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=349.06s)]
*  That is so far from the current agenda. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  That'll be fascinating to see you wade into this race, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  and we appreciate your announcing tonight here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwx1DT0-vrE&t=354.29999999999995s)]
