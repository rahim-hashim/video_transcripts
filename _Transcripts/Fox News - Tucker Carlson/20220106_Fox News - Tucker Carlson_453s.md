# Tucker presses Ted Cruz for using this term
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50)
*  So we played this tape for you last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=0.0s)]
*  We were surprised by it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=2.12s)]
*  We prefaced it by saying every conservative appreciates [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=3.52s)]
*  Ted Cruz because he's one of the smartest [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=6.36s)]
*  and most articulate people in the Congress, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=8.16s)]
*  and he's conservative. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=9.88s)]
*  But he referred publicly to what happened on January 6 [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=11.76s)]
*  as, quote, a violent terror attack. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=15.68s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=16.84s)]
*  We are approaching a solemn anniversary this week, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=19.28s)]
*  and it is an anniversary of a violent terrorist attack [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=23.2s)]
*  on the Capitol, where we saw the men and women [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=26.64s)]
*  of law enforcement demonstrate incredible courage, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=29.32s)]
*  incredible bravery, risk their lives [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=33.16s)]
*  to defend the men and women who serve in this Capitol. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=37.8s)]
*  Senator Cruz was game enough to come on tonight. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=41.64s)]
*  We appreciate that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=43.52s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=44.36s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=45.28s)]
*  So I guess what I mean, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=47.44s)]
*  there are a lot of dumb people in the Congress. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=48.56s)]
*  You're not one of them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=50.36s)]
*  I think you're smarter than I am. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=51.44s)]
*  And you never use words carelessly. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=53.32s)]
*  And yet you called this a terror attack [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=57.44s)]
*  when by no definition was it a terror attack. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=60.0s)]
*  That's a lie. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=62.36s)]
*  You told that lie on purpose, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=63.64s)]
*  and I'm wondering why you did. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=65.24s)]
*  Well, Tucker, thank you for having me on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=67.64s)]
*  when you aired your episode last night. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=69.4s)]
*  I sent you a text shortly thereafter and said, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=71.48s)]
*  listen, I'd like to go on because [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=73.68s)]
*  the way I phrased things yesterday, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=76.28s)]
*  it was sloppy and it was frankly dumb. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=77.96s)]
*  And as a result- I don't buy that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=80.64s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=82.32s)]
*  Look, I've known you a long time [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=83.16s)]
*  since before you went to the Senate. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=84.28s)]
*  You're a Supreme Court contender. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=85.68s)]
*  You take words as seriously as any man [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  who's ever served in the Senate. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  And every word you repeated that phrase, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  I do not believe that you used that accidentally. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=93.2s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  So Tucker, as a result of my sloppy phrasing, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=97.12s)]
*  it's caused a lot of people to misunderstand what I meant. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=99.92s)]
*  Let me tell you what I meant to say. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=102.56s)]
*  What I was referring to are the limited number of people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=105.04s)]
*  who engaged in violent attacks against police officers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=108.84s)]
*  Now I think you and I both agree [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=112.36000000000001s)]
*  that if you assault a police officer, you should go to jail. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=113.96s)]
*  That's who I was talking about. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  And the reason the phrasing was sloppy [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=118.88s)]
*  is I have talked dozens, if not hundreds of times. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=120.6s)]
*  I've drawn a distinction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=123.63999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't saying that the thousands of peaceful protesters [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  supporting Donald Trump are somehow terrorists. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=129.16s)]
*  I wasn't saying the millions of patriots [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=132.04s)]
*  across the country supporting President Trump are terrorists. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=135.04s)]
*  And that's what a lot of people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  have misunderstood that comment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=139.2s)]
*  Well, wait a second. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=140.04s)]
*  But even you- [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=140.88s)]
*  But hold on, what you just said doesn't make sense. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=141.72s)]
*  So if somebody assaults a cop, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=143.84s)]
*  he should be charged and go to jail. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=145.24s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=146.88s)]
*  We've said that for years. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  But that person's still not a terrorist. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=149.68s)]
*  How many people have been charged with terrorism [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=151.96s)]
*  on January 6th? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=154.28s)]
*  Like, why'd you use that word? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  You're playing into the other side's characterization [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=156.88s)]
*  that, as Joe Kent just explained, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=160.8s)]
*  allows them to define an entire population [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  as foreign combatants. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=165.8s)]
*  And you know that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=166.84s)]
*  So why'd you do it? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=167.68s)]
*  So Tucker, let me answer you directly. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=168.52s)]
*  The reason I used that word for a decade, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=169.96s)]
*  I have referred to people [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=172.88s)]
*  who violently assault police officers as terrorists. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=174.32s)]
*  I've done so over and over and over again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=176.8s)]
*  If you look at all the assaults we've seen [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=179.0s)]
*  across the country, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=180.68s)]
*  I've called that terrorism over and over again. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=181.8s)]
*  That being said, Tucker, I agree with you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=184.12s)]
*  It was a mistake to say that yesterday. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=185.88s)]
*  And the reason is what you just said, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=187.84s)]
*  which is we've now had a year of Democrats [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=189.68s)]
*  in the media twisting words [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=192.44s)]
*  and trying to say that all of us are terrorists, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  trying to say, you're a terrorist, I'm a terrorist. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=196.84s)]
*  And so, look, I don't like people who assault cops. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=199.4s)]
*  And I stand up and defend cops. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  And the reason I use that word [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=205.52s)]
*  is that's the word I've always used [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=208.32s)]
*  for people that violently attack cops. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  But in this context, I get why people were angry [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=212.32s)]
*  because we've had a year of the corrupt corporate media [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=215.88s)]
*  and Democrats claiming anyone [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=218.68s)]
*  who objected to the election fraud. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=221.36s)]
*  And by the way, remember what was happening [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  during those protests. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  Can I just ask, hold on, you work in the, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=227.56s)]
*  I guess I just don't believe you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  And I mean that with respect [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=231.8s)]
*  because I have such respect for your acuity [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  and your precision, and I've seen it on display. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=236.84s)]
*  I've covered you as a reporter. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  I know how you speak. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=240.36s)]
*  And you have sat there for a year [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=242.52s)]
*  and watched people use language [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=244.96s)]
*  to distort the events of that day, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=247.24s)]
*  intentionally, insurrection, coup, terrorism. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  Saying it's an insurrection is a political term. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=256.24s)]
*  It's a lie. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=258.6s)]
*  I've repeatedly denounced it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=259.44s)]
*  And when it comes to, look, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=262.0s)]
*  I was focusing on what I normally say. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=263.20000000000005s)]
*  What you aired was a little 15 second snippet. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  What I normally say is violence is wrong, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=267.92s)]
*  peaceful protest is right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  If you engage in violence, you should be prosecuted. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  If you're speaking, you have a right to speak. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=274.36s)]
*  I say that all the time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, I meant, and I agree. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=277.92s)]
*  So who's Ray Epps, by the way, since you are a Senator, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=279.88s)]
*  like he and this other guy are clearly encouraging the crowd [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=282.68s)]
*  to commit crimes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=287.24s)]
*  Neither one has been arrested or charged. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=289.16s)]
*  What is that, do you think? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  So I think that is a very good question. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't know who Ray Epps is. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  I've seen that video multiple times. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=297.6s)]
*  It's disturbing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=299.6s)]
*  He's clearly urging the crowd to violate the law. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  When you see the crowd start chanting Fed, Fed, Fed, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  for him to appear on the FBI's most wanted list [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=306.72s)]
*  and come off, it certainly suggests [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=309.04s)]
*  he was working for the FBI. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  That's not conclusive, but that's the obvious implication. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=312.88s)]
*  And the attorney general and the Department of Justice [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=316.0s)]
*  won't answer the question. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=318.48s)]
*  Tucker, I can tell you, I joined with a number [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=319.76s)]
*  of other senators trying to get the Biden DOJ [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  to answer the question, why so many January 6 prisoners [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=324.56s)]
*  are in solitary confinement? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  Why they're being treated so much worse [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=329.56s)]
*  than the Antifa rioters and the people who [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=332.0s)]
*  committed firebombing in a year of riots across the country? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=334.8s)]
*  And this Biden DOJ won't go after them. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  But let me also make a quick point, Tucker. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=342.24s)]
*  Remember, while thousands of people [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=343.92s)]
*  were standing up to defend this country on January 6th? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=346.6s)]
*  At that exact moment, I was standing on the Senate floor [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  objecting to the election results, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=352.52000000000004s)]
*  demanding that we impanel an election commission [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=354.76000000000005s)]
*  to consider evidence of voter fraud. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  And I brought together 11 senators to join me [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  in supporting getting to the bottom of that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=362.76000000000005s)]
*  So of course, it would be ridiculous [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=364.44s)]
*  for me to be saying that the people standing up [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=367.04s)]
*  and protesting to follow the law were somehow terrorists. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=369.76000000000005s)]
*  I was talking about people who commit violence against cops. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=373.84s)]
*  And you and I both agree, if you commit violence against cops, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=377.79999999999995s)]
*  you should go to jail. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=381.28s)]
*  Yeah, but you're not a terrorist. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=382.67999999999995s)]
*  You're not. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=384.44s)]
*  You're a guy who killed a guy who assaulted a cop. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=385.32s)]
*  OK, so there's a legal difference, as you well know, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=387.2s)]
*  better than I do, since you were actually [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  in the running for the Supreme Court. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=392.88s)]
*  And there's a moral difference between a guy who, you know. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=394.67999999999995s)]
*  The reason I use that word is for a decade, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  I've used that word for people that violently assault cops. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=399.88s)]
*  I use that word all in 2020 for the Antifa and BLM terrorists [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=402.92s)]
*  that assaulted cops in firebombed police cars. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=406.88s)]
*  But I agree, it was a mistake to use the word yesterday [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  because the Democrats and the corporate media [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=414.0s)]
*  have so politicized it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  They're trying to paint everyone as a terrorist, and it's a lie. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=418.36s)]
*  And by the way, I've spoken out vocally [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=422.12s)]
*  against your exchange you just had. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  They want to paint us as Nazis. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  I know, it's scary. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=427.68s)]
*  That is what they're trying to do. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=428.48s)]
*  And I just, look, I'm the one leading [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  the fight in the Senate against this garbage. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=432.2s)]
*  And it's what I have been doing, and it's [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  what I'll continue doing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, I appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=437.32s)]
*  Thank you very much, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr1m14NO50&t=438.92s)]
