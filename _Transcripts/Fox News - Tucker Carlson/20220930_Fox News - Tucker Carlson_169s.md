# Goya Foods CEO pins soaring food prices on 'evil' political leaders
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs)
*  Food prices, if you've been in the grocery store, you know, are continuing to climb. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=0.0s)]
*  Political leaders like Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren say it's got nothing to do with the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=3.54s)]
*  war in Europe or ESG or anything they did. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=7.88s)]
*  It has to do with greedy grocers who are getting rich. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=10.32s)]
*  Well, we almost never speak to the heads of big companies on the show because they won't [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=13.52s)]
*  come on. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=17.48s)]
*  But Bob Unanaway is the CEO of Goya Foods, one of the biggest food brands in the country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=18.48s)]
*  And we are grateful that he has been willing to join us tonight. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  Bob, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=24.96s)]
*  So you have heard you run this huge company and you have heard that you're the reason [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=27.44s)]
*  that food prices are up. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=31.8s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Not true, Tucker. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=36.88s)]
*  And thank you for your courage in speaking the truth. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=37.88s)]
*  And I would like to say our hearts, our prayers and our help because we are in Puerto Rico [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=40.8s)]
*  and Florida go out to the victims of Fiona and Ian. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=46.84s)]
*  At the core of inflation and it's out of control, especially in food, is evil. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=53.54s)]
*  Our desire to control us. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=59.98s)]
*  When I was a child, my parents said, never take candy from a stranger. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=63.08s)]
*  And they're giving out candy, incentivizing people not to work. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=67.34s)]
*  They're taking away our purpose, our spirit, our reason to get up every day. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=70.94s)]
*  And they're doing it without their own candy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  They're taking our candy and using it to incentivize us not to work. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  That's very inflationary. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  I think you're the only person I've heard say that, that this is an intentional effort [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=87.05999999999999s)]
*  to take people's purpose for living away, which is work, the act of creation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=92.69999999999999s)]
*  That's why we're alive. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=97.44s)]
*  Why does nobody say that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=98.78s)]
*  Well, you know, we were an essential business, Tucker. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=100.86s)]
*  We never stopped working. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=105.88s)]
*  Work is essential. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=108.02s)]
*  It gives us our reason. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=109.5s)]
*  You know, God, I love this gal from Maloney, from Italy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=110.78s)]
*  You know, she has this fascist speak God family country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  And you know, you need to have a purpose. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=120.33999999999999s)]
*  She says we all have our genetic code. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=124.82s)]
*  Each one of us is made in likeness of God with our own identity. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=127.22s)]
*  So we all have a purpose. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=132.5s)]
*  Now you take that purpose away by the very few who want to own us, enslave us, control [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=134.14s)]
*  us for their own greed and power. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=139.73999999999998s)]
*  Okay, I don't think I've ever heard a CEO of a big company talk that way. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  And I hope you won't mind if we bother you to come down and see you for a much longer [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=149.45999999999998s)]
*  interview. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=152.26s)]
*  Bob Unanoe of Goya, which I'm going to start eating tonight. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=153.26s)]
*  I appreciate your coming on today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=155.98s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  We'll be back with more interviews that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=164.1s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kc-4WizxGs&t=167.14s)]
