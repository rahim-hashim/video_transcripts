# J.D. Vance: 'Unless the government forces this on people, nobody is gonna go for it'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4)
*  J.D. Vance is running against Tim Ryan for a U.S. Senate seat this November. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=4.28s)]
*  J.D. Vance, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=5.28s)]
*  This seems like a completely crazed and fringe position. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=7.46s)]
*  Is it in Ohio? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=11.56s)]
*  I definitely think it is, Tucker. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=14.64s)]
*  You hit the nail on the head here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=16.44s)]
*  This is terrible for Ohio consumers. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=17.68s)]
*  People should be able to drive whatever car they want to because this is America and people [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=19.92s)]
*  have the freedom to choose. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=23.66s)]
*  This is a massive class war against Ohio auto workers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=26.44s)]
*  Why should we all be denied gas powered cars? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=31.16s)]
*  Why should Ohio auto workers be put out of a job because Tim Ryan's donors who own the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=33.72s)]
*  electric car companies want to get a little richer? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=38.44s)]
*  That's not representing the people of Ohio. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=41.94s)]
*  It's sure as hell not representing the interests of the middle class in Ohio. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=43.88s)]
*  And of course, that's not what Tim Ryan's interested in. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=46.84s)]
*  He's interested in representing his donors so they can continue to fund his fraudulent [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=48.92s)]
*  campaign. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=52.64s)]
*  Why is it always banning this, that, or the other thing? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=55.18s)]
*  I'm banning cigarettes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=57.78s)]
*  Anything that you enjoy, they're banning. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=59.5s)]
*  Why not just say I'm going to make a car that's so great you're going to want to buy it? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=61.14s)]
*  Isn't that kind of the American way? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=64.02s)]
*  Why does Tim Ryan go right to making it illegal? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=65.26s)]
*  Well he goes right to making it illegal because he knows that his preferred green energy fantasy [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=69.74s)]
*  that he'd like to project onto the entire state of Ohio won't happen through free choice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  He recognizes that unless the government forces this on people, nobody's going to go for it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=79.26s)]
*  And I have to say, Tucker, I mean this is why people need to support my campaign, JDVance.com, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=83.9s)]
*  because what he's doing is fundamentally trying to transform the country and it's going to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  make a lot of us poor if we let him do it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=93.14s)]
*  We can't let him do that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=95.3s)]
*  And he's pretending to be some kind of working man voice to the people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  I mean it's just so insulting if you listen to what he actually says. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=99.9s)]
*  JDVance, great to see you tonight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=103.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEDmhqV-m4&t=106.02000000000001s)]
