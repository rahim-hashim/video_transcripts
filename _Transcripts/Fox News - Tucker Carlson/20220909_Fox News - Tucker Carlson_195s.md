*  and we are happy to have her tonight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=21.28s)]
*  Sharon, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=22.68s)]
*  What a sweet and heartfelt line, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=25.04s)]
*  series of lines that was. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=29.52s)]
*  That reflects how you feel, obviously. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely it does. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=34.82s)]
*  I mean, I had the honor to meet the Queen many times. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  She, I mean, look at the woman [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=39.72s)]
*  has gone through in her life. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  She swore her oath to her country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  She has never put a foot wrong. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  She has put up with so much. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=48.96s)]
*  And, you know, there is nothing bad [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=52.88s)]
*  anyone could ever say about the woman. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=56.8s)]
*  It would be impossible. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=60.08s)]
*  She has served her country. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=60.92s)]
*  I don't think there's any disputing that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=64.72s)]
*  Is what you just said, is that a common view, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=67.0s)]
*  do you think, in the UK tonight? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=70.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=73.56s)]
*  I mean, talking to all my friends, my family, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=75.04s)]
*  everyone, everyone is in mourning for her majesty, everyone. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=79.0s)]
*  I hate even to ask this, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=85.08s)]
*  but what happens next with King Charles? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=86.56s)]
*  I adore him. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=92.68s)]
*  I think he is going to make a great king. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=94.12s)]
*  And, you know, he's been waiting a long time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=98.28s)]
*  He's, you know, he's been, he knows what he has to do. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=101.8s)]
*  How many years has he been watching his mother [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=106.92s)]
*  and learning from his mother and his father? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=110.04s)]
*  And I think he is going to stand in as king. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=113.48s)]
*  And I think that he will be a great king. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=116.56s)]
*  So you think the monarchy will continue? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=119.76s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=123.92s)]
*  I'm a royalist and I really, really hope so. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=129.72s)]
*  I had no idea you're a royalist. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=130.56s)]
*  And of course I have to ask you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=132.96s)]
*  because I can't control myself. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=134.68s)]
*  Meghan Markle, where does she fit in to all of this? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=136.2s)]
*  To the royal family. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=141.04s)]
*  Well, she doesn't. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=144.48s)]
*  So there were reports that she was not [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  participating in the mourning, is that true? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=148.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=151.88s)]
*  I honestly don't know. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=152.72s)]
*  But as far as the royal family are concerned, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  Harry and Meghan stepped back. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=157.68s)]
*  So as far as the future of the royal family, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=160.0s)]
*  I don't think that they will be of service [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  to their country or the Commonwealth [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=166.84s)]
*  because they chose to step back [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  and they do their own thing and that's it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they certainly do. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=174.32s)]
*  They do their own thing and that's nicely put. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  Sharon Osborne, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=179.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZpaBZP0sA&t=182.88s)]
