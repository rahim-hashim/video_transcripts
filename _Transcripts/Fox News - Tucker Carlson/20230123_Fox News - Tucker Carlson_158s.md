# Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene: Antifa are the ground troops of the Democrat party
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0)
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene represents Georgia in the Congress. She joins us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, this happened in your state. I'm just amazed by how little we know. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=4.44s)]
*  There's this militia that kind of floats around America, and when needed, they show up and start burning buildings [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=8.64s)]
*  and flipping over police cars, and no one knows who they are or who's paying for this. How can that be? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=14.84s)]
*  Well, Tucker, you laid it out just perfectly. And I think, honestly, America is sick and tired of Antifa. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Look at what they've done over years now. Just from 2020, they're responsible for nearly $2 billion in damage [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=25.48s)]
*  and many people dead. But the war is against the police, and the reason why is because Antifa is the ground troops [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=32.52s)]
*  of the Democrat Party. Not only are they the ground troops, they breed them, they raise them, and then they bail them out of jail [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=39.68s)]
*  when they get arrested. But they never get prosecuted. And that's because, well, we know the truth. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=47.04s)]
*  It's the Democrats in control, and it's the establishment and it's the unelected bureaucrats that make no apologies [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=53.16s)]
*  for their support of Antifa. Well, it's time to do something about Antifa, and that's why I'm going to introduce legislation [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=60.08s)]
*  to declare Antifa domestic terrorist, because they need to be taken apart. We need to investigate exactly who they are, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=67.24s)]
*  who funds them, and then we need to make sure that whenever they come out and erupt in violence, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=74.88s)]
*  attacking police officers and attacking businesses in cities like my city, Atlanta, in Georgia, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=81.64s)]
*  we need to make sure that they're arrested and charged with domestic terrorism charges, just like the GBI did this past weekend. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=89.24s)]
*  Enough of Antifa. They are not the anti-fascists. They are the fascists, and they always show up and they defend Democrat causes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=96.36s)]
*  Not only do they attack police, but they defend the drag queens targeting our children with drag queens story time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=106.76s)]
*  They go after people when they're not vaccinated and demand they get vaccinated and wear masks during the so-called pandemic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=113.24s)]
*  But enough of Antifa. We've had it with them, and it's time to do something about it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=120.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was kind of a tell, I would say. This is the anarchist group that's for vax mandates. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=125.56s)]
*  Tell me how that works. Is that in the anarchist catechism? Vax mandates? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=131.72s)]
*  Yeah, just like they're environmentalists trying to stop a police training center. We're not buying it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=136.76000000000002s)]
*  It's too funny. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, thank you so much. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=143.12s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw4UI6pew0&t=145.92000000000002s)]
