# Tucker: This is who Mitch McConnell truly is
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ)
*  If you don't live in D.C., you probably unheard the name, but Tim Eunice is a Republican event [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=0.0s)]
*  planner in Washington. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=7.28s)]
*  For 25 years, he helped organize appearances for Senator Bob Dole and his wife, Senator [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=8.64s)]
*  Elizabeth Dole. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=13.0s)]
*  He was close to the family. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=14.0s)]
*  When Bob Dole died last week, Eunice was the obvious choice to manage the funeral and the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=16.04s)]
*  memorial service, and he would have done that if Mitch McConnell hadn't gotten personally [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=20.28s)]
*  involved. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Now, technically, Mitch McConnell is the Republican leader of the United States Senate, but in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  real life, and everyone in Washington knows this, on the issues that matter, Mitch McConnell [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=29.16s)]
*  is an instrument of the left. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=33.76s)]
*  McConnell knew that Tim Eunice had helped organize Donald Trump's political rally in Washington [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=36.84s)]
*  this January. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=41.52s)]
*  Now, there's nothing illegal or immoral about doing that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=42.52s)]
*  If anything is constitutionally protected behavior, it's organizing a political rally. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=45.28s)]
*  It's why we have the Bill of Rights. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  But the partisan lunatics on the January 6th committee don't acknowledge the Bill of Rights, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=51.92s)]
*  and they objected to this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=55.68s)]
*  And then Mitch McConnell aggressively took their side, as he has from the very beginning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=57.56s)]
*  So McConnell then convinced the Dole family to cancel Tim Eunice's contract and disinvite [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=63.0s)]
*  him from the funeral. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=68.2s)]
*  Then McConnell made sure the story made the New York Times. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=70.16s)]
*  And when he did that, he knew perfectly well that a piece like this would completely destroy [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=73.04s)]
*  Tim Eunice's life, which unfortunately, it definitely will. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=77.36s)]
*  It will mean no more corporate clients, no more business, no more income for Tim Eunice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=81.64s)]
*  So even by Mitch McConnell's usual standards of viciousness, and in Washington he's known [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=88.44s)]
*  as the nastiest old woman in town, this was an incredibly cruel thing to do. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=93.4s)]
*  It was crushing the weak on behalf of the strong, and for no real reason, simply because [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=100.54s)]
*  he could and doesn't like Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=105.8s)]
*  Now this is hardly the first time Mitch McConnell has done something vicious like this, but [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  we thought that going forward, we would start telling you about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  Because why wouldn't we? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah6EeS7-5AQ&t=116.25999999999999s)]
