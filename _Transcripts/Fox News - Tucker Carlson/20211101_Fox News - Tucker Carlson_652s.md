# Tucker: Who is spreading hate in America?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8)
*  Tomorrow is election day and off-year election in the state of Virginia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=0.0s)]
*  Glenn Miller is an attorney from McLean right across the river from Washington. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=3.04s)]
*  Like most lawyers in the D.C. suburbs, he's a loyal Democrat. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=7.68s)]
*  In 2016, he voted for Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=10.76s)]
*  Last fall, he voted for Joe Biden. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  And yet tomorrow, he says, he's voting for the Republican Glenn Youngkin [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=14.96s)]
*  in the Virginia governor's race. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=18.52s)]
*  At a Youngkin rally over the weekend, he explained why. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=20.36s)]
*  The tipping point, Miller told the New York Times, came one day as he was working [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  and heard his teenage daughter's teacher make a comment during a virtual lesson [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=27.8s)]
*  about white men as modern-day slaveholders. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=31.96s)]
*  For Glenn Miller, this was too much. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=35.16s)]
*  There are a lot of people like me, Miller said, who are annoyed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=37.84s)]
*  Yeah, and annoyed for good reason. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=40.92s)]
*  In Virginia, as in the rest of the country, Democrats have been yammering about race [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=43.28s)]
*  nonstop, specifically about the dangerous racism of white people, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=46.96s)]
*  literally without ceasing for the last year and a half. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=51.08s)]
*  It's all they talk about. It's a kind of monomania. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=54.28s)]
*  Not surprisingly, therefore, questions about race have dominated [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=57.16s)]
*  the Virginia governor's election. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=60.0s)]
*  And in a normal year, that would seem odd. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  In this case, both candidates are white, and the state they're hoping to run [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=64.08s)]
*  doesn't, objectively speaking, have a lot of race problems. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=67.56s)]
*  Virginians of all colors tend to get along pretty well, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=70.84s)]
*  as they do nearly everywhere in America, no matter what they tell you on CNN. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=73.44s)]
*  And yet, listening to Terry McAuliffe, who's the Democratic nominee, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  you get the impression it's 1855 in Richmond. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=80.52s)]
*  As we speak, human beings are being auctioned downtown. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=83.36s)]
*  In Terry McAuliffe's telling, nothing has changed in Virginia. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=86.92s)]
*  And so for months, McAuliffe has offered a one-word explanation [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=90.8s)]
*  for virtually every question he's been asked. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=93.52s)]
*  And the answer, of course, is racism. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=95.2s)]
*  Whatever Terry McAuliffe doesn't like is racist. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=97.6s)]
*  Seriously, terrifyingly racist, like slavery. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=100.8s)]
*  On the other hand, whatever Terry McAuliffe does like, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=104.6s)]
*  such as accumulating more personal power for himself, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=107.36s)]
*  is by definition the answer to racism. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=110.4s)]
*  In fact, the only answer. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=112.92s)]
*  It's a very simple and very familiar formula. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=114.6s)]
*  It's also incredibly divisive, not to mention stupid and tiresome. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  The question tomorrow is, are Virginia voters finally fed up with this garbage? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  Does the race card still work? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Is there a single sane person who believes that white racism [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=128.04s)]
*  is the root of all of the state's problems? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=131.24s)]
*  We're going to find out tomorrow. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=133.6s)]
*  Polls suggest that McAuliffe is going to lose this race. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=135.56s)]
*  And if he does, there's going to be an earthquake within the Democratic Party. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=138.2s)]
*  Terry McAuliffe was the governor of Virginia just four years ago. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=141.6s)]
*  Joe Biden won the state by 10 points last November. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=144.52s)]
*  The most famous Democrats on the planet, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=148.16s)]
*  from the sitting president, Joe Biden, to the former president, Barack Obama, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=150.44s)]
*  to Kamala Harris herself, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=153.52s)]
*  have personally campaigned for Terry McAuliffe in the state of Virginia. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=155.68s)]
*  So the Democratic Party has left nothing on the table. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  And there's a reason for that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=162.44s)]
*  Democrats understand this election is a referendum, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=163.96s)]
*  not simply on an amoral sleazeball who wants to be the governor again for some reason, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=166.12s)]
*  but a referendum on the performance of our entire leadership class, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  a referendum on them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=173.68s)]
*  It didn't have to be this way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=176.12s)]
*  If Terry McAuliffe had been wise enough to keep this race non-ideological, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  he would without question have won it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=182.0s)]
*  Widen the highways. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=183.96s)]
*  Fix 66. Lower the car tax. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=185.4s)]
*  Shorten your commute to work. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=187.4s)]
*  Make Dulles Airport slightly less horrible. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=189.4s)]
*  Who wouldn't vote for those things? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=192.0s)]
*  But no, instead of promising to improve the lives of the people who live in Virginia, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  McAuliffe instead found himself defending Joe Biden's lunatic, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  openly racist equity agenda, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=202.12s)]
*  something that unless you're directly benefiting from it as a consultant, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=204.6s)]
*  you probably hate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=208.56s)]
*  The equity agenda is rooted in hostility and hatred. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=210.36s)]
*  It is immoral. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=213.44s)]
*  And on some level, most people understand that perfectly well. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=214.32s)]
*  And yet here was Terry McAuliffe live on television, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=217.4s)]
*  explaining that parents who insist on having a role in their own children's education [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=220.32s)]
*  must be white supremacists. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=225.12s)]
*  People trust me on education, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=226.8s)]
*  But it's at the forefront here in Virginia, as it now is in others. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=228.84s)]
*  You see what's happening in Georgia and Florida [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  because they're talking about this critical race theory. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=234.44s)]
*  And as I said before, and I'll say it again, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=237.08s)]
*  it's never been taught in Virginia. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  And I really hate it because it's a racist dog whistle. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=240.96s)]
*  Terry McAuliffe never recovered from that interview, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=246.44s)]
*  and the polls showed it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  And he didn't recover because what he said was a lie, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  and everyone with school-aged children in Virginia knew it was a lie. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  And if you're interested, take a look at the Virginia Department of Education's website [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=255.52s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=258.44s)]
*  That's from a book the state of Virginia recommends. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=269.08s)]
*  That book goes on to instruct teachers to avoid phrases like [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=271.84s)]
*  work hard or be nice, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=274.52s)]
*  because those are expressions of white settler colonialism. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  There are other examples of this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=280.28s)]
*  The Virginia Department of Education also promotes [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=282.32s)]
*  formerly known as Henry Rogers. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=285.48s)]
*  Kendi has gotten quite rich by inflaming the masochism of affluent white liberals, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=288.48s)]
*  the people who love to be told they're powerful and naughty [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=292.56s)]
*  as they send their kids to private school. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  It tells you how low their standards are [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=298.12s)]
*  that Ibram Kendi has done all of this despite being stupid. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  How stupid? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  This is an actual tweet Kendi sent over the weekend. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=304.48s)]
*  Oh. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=314.48s)]
*  So in other words, Ibram X. Kendi is telling us [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=315.48s)]
*  America is such a white supremacist country [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=318.48s)]
*  that white kids can't even get into college without pretending not to be white. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=321.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=326.48s)]
*  So eventually, gears turning slowly, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=327.48s)]
*  Kendi realized the tweet might not be helping his case, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=329.48s)]
*  and so he deleted it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=332.48s)]
*  But the point remains, these are the people providing the education [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=334.48s)]
*  that they need to be able to do their job. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=337.48s)]
*  And that's why he's been called the white supremacist. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=339.48s)]
*  Which means these are the people providing the education to children in Virginia. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=342.48s)]
*  And if you live there, that's a problem, even if you're a Democrat. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=347.48s)]
*  So no wonder Glenn Youngkin is winning. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=350.48s)]
*  It's all too much. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=352.48s)]
*  And yet interestingly, weirdly, Terry McAuliffe has not corrected course. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=353.48s)]
*  He has instead doubled down on this stuff, which again, no one really likes. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=357.48s)]
*  At a campaign event just last night, McAuliffe told the crowd [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=361.48s)]
*  that he's identified the actual problem in Virginia schools, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=364.48s)]
*  and you'll never guess what it is. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=367.48s)]
*  It's too many white teachers. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=369.48s)]
*  And we've got to work hard to diversify our teacher base. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=370.48s)]
*  50% of our students are students of color. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=373.48s)]
*  80% of the teachers are white. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=375.48s)]
*  Now to his credit, McAuliffe's opponent, Glenn Youngkin, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=379.48s)]
*  who has really improved with every day of this campaign, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=381.48s)]
*  as people do sometimes in these campaigns, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=383.48s)]
*  has called this kind of rhetoric for what it is. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=385.48s)]
*  It's a racial attack. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=387.48s)]
*  It's also an assault on the founding principles of the United States. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=389.48s)]
*  Which to sum up, is the Christian belief that all people, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=392.48s)]
*  regardless of their skin color, are equal before God. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=396.48s)]
*  But friends, let me be clear. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=400.48s)]
*  One of the things we're not going to do in our schools [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=401.48s)]
*  is teach our children to view everything through a lens of race. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=403.48s)]
*  We know it's not right. We know in our heart. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=406.48s)]
*  I mean, we're all one body of Christ. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=408.48s)]
*  How in the world can we teach our children to be divided up into buckets [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=410.48s)]
*  with one group being privileged and another group being victims? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=413.48s)]
*  That's just not right. It steals their dreams. We know that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=416.48s)]
*  So let me just be clear. On day one, I will ban critical race theory. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=419.48s)]
*  It will not be in our schools. It just won't. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=422.48s)]
*  Well, exactly. Nicely put. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=426.48s)]
*  I mean, these ideas aren't just annoying. They're poison. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=428.48s)]
*  And they end with Rwanda. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=431.48s)]
*  And anyone who thinks it through understands that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=432.48s)]
*  If you wanted to unite the country, which badly needs to be united, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=434.48s)]
*  you would emphasize our equality of value. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=437.48s)]
*  We may be different in many ways, and we are. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=440.48s)]
*  But we are all worth the same. Period. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=443.48s)]
*  And anyone who doesn't believe that should not be within a hundred yards of power ever. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=446.48s)]
*  Unfortunately for the rest of us, the racial unity message, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=451.48s)]
*  which we so badly need, does not get Democrats elected. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=454.48s)]
*  So last week, Democrats in Virginia concocted yet another fake race hoax [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=457.48s)]
*  to make voters hate each other and increase their electoral advantage. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=461.48s)]
*  Democratic political operatives posing as neo-Nazis showed up outside a Glen Youngkin event carrying torches. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=464.48s)]
*  They stayed long enough to be photographed by a credulous local reporter. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=470.48s)]
*  And then Terry McAuliffe's campaign team circulated pictures of those alleged white supremacists [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=473.48s)]
*  claiming they were Youngkin supporters. He's a racist! [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=478.48s)]
*  Many members of the media did the same, of course. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=482.48s)]
*  And then, within hours, the lie collapsed. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=484.48s)]
*  And that's when we learned that the Lincoln Project was, or they said they were, behind this. Watch. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=487.48s)]
*  You're getting crushed by people on the right as a dirty tactic. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=493.48s)]
*  Do you stand behind what was done, and is that being what you guys say you oppose? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=497.48s)]
*  No. Listen, every day I hear people pleading with the Lincoln Project [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=503.48s)]
*  to help show Democrats how to win, how to play hardball. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=508.48s)]
*  You know, this is an example. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=513.48s)]
*  So they've told us for 10 months that January 6th was a Nazi rally. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=517.48s)]
*  There are Nazi rallies everywhere. It's a lie. There aren't. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=521.48s)]
*  There aren't any Nazi rallies in this country, ever, because there's not that much racism in this country, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=524.48s)]
*  because it's a really nice country. But they have to tell us that there are. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=528.48s)]
*  And at this point, they had to make one up. So they staged a fake Nazi rally. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=531.48s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself, who's spreading hate in America? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=536.48s)]
*  Well, they are. And then you've got to wonder, under the current rules, to which we're all subject, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=540.48s)]
*  why is the Lincoln Project still on Twitter and Facebook? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=545.48s)]
*  Has Bank of America closed its accounts on moral grounds, as they've done to so many people on the right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=549.48s)]
*  Are these creeps at the Lincoln Project, some of whom apparently covered for their child molester colleague, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=554.48s)]
*  are they still allowed on PayPal and GoFundMe? Of course they are. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=559.48s)]
*  Have their donors been doxxed and exposed and driven from their jobs and their homes? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=562.48s)]
*  No. Some of their biggest endowners include Hollywood film producer David Geffen. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=567.48s)]
*  He's given them a half a million dollars. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=571.48s)]
*  Hollywood film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg has given them a hundred grand. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=573.48s)]
*  Gordon Getty, son of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, has donated a million dollars to the Lincoln Project. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=576.48s)]
*  All of these people are funding a group that staged a Nazi rally and blamed their political opponent [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=581.48s)]
*  and then didn't have the decency to apologize for it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=588.48s)]
*  Now that's a story, but it's not being covered. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=591.48s)]
*  Instead, the media spent the weekend obsessing over whether a Southwest Airlines pilot [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=595.48s)]
*  may or may not have offended Joe Biden over the PA system and if so, put that man in jail. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=599.48s)]
*  So they're trying their best, at every level they are trying their best, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=604.48s)]
*  to drag professional sleazeball Terry McAuliffe across the finish line in Virginia. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=608.48s)]
*  And despite all these efforts, the lying, the misdirection, a lot of people in the state, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=612.48s)]
*  and not just Republicans, realize what's actually happening and who's behind it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=616.48s)]
*  Tomorrow they can send a very clear signal to the people doing it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=621.48s)]
*  Stop dividing us by race. Stop indoctrinating our school children to hate us. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=624.48s)]
*  Stop treating parents like domestic terrorists. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=629.48s)]
*  This is not about whether a Republican or a Democrat wins tomorrow. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=632.48s)]
*  This is about where we go from here as a country. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro86-LOuzI8&t=636.48s)]
