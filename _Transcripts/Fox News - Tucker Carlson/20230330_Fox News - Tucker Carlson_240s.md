# Adam Carolla: The left views Trump as Satan
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw)
*  Hard to believe what's happening in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=0.0s)]
*  We thought we'd check in with the man [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=2.0s)]
*  on the leading edge of America in the city of Los Angeles, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=4.12s)]
*  which is always ahead of national trends, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=7.74s)]
*  a lifelong resident city, Adam Carolla. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=9.24s)]
*  We always see when we're in town, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=11.24s)]
*  host of the Adam Carolla Show, to put this into perspective. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=12.44s)]
*  Adam, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  So what's your view of what we're watching? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=16.62s)]
*  Well, it's fine. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=18.38s)]
*  Sorry, I don't have any new thoughts [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=20.72s)]
*  because your 200 guests before me, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  I think, encapsulated every thought [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=25.04s)]
*  you could possibly have about this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=27.1s)]
*  But like Whitlock said, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=28.9s)]
*  I think there's a religious angle to this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=31.18s)]
*  I think they, on the left, that is a religion, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=33.66s)]
*  and I think they look at Trump as Satan. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=37.46s)]
*  And if you gotta get rid of Satan and or Hitler, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=40.54s)]
*  then you just do what you gotta do. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=43.94s)]
*  God is on your side. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  So there's a kind of- [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=47.94s)]
*  You feel that, right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=48.78s)]
*  I mean, I feel that too. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  I don't think I'm imagining it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  Well, it is like- [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  This isn't politics, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=52.86s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome feels like [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=53.78s)]
*  the kind of anger you would have against a religion [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=57.06s)]
*  and a religious leader who didn't agree with your religion, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=61.38s)]
*  and then you need to take them down, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=65.34s)]
*  incarcerate them, whatever it is. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  And so the rule book is out the window [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=69.98s)]
*  when you're dealing with Satan or Hitler [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=72.88s)]
*  or Beelzebub or whoever. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=74.66s)]
*  So I think there's that element to it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=75.9s)]
*  The other one is kind of interesting, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=78.06s)]
*  which is we make proclamations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=79.78s)]
*  Like Merrick Garland says, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=82.1s)]
*  white supremacy is the biggest problem this country faces [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=84.22s)]
*  and the most dangerous this country faces. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=87.66s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=88.5s)]
*  And everyone laughs at him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=89.34s)]
*  And then he goes out and finds it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=90.18s)]
*  So then he goes and arrests parents [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=92.26s)]
*  at Virginia School Board meetings, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=94.6s)]
*  So it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=96.78s)]
*  So they're gonna turn Trump into a martyr. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=99.78s)]
*  People are gonna go out and protest. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=103.06s)]
*  Somebody's gonna do something stupid, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=105.66s)]
*  and then they're gonna fire up the DOJ, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=108.38s)]
*  just like January 6th, but outside now, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=111.34s)]
*  and snap into action. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=116.06s)]
*  So they make proclamations, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=117.74s)]
*  and then they need to find the crime, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=119.58s)]
*  and then we'll find this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=121.42s)]
*  So certainly, people are gonna push back. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  Someone's gonna do something stupid or not. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=126.08s)]
*  CNN, MSNBC, the Yents is from the View, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=129.34s)]
*  they're all gonna blow it up into this, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=132.5s)]
*  and then the stormtroopers come in. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=134.74s)]
*  So it does feel like the population [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  is being pushed into a corner for a reason. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=139.14s)]
*  I'm not just imagining that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=141.42s)]
*  I feel like it's to get them to react [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=143.26s)]
*  so that the government can now swoop in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=146.17999999999998s)]
*  and do a self-fulfilling prophecy, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=149.38s)]
*  because everybody who reacts to this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=151.7s)]
*  is gonna be a white supremacist. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=154.06s)]
*  And remember, we told you that white supremacy [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=155.98s)]
*  is the biggest problem this country faces. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=158.1s)]
*  How long can they scream at whites [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=160.18s)]
*  before that just becomes ineffective? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=161.54s)]
*  It's like I've said a million times, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  there's never been a better time to be called a racist. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=166.85999999999999s)]
*  You could just be lumped in with everyone else [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=169.76s)]
*  in this country, anyone who voted Republican. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=172.1s)]
*  And to your other point, I think the only way this stops [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=174.66s)]
*  is if LeBron James and the Obamas and the View ladies [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=178.42s)]
*  and Joe Scarborough, if people start speaking up, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=182.68s)]
*  not people on the right, people on the left. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=186.78s)]
*  You need some sane cultural leader [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=189.54s)]
*  who's an athlete or Oprah or someone of that nature [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=192.74s)]
*  to start going, look, I don't like Trump, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  but I love the country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=198.94s)]
*  This isn't right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=200.26s)]
*  We need to do something. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=201.6s)]
*  Because aren't you supposed to settle it in your elections? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=202.44s)]
*  Isn't that how a democracy works? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=205.92s)]
*  You don't like Trump, okay, fine, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=207.4s)]
*  then you get to vote against him, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=208.32s)]
*  I thought that was the system. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=210.24s)]
*  But what if Joe Biden was running against the devil? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  Then how would you want to settle it? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  No, you're exactly right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=216.2s)]
*  Well, then you need to get the angels of the Lord in there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=217.44s)]
*  Alvin Bragg. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=220.44s)]
*  You did add a lot, by the way, even after our 100 guests. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=223.4s)]
*  Adam Kroll, it's wonderful to see you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=227.04s)]
*  Good to see you, Tanka. Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=228.56s)]
*  And don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9e-U-xegIw&t=231.6s)]
