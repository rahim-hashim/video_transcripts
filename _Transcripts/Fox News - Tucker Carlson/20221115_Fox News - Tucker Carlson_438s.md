# Buck Sexton reacts to NBC reporter suspended over Paul Pelosi attack reportage
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM)
*  But a little bit earlier in the show, I mentioned Paul Pelosi. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, there's more confusion about what happened inside Nancy Pelosi's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=3.38s)]
*  house on October 28th. Now, if you remember, that's when nudists, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=7.72s)]
*  a nudist named David DePapp attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=11.48s)]
*  Now, according to a federal indictment by the federal department of justice, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=15.48s)]
*  police officers opened the door to Nancy Pelosi's home. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=20.76s)]
*  Now this is fascinating because it's in direct contradiction to the filing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=25.1s)]
*  by San Francisco district attorney and local law enforcement who say that no, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=30.12s)]
*  in fact, Paul Pelosi opened the door. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=34.4s)]
*  An NBC news affiliate in the Bay area just reported that according to law [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=37.76s)]
*  enforcement sources who saw body cam footage, the DA is right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=43.94s)]
*  The DOJ is wrong. Paul Pelosi opened the door. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Now why is this important? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=53.64s)]
*  Because asking for details or facts when it comes to this story have again been [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=55.04s)]
*  dismissed as a conspiracy, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=58.84s)]
*  as an entire narrative that David DePapp was an insurrectionist and a MAGA [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  Republican was built. No questions that could get in the way of that narrative. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=65.16s)]
*  For example, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  this isn't the first time that NBC news contradicted the DOJ's narrative. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  Earlier this month, NBC ran this report, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  which stated that Paul Pelosi didn't think he was in danger when David DePapp [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  was in his home. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=83.84s)]
*  Sources familiar with what unfolded in the Pelosi residence now revealing when [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  officers responded to the high priority call, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=90.64s)]
*  they were seemingly unaware they'd been called to the home of the speaker of the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=93.56s)]
*  house. After a knock and announce, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=97.48s)]
*  the front door was opened by Mr. Pelosi. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  The 82 year old did not immediately declare an emergency or tried to leave his [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=102.84s)]
*  home, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=108.04s)]
*  but instead began walking several feet back into the foyer toward the assailant [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=108.68s)]
*  and away from police. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=113.92s)]
*  Why Pelosi didn't try to flee or tell responding officers he was in distress is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=115.64s)]
*  unclear. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=121.4s)]
*  We still don't know exactly what unfolded between Mr. Pelosi and the suspect for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  the 30 minutes they were alone inside that house before police arrived. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=126.56s)]
*  Now that report by NBC news that seems to at least be in part supported by the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=131.32s)]
*  new investigative report from an NBC affiliate in the Bay area was totally [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  scrubbed from its website. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=141.28s)]
*  They also suspended that reporter Miguel Almaguer. He has not been heard from, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=143.44s)]
*  no tweets, no appearances on television for almost two weeks. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=147.68s)]
*  NBC claims that Almaguer violated their standards. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=152.2s)]
*  What standards were those? See, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=156.84s)]
*  no NBC reporters were ever suspended for the lies that they told in helping the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  democratic party. Watch. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=164.24s)]
*  Right-wing media has been focused on Hunter Biden. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=166.64s)]
*  This laptop that intelligence officials have warned is likely Russian [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  disinformation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  The story is preposterous, right? The story is preposterous. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=174.84s)]
*  So we're supposed to believe that Hunter Biden and a drunken stupor dropped off [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=178.16s)]
*  his laptop and I guess apparently QAnon repair office. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  It is so obviously a Russian operation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=188.32s)]
*  This looks like Russian intelligence. This walks like Russian intelligence. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=191.72s)]
*  This talks like Russian intelligence. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=196.2s)]
*  This effort by Julie Giuliani and the New York Post and Steve Bannon to cook up [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=198.08s)]
*  supposed dirt on Joe Biden looks like a classic Russian [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  playbook disinformation campaign. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=207.84s)]
*  That all of those lies, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  all of that misinformation was apparently up to NBC standards. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=212.52s)]
*  This report that we now know or suggest is true below NBC standards. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=216.24s)]
*  You can see him on the screen. He's Buck Sexton. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=221.0s)]
*  He's the host of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. And he joins us now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=222.56s)]
*  Buck's also a former CIA officer. Buck, help me make sense of this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=226.04s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=229.96s)]
*  Well, you know, Will, I think it's pretty straightforward. This is yet again, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=231.8s)]
*  the American people being shown what the rules of so-called journalism are. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=235.52s)]
*  Liars get Pulitzers and truth tellers get fired or in this case suspended [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=240.0s)]
*  because it's all about activism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=245.2s)]
*  It's all about support of the partisan narrative in the moment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=246.88s)]
*  I mean, as a former intelligence officer watching those clips of people saying [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=250.4s)]
*  that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=254.4s)]
*  There's not much left of the Intel community these days in terms of reputation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=257.36s)]
*  to protect, but they were certainly trying to destroy it there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=260.48s)]
*  And they did a good job of it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=263.56s)]
*  We see this time and time again where even if eventually the truth comes out, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=265.0s)]
*  there's no punishment. I mean, we didn't even get into Russia collusion, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=270.2s)]
*  for example, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  where the entire Democrat aligned corporate media spent four years. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=274.24s)]
*  They still say it's kind of true in some ways. You ask them how, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=278.24s)]
*  they don't really ever explain it. But Will, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=280.88s)]
*  they understand that these are actually the rules. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=282.88s)]
*  This is what we are dealing with. This is not a bug. This is a feature. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  This is the desire of the Democrats to use the biggest media outlets they [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=288.2s)]
*  possibly can to tell the most important lies, the biggest lies, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=292.64s)]
*  or even just suppress the truth in moments of peril for their power. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=296.56s)]
*  And we saw that with the Hunter Biden laptop and with the Nancy Pelosi story, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=301.12s)]
*  I would just point out Paul Pelosi story. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=304.92s)]
*  The security situation alone is worthy of a serious deep dive. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=307.04s)]
*  How is it that this guy, if he was invited in or wasn't invited in, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=311.64s)]
*  was able to attack Nancy Pelosi's husband, the police response, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=315.8s)]
*  all of this should be something that journalists want to know right away, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=318.88s)]
*  but they're trying to slow walk this because they know that there was a story [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  to tell at the time to help Democrats in an election. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=326.36s)]
*  And that was all that mattered. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  There was a story to tell. Are you referencing there, Buck, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  the entire narrative, this ornate narrative that was built upon a foundation, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=333.88s)]
*  that David DePapp was a MAGA Republican and somehow therefore this is connected [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=338.64s)]
*  to January 6th. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=342.44s)]
*  That was the narrative that was built with very few facts to support it [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=344.0s)]
*  underneath. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  And now we understand that if you ask for facts, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=348.64s)]
*  facts which are now coming forward to try to clarify what is the story, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  you're guilty of conspiracy. No need to make an affirmative case, right? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=355.32s)]
*  Simply questioning the facts makes you guilty of a conspiracy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. What you've seen here, Will, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  is that they will actually weaponize the most basic principles of fact [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=364.72s)]
*  finding and what's supposedly journalism against people. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=369.32000000000005s)]
*  You asked the question and you're the bad guy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=372.6s)]
*  And we just saw in the horrific tragedy of Uvalde, for example, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  police initially were lying. The reports initially were entirely false. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  And there was a reason for that, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=384.24s)]
*  There were people who were trying to cover up for their entirely inadequate and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=385.76000000000005s)]
*  honestly awful response. So in this instance, you just want to say, well, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  why can't we know the truth? If it's so straightforward, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=393.64s)]
*  if it's such an obvious story, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=396.4s)]
*  why are there two law enforcement agencies that have different facts? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  That's just a reality. They can say that it's QAnon or conspiracy or lunacy, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  but how about just the truth? But Will, we all know, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=406.0s)]
*  they didn't want that before the election and they're not going to want it on [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3r9SWuujM&t=408.64s)]
