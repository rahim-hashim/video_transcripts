# Kanye West: Media's promotion of obesity is demonic
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM)
*  There's a group mob. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's like liberal Nazis that will go up and attack you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=2.04s)]
*  Like I said, you know, everyone's like, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=8.72s)]
*  Anna Wintour's your friend. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, this Gabby girl and Gigi and these people, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=12.8s)]
*  they would have never said anything negative [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=21.0s)]
*  unless they got the OK from Cond√© Nast, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=23.2s)]
*  unless they got the OK from Anna. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=25.92s)]
*  They would have never got the OK to comment. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=29.16s)]
*  Like let's just talk about specifically. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  So these are people who are attacking you for your t-shirt. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=34.08s)]
*  Well, it was a setup. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=36.68s)]
*  It started off as, it started off as them having this black girl [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=38.56s)]
*  comment and say, well, I felt traumatized [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=49.8s)]
*  when I saw this t-shirt. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=53.96s)]
*  A black girl saying, I felt traumatized [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=57.12s)]
*  when I saw a black man wearing something [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=59.68s)]
*  that he wasn't allowed to wear. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=66.2s)]
*  It's like in Django when Jamie Foxx is on top of a horse [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=67.6s)]
*  and Samuel Jackson is like, you know, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=71.92s)]
*  that black guy's not supposed to be on top of the horse. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=74.56s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=77.28s)]
*  And then I went and said, hey, I don't like your boots. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=78.0s)]
*  I know Anna Wintour doesn't like your boots [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=82.56s)]
*  and you're not a fashion person. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=84.48s)]
*  And then people started to say, I was a bully. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=86.56s)]
*  But it was a setup. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=90.92s)]
*  And they finally got it, right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=92.68s)]
*  Because I eliminated the BLM officer at Adidas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=94.08s)]
*  And then I got out of the Gap deal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  And just one by one by one, I just be, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=104.56s)]
*  I've been winning these battles, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  And they thought they had me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=109.44s)]
*  They had the idea that Ye was bullying [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=111.04s)]
*  what I think the term, the liberal term, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=116.16s)]
*  is a body goes black woman. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=117.64s)]
*  Now let's talk about Gabby and my good friend Lizzo. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=122.52s)]
*  Lizzo works with my trainer, a friend of mine, Harley [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  Pasnack, Harley Pasnack. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=128.68s)]
*  When Lizzo loses 10 pounds and announces it, the bots, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=131.44s)]
*  that's a term for people like, it's like telemarketer callers, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=138.04s)]
*  like on Instagram, they attack her for losing weight. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=143.04s)]
*  Because the media wants to put out a perception [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=147.4s)]
*  that being overweight is the new goal when [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=151.28s)]
*  it's actually unhealthy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=155.0s)]
*  Let's get aside the fact of whether it's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  fashion and vogue, which it's not. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=159.68s)]
*  Or if someone thinks it's attractive to each his own, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=163.76s)]
*  it's actually clinically unhealthy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=167.64s)]
*  And for people to promote that, it's demonic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=172.2s)]
*  You know? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=181.76s)]
*  Can I ask you? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=182.56s)]
*  I've noticed this also. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=183.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=184.48s)]
*  Why do you think they would want to promote [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  unhealthiness among the population? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=187.4s)]
*  It's a genocide of the black race. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  They want to kill us in any way they can. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=191.72s)]
*  Planned Parenthood was made by Margaret Sanger, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=195.0s)]
*  a known eugenics with the KKK. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=198.8s)]
*  And I believe that if we saw ourselves as more, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=201.88s)]
*  if we saw ourselves as a people and not a race, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=207.12s)]
*  then we would treat our people better. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=210.48s)]
*  Like if you go to a Jewish person and you say a race, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  it almost gets confusing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=215.48s)]
*  It'll cut you off quickly and say, we're not a race. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  We're a people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, are people supposed to just say, say it loud. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=222.56s)]
*  I'm black and I'm proud. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=226.04s)]
*  OK, well, what about, do you own the land [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=227.44s)]
*  that you're living in? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=231.24s)]
*  Do you own, is the contracts even [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=233.36s)]
*  in a language that's even possibly understandable? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=239.28s)]
*  You know, for your heritage? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=239.8s)]
*  You know? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=242.52s)]
*  And in America, we as blacks will, like, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  down each other on how good we speak. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=248.4s)]
*  But we're speaking English. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=252.56s)]
*  There's nothing whiter than English. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=254.8s)]
*  We're not in our native tongue, actually. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=256.68s)]
*  So we judge each other on white goal lines, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=259.8s)]
*  not based on exactly what our culture is based on. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bj0FQjRYjM&t=266.6s)]
