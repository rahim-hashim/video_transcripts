# Mark Serbu: The 'Butt Master' is causing 'quite a stink' in Canada
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg)
*  Justin Trudeau has decided, like all dictators do, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=0.0s)]
*  if you want a police state, you cannot let people [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  defend themselves with firearms. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=5.16s)]
*  So Canada has just banned virtually all firearms [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=6.36s)]
*  in the country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=9.92s)]
*  That include handguns and hunting rifles. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=10.92s)]
*  Now Justin Trudeau doesn't know what side of the gun [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=13.44s)]
*  the bullet comes out of. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=15.84s)]
*  He has no idea really what a gun is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=16.92s)]
*  He knows his bodyguards have a lot of them, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=19.0s)]
*  but that's really it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=20.36s)]
*  But he's against guns. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=21.96s)]
*  So against him that Trudeau's government [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=23.28s)]
*  has just banned a gun called the Buttmaster. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=25.44s)]
*  Now you may recall the name, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=29.28s)]
*  since so many mass shootings have been committed [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  with the Buttmaster. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=32.36s)]
*  Well actually no, there really isn't a Buttmaster. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=34.72s)]
*  In fact, we think there's only one Buttmaster in history. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  It was invented as a gag by a gun designer [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=39.84s)]
*  in Tampa, Florida, 23 years ago. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Actually a fairly famous gun designer called Mark Sirbu, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=45.56s)]
*  who joins us right now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=49.36s)]
*  So first of all, Mark, thank you for coming on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=51.8s)]
*  Congratulations on having the Buttmaster banned [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=53.92s)]
*  by an entire country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=57.04s)]
*  But just tell us, the Buttmaster was not designed [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=58.68s)]
*  for mass shootings, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=62.8s)]
*  No, I had no idea about mass shootings. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=65.84s)]
*  Yeah, they weren't as popular back then. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=68.28s)]
*  But yeah, it's causing quite a stink [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=70.52s)]
*  in Canada right now, isn't it? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=73.24s)]
*  So the Buttmaster, as far as I understand, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=75.32s)]
*  and I've watched the video, I kinda want one, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=77.32s)]
*  but I don't think they're any for sale. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=78.72s)]
*  But the Buttmaster is a single shot 22 long rifle [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=79.68s)]
*  with like a spring loaded striker. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=84.52s)]
*  It's like the most primitive zip gun in history, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=86.64s)]
*  is that correct? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=89.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very simple and it's kinda nicer [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=90.56s)]
*  than the average pen gun that's out there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=94.84s)]
*  But yeah, it's just one shot and as you saw, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=97.16s)]
*  you've gotta unscrew it and screw it back together. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=100.12s)]
*  Can't talk, screw it back together [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=102.76s)]
*  and I've actually got one right here, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  or the only one right here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=105.28s)]
*  The only one? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=107.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=109.4s)]
*  So it's not even for sale. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  They're being the only one. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=111.08s)]
*  Yeah, the only one I've had in my possession for 23 years [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=112.28s)]
*  and somehow it made it on the ban list, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=115.64s)]
*  which is absurd as you know, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=117.8s)]
*  which is why we're talking about it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=120.12s)]
*  So if they're even banning the Buttmaster, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=121.76s)]
*  the world's only Buttmaster that really should be [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=125.4s)]
*  in the Smithsonian and I hope it will someday be, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=127.72s)]
*  how did they even know the Buttmaster exists? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=131.04s)]
*  Who's doing their firearms research, do you think? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=132.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's the weird thing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=135.24s)]
*  When I first got, somebody in Canada sent me an email [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=136.96s)]
*  and they're like, oh Mark Zerbo, you're a god, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=139.16s)]
*  this is amazing, this like master level trolling. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=141.12s)]
*  And of course I wasn't trolling from 23 years ago, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=143.72s)]
*  but yeah, at first I thought, man, this is hilarious, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=145.96s)]
*  it's awesome, but then you look on official [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=148.08s)]
*  Canadian documentation and you see Buttmaster [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=150.24s)]
*  and it's like, how could they be so inept to do that? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=152.96s)]
*  It's like, what staffer? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=157.32s)]
*  And it's almost like a game of Clue, you know? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=159.12s)]
*  It's like the idiot staffer with the laptop in the cubicle, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  you know, that's who did it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's just part of it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=167.16s)]
*  The story has so many dimensions to it, you know? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  Because obviously Trudeau's been saying, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  oh, we're getting rid of weapons of mass death [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=172.48s)]
*  and destruction, it's like, well, here's something [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=174.6s)]
*  with one shot, where you get run into a room [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=176.6s)]
*  and pull it out of your prison wallet [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=178.76s)]
*  and bang away with one shot while everybody beats you [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=181.16s)]
*  to death. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=183.64s)]
*  I mean, I guess the good news is he's a fascist, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=185.96s)]
*  but he's also a buffoon, and that's the self-limiting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=188.44s)]
*  fact about him. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=190.84s)]
*  Well that helps. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=191.88s)]
*  I appreciate your comment. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=193.16s)]
*  If you ever make the Buttmaster, set us up a couple [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=194.28s)]
*  aside from you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=196.52s)]
*  Oh yeah, we're probably gonna do a run, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=197.36s)]
*  so yeah, we'll let you know. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=198.92s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=200.28s)]
*  Call me. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=201.12s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=201.96s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=203.04s)]
*  Take care. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaVDr_SHtPg&t=203.88s)]
