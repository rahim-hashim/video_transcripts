# UFC President Dana White talks to Tucker Carlson
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ)
*  So, during the COVID pandemic, you may remember the government tried to shut down virtually [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  every business in the country, except the ones that pay them big campaign donations, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=5.68s)]
*  Planned Parenthood, liquor stores, Amazon and Google. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=10.92s)]
*  One of the organizations they tried very hard to shut down was the UFC, the fastest growing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=13.88s)]
*  sport in the United States. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=18.12s)]
*  We just sat down with the man who runs the UFC, Dana White. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=19.98s)]
*  He's the president in Las Vegas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=23.32s)]
*  And he told us why he held fights, why he kept his business going and his sport operating [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=25.76s)]
*  despite the COVID shutdowns. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Media does nothing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  They never built anything. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=36.04s)]
*  Nobody depends on them for a paycheck. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=39.0s)]
*  But all they do is sit back and criticize. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to kill people. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=45.42s)]
*  I care more about money than I do human life. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=46.88s)]
*  I heard it all. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=49.6s)]
*  And the New York Times, as you can imagine, was blasting me daily. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=51.28s)]
*  Petalong and fascinating interview with Dana White. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=57.2s)]
*  If you don't know who Dana White is, probably the most influential, certainly the most influential [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=59.64s)]
*  man in sports and a smart man. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  We're going to air the whole thing Monday right here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=65.16s)]
*  Also working on a documentary on him and the UFC for Tucker Carlson Originals coming out [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=67.0s)]
*  this winter. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=70.84s)]
*  But again, it's worth watching Monday, 8 Eastern. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=71.84s)]
*  are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=81.28s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7d-3v5jdRQ&t=83.88s)]
