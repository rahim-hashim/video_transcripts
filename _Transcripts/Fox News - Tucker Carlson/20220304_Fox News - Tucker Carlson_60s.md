# Tucker: How we know Kamala Harris is not a serious person #shorts
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y)
*  We knew that once Kamala Harris was involved, it couldn't really be that serious. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=0.0s)]
*  And we knew that because this is what she's like. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=4.0s)]
*  It is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=7.0s)]
*  Every day is time for us to agree. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=14.0s)]
*  This whole thing about the border, we've been to the border. We've been to the border. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=17.0s)]
*  You haven't been to the border. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=21.0s)]
*  And I haven't been to Europe. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=23.0s)]
*  And I don't think you guys, and my pronouns are she, her, and hers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=25.0s)]
*  She, her, and hers? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=29.0s)]
*  She would look down at me and Kamala, what do you want? What do you want? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=31.0s)]
*  And I look back up at her and I said, freedom! [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=34.0s)]
*  You're going to literally see the craters on the moon with your own eyes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=39.0s)]
*  With your own eyes, I'm telling you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=44.0s)]
*  We must together, work together, to see where we are, where we are headed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=47.0s)]
*  But also see it as a moment, yes, to together. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIXbeET41Y&t=54.0s)]
