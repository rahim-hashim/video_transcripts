# Victor Davis Hanson to SCOTUS harassers: 'Stop it'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M)
*  We are very grateful to be joined now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=0.0s)]
*  by a man who can sort this out, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=3.12s)]
*  Victor Davis Hanson, who's a fellow [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=4.68s)]
*  with the Hoover Institution. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  He joins us live. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=9.64s)]
*  So calling on people to harass Supreme Court justices, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=11.44s)]
*  where does this go, do you think? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=16.12s)]
*  Well, we know where it goes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=19.52s)]
*  It goes to Nicholas Roski showing up [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=20.48s)]
*  at the home of Brett Kavanaugh, wanting to kill him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=23.28s)]
*  We have the most sustained attack [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=26.34s)]
*  on the Supreme Court since the court packing [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=28.84s)]
*  of FDR 85 years ago. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=31.12s)]
*  I mean, the President of the United States [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=33.18s)]
*  went to a foreign country and attacked the Supreme Court [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=34.36s)]
*  in front of a Spanish host. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=37.2s)]
*  Law professor Elizabeth Warren said it was illegitimate. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=39.08s)]
*  Somebody committed a felony [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=42.92s)]
*  and leaked a confidential memo from the court. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=44.2s)]
*  It's a felony to go out in front of a justice's home. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=47.0s)]
*  We had the Senate minority leader just two years ago, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=50.36s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, say that the court, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=52.92s)]
*  and he named the justices by name, Tucker, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=54.68000000000001s)]
*  Justice Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=56.96s)]
*  And he said, you don't know what will hit you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=58.88s)]
*  And he said that they had reaped, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=60.12s)]
*  they had sowed the wind and they reaped the whirlwind. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=61.72s)]
*  What did he mean by that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=63.62s)]
*  They're going to reap the whirlwind [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=64.68s)]
*  on what was gonna hit them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=66.04s)]
*  And now we have this court packing scheme that arises. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=67.64s)]
*  It's part of a larger landscape, Tucker, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=70.56s)]
*  that the left is a revolutionary, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=72.56s)]
*  it's like the French Revolutionary Jacobin Movement. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=74.76s)]
*  They don't trust any customs, they don't honor any laws. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=77.0s)]
*  Everything is fluid and it's legal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=79.92s)]
*  only to the extent that it's useful. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=82.36s)]
*  So the 180-year filibuster [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=84.2s)]
*  that they used to treasure as a minority party [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=87.5s)]
*  in the Senate, they want to get rid of it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=89.66s)]
*  The 150-year nine-person Supreme Court, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=92.42s)]
*  get rid of it, it's no longer useful. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=96.62s)]
*  They can't have a Republican justice flip [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=98.2s)]
*  as they did from Warren to David Souter easily anymore. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=101.06s)]
*  So like adolescents, they're angry. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=104.1s)]
*  50 state union we've had for 60 years, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=106.3s)]
*  bring in two more states to get senators. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=108.98s)]
*  Same thing with a national voting law [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=110.94s)]
*  to override the constitutional prerogative [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=113.02s)]
*  of each state to set balloting laws. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=115.72s)]
*  And then we have the 232-year-old electoral college [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=118.12s)]
*  once the blue wall fell, like little kids, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=122.8s)]
*  they got angry and said, get rid of it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=124.9s)]
*  So the common denominator is all of this is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=127.28s)]
*  they look at the law as what's useful for the moment [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=130.42s)]
*  for a progressive agenda. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=133.24s)]
*  And when that is no longer true, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=134.7s)]
*  then they try to destroy the institution [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=136.64s)]
*  and that's what they're doing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=139.24s)]
*  And it's incumbent upon everybody [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=140.64s)]
*  to call them out for what they are. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=142.4s)]
*  Yeah, and to stop it if you can. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=144.84s)]
*  The activist left is dangerous and people need to take [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=146.44s)]
*  steps to protect themselves and their families. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=150.96s)]
*  Victorious Hanson, as always, thank you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=152.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clIwgdKnj8M&t=155.8s)]
