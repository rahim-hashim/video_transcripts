# Russian policy officer reveals what's at risk for the US
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4)
*  So while the rest of us have been distracted by Omicron, the word that's going to be the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=0.0s)]
*  punchline of incredibly bitter jokes five years from now, Omicron, as that has been [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=6.78s)]
*  taking up all of our disk space, the country has inexorably been moving closer to what [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=14.02s)]
*  could be an incredibly destructive war with Russia. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=18.82s)]
*  Our media is encouraging that war on MSNBC. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=22.52s)]
*  The lunatics are demanding to know why Joe Biden isn't doing more to defend the territory [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=25.82s)]
*  and imperial integrity of Ukraine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=29.98s)]
*  We've got to be aggressive in our defense of our allies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=33.06s)]
*  And Ukraine, despite what you hear from Putin propagandists across the world, and yes, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=37.78s)]
*  even here in America, despite what you hear, we have to defend our democratic allies. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=45.06s)]
*  And it's time for the Biden White House to start speaking more clearly and more aggressively [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=53.44s)]
*  and telling us how they're going to stop this invasion from happening. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=59.74s)]
*  People that stupid should not have TV shows and they certainly shouldn't be weighing [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  in on adult topics like war and peace, but they are. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=68.02s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself, why is this happening? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=71.34s)]
*  Why are the Russians so upset? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=74.9s)]
*  Why are we moving towards some kind of conflict? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=76.26s)]
*  Well, there's one reason. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=77.98s)]
*  Over a number of different administrations, the United States government has pushed Ukraine [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  to join NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=83.78s)]
*  Imagine if Mexico fell under the direct military control of China. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=87.62s)]
*  We would see that as a threat, of course. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=92.66000000000001s)]
*  There'd be no reason for that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=94.14s)]
*  Well, that's how Russia views NATO control of Ukraine. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=96.18s)]
*  And why wouldn't they? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=99.14s)]
*  We don't get anything out of pushing Ukraine into NATO. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=100.14s)]
*  So why are we doing this? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=102.86s)]
*  Clint Ehrlich is a Russia policy researcher. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=104.94s)]
*  He understands this issue quite well, and we're happy to have him join us this evening. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=107.5s)]
*  Clint, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=110.42s)]
*  So is it too simplistic to say the core dispute here is over Ukraine joining NATO? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=112.48s)]
*  I would say that that's Russia's perspective. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=119.36s)]
*  But here we have people who are arguing that even if the Russians don't invade Ukraine, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=121.4s)]
*  that we need to invade and kick the Russians out of Crimea. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=126.72s)]
*  That was an op-ed from a senior Obama administration official this week. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=129.86s)]
*  And so I would say that it's even simpler than that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=134.28s)]
*  We're dealing with our warmongers, unserious people whose policy prescriptions could have [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=136.08s)]
*  deadly serious consequences. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=140.2s)]
*  Well, they're deeply unserious people, and they're also people with a long and publicly [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=141.92s)]
*  available track record of failure, of conflicts that have diminished the United States materially [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=145.28s)]
*  over the last 20 years. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=150.76s)]
*  So why do they get a say in this? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=152.0s)]
*  They're failures. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=153.92s)]
*  They like to portray themselves as Cold Warriors, but the architect of America's strategy during [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=154.92s)]
*  the Cold War, George Kennan, warned that NATO expansion could lead us towards war with Russia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=159.72s)]
*  And he's been vindicated. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=164.88s)]
*  We're now on the precipice of that kind of conflict. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=165.88s)]
*  And so it's a great question. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Why is it that we should listen to these people? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=169.92s)]
*  Well, I couldn't agree more. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=171.8s)]
*  I mean, if Max Boot is still making your foreign policy, it's kind of your fault, I would say. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=172.8s)]
*  But and this is a sincere question. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=176.96s)]
*  Is there something I'm missing? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=179.06s)]
*  Is there some compelling American interest that would be served by having Ukraine and NATO? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=180.06s)]
*  No, the deeper irony is that NATO doesn't even want Ukraine, that it's a corrupt country. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=185.56s)]
*  It's more of a liability than it would be a military asset. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=191.96s)]
*  And the people who are pushing this simply argue that it needs to happen because Russia [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=194.88s)]
*  shouldn't have a veto over who's in NATO. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=198.28s)]
*  In other words, even when it's in our mutual interest to not have a state in NATO, we have [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=200.44s)]
*  to insist that they'll be added just to spite the Russians. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=204.8s)]
*  Look, I want to take people seriously, all people, even people I disagree with, maybe [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=207.84s)]
*  especially people I disagree with. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=211.4s)]
*  But this seems nuts. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=212.84s)]
*  Is that your assessment? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=214.28s)]
*  Tucker, it's not just nuts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=215.28s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we're sleepwalking towards conflict with a country that has more than 4000 nuclear [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  weapons. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=222.68s)]
*  The Russians are talking about potentially deploying strategic forces to Cuba and Venezuela [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=223.68s)]
*  in a repeat of the Cuban Missile Crisis. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  And so it's just shocking that people are not more upset about this because the lives [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=229.96s)]
*  of Americans are being threatened over a situation where we have no vital strategic national [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=234.44s)]
*  interest. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  So since 1945, we've really only fought wars against poor, disorganized third world countries, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  North Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=244.72s)]
*  Do you think that that's convinced a lot of our policymakers that it's like easy to fight [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  wars? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=251.56s)]
*  I think that it's convinced them of that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=252.56s)]
*  And also we haven't had war inside our country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=254.16s)]
*  The Russians have. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=256.56s)]
*  I understand the reality of war and what it's like to lose millions of people in a conflict. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=257.56s)]
*  And somehow our policymakers just imagine that war can never reach us. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=261.84s)]
*  And the reality is that you and I are in danger from this conflict, Tucker. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=266.12s)]
*  The people that we love are in danger. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=270.08s)]
*  And it's just incredibly disturbing that this is happening. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=272.6s)]
*  It really is. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=275.92s)]
*  Clint Ehrlich, I really appreciate your perspective tonight and your clarity. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=276.92s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrCy0Vlcy4&t=279.6s)]
