# Here's what the left really want: Shelby Steele
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo)
*  After Glenn Young's shocking win in Virginia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=0.0s)]
*  the left hasn't engaged in any reflection whatsoever. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=2.9s)]
*  Instead, they're accusing Virginia voters, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=5.86s)]
*  the people who just elected an African-American [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=7.94s)]
*  lieutenant governor, of being racists. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=10.18s)]
*  And when he pushes talking points that are meant to flirt [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=13.3s)]
*  with and stoke white backlash, he does so in a coded way [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=17.18s)]
*  with dog whistles about education. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=20.14s)]
*  The racial animus that is teeming [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=22.12s)]
*  with the dog whistle messaging. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  Racial language and dog whistles, quite frankly. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=29.04s)]
*  Some of it was dog whistle. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=33.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=35.22s)]
*  Some of it was dog whistle racism. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=35.72s)]
*  Horrible dog whistles from the GOP. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=39.16s)]
*  Dog whistling on education. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=42.82s)]
*  I think all the CRT stuff is trumped up dog whistling. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  What rose to sort of the national conversation [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  was the dog whistle. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=52.34s)]
*  Notice they keep referring to dog whistles, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  but they never even say what they're talking about. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=57.42s)]
*  Shelby Steeles, the writer of the documentary, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  What Killed Michael Brown? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  And he joins us with reaction. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=64.06s)]
*  All right, so Shelby, why won't they define and defend [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  exactly what CRT is? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=69.5s)]
*  Because they have no way to do it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=73.98s)]
*  And they know that it is in opposition [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=76.06s)]
*  to America's commitment to a racial harmony that's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=82.78s)]
*  gone on now for 60, 70 years. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=87.22s)]
*  The civil rights movement, the civil rights victories, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=90.3s)]
*  equality in the sense of as individuals. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=93.94s)]
*  All of that classic liberalism they see [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=97.78s)]
*  as infringing on their power. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=102.14s)]
*  If they can suspend that liberalism, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  then they have the power to dictate what goes on. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=109.7s)]
*  You saw Terry McAuliffe talking about one high school that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=113.3s)]
*  had 80% white teachers. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=117.38s)]
*  We needed to change that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=119.5s)]
*  We needed to go in, disregard their rights, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=120.86s)]
*  and cut that down to 50%. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=125.14s)]
*  Well, it's that kind of cold, inhuman calculation [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=128.74s)]
*  as a pretext for racial harmony that is extremely destructive. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=132.54s)]
*  And the reaction to it that we've seen [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=141.02s)]
*  in this current election is, by my light, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  it's a wonderful thing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=148.58s)]
*  It's a return to the classic view of racial harmony [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  based on our connection and appreciation of each other [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  as individuals rather than strictly members of a race, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  members of a nationality and ethnicity, and so forth. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=164.62s)]
*  These are all very divisive ways of thinking. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=169.86s)]
*  Such a brilliant point that you made, Martin Luther [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=174.22000000000003s)]
*  King, the civil rights movement. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=176.78s)]
*  That was all about a colorblind society. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=178.38000000000002s)]
*  That was about judging people not by the color of their skin, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  but by the content of their character. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=183.98000000000002s)]
*  And this is against everything that that was about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  This is about you're not born equal. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=191.22000000000003s)]
*  People are born racist. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  People are born oppressed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=194.62s)]
*  And as you said, that framework gives the left a pretext [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  to seize power and then re-engineer society, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=202.22s)]
*  move people up, pull people down, rework the entire system. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=205.54s)]
*  And it just takes away what is in our founding document, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  that all men are created equal. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=215.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=219.01999999999998s)]
*  That burdens them as far as they're concerned. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=220.5s)]
*  They truly are offended by that, by this idea [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  that we should be treated as individuals. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=228.82s)]
*  They have, over the last, since the 60s, gained enormous power. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=232.98s)]
*  The power of the American left really [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=240.86s)]
*  is grounded in race, in the idea of America [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=243.54s)]
*  as a victimizing, oppressive nation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=248.14s)]
*  And if they then cast themselves as our redeemers, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=251.5s)]
*  they're going to lift us out of this shame. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=255.5s)]
*  And as such, they need the power to socially engineer [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  without worrying about whether they're being civilized or not. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=263.3s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=267.58s)]
*  They're preying on white guilt. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=268.1s)]
*  And I think for the first time in a long time, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=269.3s)]
*  the race card backfired. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=271.94s)]
*  Didn't work. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=273.62s)]
*  Thank God for that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7slVibMYo&t=275.7s)]
