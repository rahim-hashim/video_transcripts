# Tucker: This is a deeply ominous sign
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A)
*  I want to begin with a Fox News alert tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=0.0s)]
*  There has been a hitch in the highly anticipated count in the Virginia governor's race. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=3.6s)]
*  Fairfax County, which is the biggest and most democratic county in the state of Virginia, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=8.64s)]
*  will not be supplying its vote results on time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=14.68s)]
*  We're supposed to have early vote shortly after seven o'clock Eastern, but an hour [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=17.6s)]
*  ago a Fairfax County official announced that there is a delay. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=21.0s)]
*  They say they need to rescan the ballots. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=24.04s)]
*  They're going to release a partial count, quote, of their early vote in person sometime [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=26.68s)]
*  this evening. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=30.96s)]
*  Bill Hemmer will be tracking that for us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=31.96s)]
*  We're also going to talk to Britt Hume. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=33.16s)]
*  Trying to figure out how many votes they need, apparently. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=34.68s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=37.28s)]
*  Good evening and welcome to Chuck Carlson tonight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=38.28s)]
*  Exactly one year from today is the congressional midterm elections. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=40.76s)]
*  Tonight, two governor's races in solidly democratic states on the Eastern Seaboard may give us [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=44.68s)]
*  a preview of what could be a tsunami to come. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=48.72s)]
*  In New Jersey, where polls have just closed, finance goon Phil Murphy, who appears to have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=51.78s)]
*  declared himself king of the long-suffering Goombah Republic, faces a surprisingly sharp [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=56.36s)]
*  challenge from a Republican called Jack Sidarelli. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=61.48s)]
*  It seems impossible that Murphy could actually lose in a state where entire cemeteries vote. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=64.62s)]
*  There are more than a million Democrats registered in New Jersey who are Republicans. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=69.7s)]
*  But despite those numbers, he may come close, and that would be a deeply ominous sign for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=73.36s)]
*  the party of Joe Biden. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=78.68s)]
*  We'll know the outcome of that race in just a few moments, and of course we'll bring it [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=79.68s)]
*  to you immediately. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=81.72s)]
*  And then to the Commonwealth of Virginia, previously mentioned. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=83.48s)]
*  That is the most consequential election of the year. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=86.28s)]
*  Terry McAuliffe was once the governor of the state. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  He ran and won eight years ago as a moderate, a pro-business Democrat, a dealmaker who didn't [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=91.34s)]
*  have time for ideology, and he won big. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=95.84s)]
*  And now he's back after four years. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  McAuliffe wants to run Virginia again, but this time he is a new man. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Like so many in his social class, Terry McAuliffe has gone woke. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=104.5s)]
*  He's an apostle for Bidenism, for equity, diversity, and the race-based politics of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=108.12s)]
*  A few weeks ago, McAuliffe announced that parents no longer have the authority over [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=113.88s)]
*  their own children. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=117.08s)]
*  Public schools in Virginia are going to force-feed your kids racist propaganda, and there is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=118.36s)]
*  nothing you can do about it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=122.1s)]
*  If you complain, you're a white supremacist. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=124.0s)]
*  McAuliffe said that repeatedly on television, and he meant it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  And then to underscore the point, Terry McAuliffe appeared at his final rally last night with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=129.96s)]
*  his only actual constituent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=134.76s)]
*  That would be the head of the country's most radical teachers union, Randy Weingarten, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  the person who bankrolls the Democratic Party. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=140.4s)]
*  Like Terry McAuliffe, Randy Weingarten isn't from Virginia. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=143.04s)]
*  Like Terry McAuliffe, she's never had children in public schools. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=145.78s)]
*  And so in that way, it was a perfect match. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  Here's part of what she said. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=151.44s)]
*  We know what happened when Terry McAuliffe was governor in this state. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=152.44s)]
*  We know how things turned around in terms of the economy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=159.44s)]
*  We know how things turned around in terms of people being seen and respected. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=167.2s)]
*  We know all of a sudden that people were heard. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=174.72s)]
*  Parents were heard. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  Teachers were heard. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  She is a lot of fun. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  Would you put her at the podium if she wasn't paying you? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  Nobody would. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  But did you listen to what she said? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  She said that until Terry McAuliffe was the governor eight years ago, certain people in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  Virginia were not, quote, seen and respected. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=194.72s)]
*  In other words, the state was a racist hellhole. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=197.48s)]
*  And then, thank heaven, Terry McAuliffe, Bill Clinton's sketchy, nearly indicted hatchet [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=200.68s)]
*  man from upstate New York, arrived and liberated the place. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  Terry McAuliffe is Virginia's Abe Lincoln. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=209.68s)]
*  That's what they're telling you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=211.92s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=213.76s)]
*  Here's Virginia's most famous political expert, a guy who works at a local college, explaining [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=215.2s)]
*  that only bigots oppose Abe Lincoln. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=219.32s)]
*  The operative word is not critical and it's not theory. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=222.44s)]
*  It's race. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=226.92s)]
*  What a shock, huh? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=227.92s)]
*  Race. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=229.88s)]
*  That is what matters. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=230.88s)]
*  And that's why it sticks. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=232.6s)]
*  There's a lot of, we can call it white backlash, white resistance, whatever you want to call [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=234.88s)]
*  it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  It has to do with race. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  White backlash, white resistance, white, white, white, white, white, meaning evil, cruel, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=244.52s)]
*  and bigoted. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=248.68s)]
*  That's the case all of them, including their little experts, are making for Terry McAuliffe. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=250.16s)]
*  They're telling you the other guy's a racist. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=253.96s)]
*  Now they're saying that because during election season that usually works for Democrats. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=256.12s)]
*  But what's interesting is that in this case it is not working. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=259.84s)]
*  Glenn Youngkin is the Republican candidate in this race. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=263.0s)]
*  He is not a racist. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  He is a Christian. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  He is a decent, uncommonly gentle man. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=267.4s)]
*  Too gentle for politics, in fact, many assumed. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=269.6s)]
*  And yet over the past few weeks, Glenn Youngkin has made a powerful and moving case for the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=272.56s)]
*  America that most people still want. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=277.26s)]
*  A colorblind meritocracy where all of us are judged for who we are as people, as individuals [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=279.86s)]
*  under God, and not for how we look as a member of some group. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  That vision could get Glenn Youngkin elected governor. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=291.5s)]
*  We expect it to find out tonight and now these hiccups with the count in Fairfax County. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=293.86s)]
*  There's a lot to assess tonight. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuZCaWYc6A&t=298.58s)]
