# Hunter Biden could end up with no jail time: Jesse Watters
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE)
*  According to the Media Research Center, good friends of ours, it has been, ready, 259 days [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=0.0s)]
*  since the network newscasts of record have uttered the words Hunter Biden. 259 days. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Thankfully, the Wall Street Journal is on the case, publishing a new article today titled [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=12.96s)]
*  Prosecutors' Advanced Tax Probe of Hunter Biden. It claims that the Hunter Biden probe is gaining [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=18.32s)]
*  steam when it comes to his taxes. Quote, prosecutors have asked questions about several [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=24.08s)]
*  companies associated with Hunter Biden and are examining whether he moved funds in a way to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=30.08s)]
*  obscure his tax liability. We've got new details regarding kickbacks Hunter allegedly received, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=36.4s)]
*  like the time a company led by a Kazakhstanie banker, remember Kazakhstan, wired 142 grand to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=44.08s)]
*  Hunter's consulting firm. That money was later used to buy Hunter an electric sports car, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=52.4s)]
*  a Fisker, and Hunter later traded it for a silver Porsche because nobody in the Biden family drives [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=58.56s)]
*  electric. Of course, that's just for you to do. Sounds sketchy to me, but something feels weird [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=65.36s)]
*  about this whole probe, right? Do you guys get the feeling that this whole tax investigation is just [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=71.52s)]
*  a red herring or a diversion away from more serious crimes? You know, charges that could [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=77.28s)]
*  implicate other members of the family, like the big guy. Jim Trusty is a former DOJ prosecutor, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=84.16s)]
*  and he joins us tonight. All right, Jim, what gives you the impression that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=92.8s)]
*  there's a little bit of a cleanup job going on at Biden's Department of Justice? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=96.4s)]
*  Well, you know, the starting point is that it was the defense attorneys for Hunter several [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=102.88s)]
*  months ago that leaked out this notion that he had some tax issues that he had to clean up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=106.72s)]
*  And I thought even at the time, that sounds like a really good defense attorney euphemism [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=111.6s)]
*  for much bigger problems. I mean, it's kind of like Al Capone's lawyers say, well, he's got a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=116.4s)]
*  little tax issue. Don't worry about the Valentine's Day massacre. So I think from the get-go, all the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=119.68s)]
*  public reporting we've seen about the laptop, about wire transfers from Russian oligarchs, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=124.64s)]
*  Kazakhstan, everywhere else, it all smells like a much bigger case than tax evasion. It smells like [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=130.4s)]
*  possibly Foreign Agent Registration Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, money laundering. I mean, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=136.4s)]
*  big weighty federal charges that are really indicative of a pay for play kind of scheme. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=141.36s)]
*  And so maybe the evidence isn't there, but if the evidence is there and you have these trial [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  balloons about tax cases coming out, it smells like something where there's going to be a little [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=151.6s)]
*  bit of DOJ collusion to come to a very soft ending in this case. Would Hunter have to go to prison [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=156.08s)]
*  for a tax beef? Well, not necessarily. I mean, there's room for prosecutors to be a little [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=161.84s)]
*  creative. It's harder when you're a federal prosecutor than a state prosecutor, believe it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  or not, because of things like mandatory sentences and sentencing guidelines that are driven by loss [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=173.12s)]
*  amount. In other words, all those dollars stack up to higher exposure for him, but there's ways to do [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=177.84s)]
*  it. And that's what I'm a little nervous about. Again, I don't have proof of this at all, but the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=183.12s)]
*  way it's been dragging on, the way it's been very quiet, the way the trial balloon came out, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=187.28s)]
*  I could see kind of a quiet Friday afternoon announcement that Hunter has a misdemeanor plea [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=191.44s)]
*  that he's got to enter or a deferred prosecution agreement. There are ways to either cap it or [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=196.56s)]
*  eliminate the ability of any judge to put prison on the table. Wow. So Hunter, after all this, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=201.92s)]
*  could end up with no jail time. Do you think that federal prosecutors, I know this is coming out of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=207.84s)]
*  Delaware, are getting pressure from main justice? Yeah, no way to know. I guess the way I would [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=214.56s)]
*  phrase it, Jesse, is there may not be pressure, but I'm not in love with how the FBI has conducted [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=222.32s)]
*  itself under Chris Ray. I don't see a big difference between the politicization that they had with [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=228.56s)]
*  Comey and take into account doing federal search warrants for diaries. I mean, that's unheard of. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=233.6s)]
*  I'm a little nervous that the investigating agency here has a little political edge to it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=240.4s)]
*  when it comes to the leadership. The U.S. attorney has kept their position because of this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=244.88s)]
*  investigation, which is actually not unheard of. That's typical when there's a potential conflict [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=249.44s)]
*  of interest. But I think it's a real integrity test for the attorney general, because that's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=253.6s)]
*  the guy that's going to have to sign off on anything, whether it's a very strong indictment, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=258.32s)]
*  a non-prosecution agreement, a deferred prosecution agreement, a soft plea, giving him basically no [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=263.12s)]
*  jail. Any of those things are going to make their way up to the attorney general. And boy, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=269.04s)]
*  it's a huge integrity test, I think, unlike anything we've seen in presidential history. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=273.04s)]
*  Well, we've had a guest on last week who told us they thought that Hunter was going to go to prison [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=278.88s)]
*  for a while unless his dad pardoned him. And now you're saying that he might get away scot-free. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=283.6s)]
*  And I don't know what to think. I'm just wondering where that diamond is that that Chinese tycoon [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  gave him. We'll have to keep following where the leads take us. Thank you very much, trustee. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=294.64s)]
*  All right. See you, Jess. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjGQ285McE&t=300.8s)]
