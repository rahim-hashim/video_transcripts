# Tucker Carlson: Biden trusts Beijing more than he trusts you
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, they always accuse you [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=1.8s)]
*  of the very things they're doing themselves. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=3.86s)]
*  If there's one rule you can keep on your fridge, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=6.46s)]
*  write it down, put it in your wallet [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=8.94s)]
*  to evaluate the behavior of the people in charge, it's that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=10.3s)]
*  They blame you for their sins every single time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  The latest example arrived this week [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=18.02s)]
*  when we learned that Joe Biden, fresh from lecturing us [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=19.32s)]
*  about how Donald Trump was a criminal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=22.18s)]
*  because he had unauthorized possession of secret documents, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=23.96s)]
*  that very same Joe Biden himself [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=26.779999999999998s)]
*  had unauthorized possession of secret documents. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  But don't worry, it's not a big deal. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=32.14s)]
*  Unlike you and that despicably orange Donald Trump, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden is a good person. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden is so virtuous, he has transcended temporal law. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=39.12s)]
*  It's not a crime when he does it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=41.94s)]
*  So that's the frustratingly familiar headline [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  from this week's story, which you've probably seen by now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  But the details of the story are actually pretty interesting. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=49.16s)]
*  So a week before these last midterm elections, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=51.78s)]
*  Joe Biden's lawyers were for some reason [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=54.12s)]
*  rooting around in a locked closet [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=56.3s)]
*  in the Washington office of something called [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=58.739999999999995s)]
*  the Penn-Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  And while in that locked closet, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=65.1s)]
*  Biden's lawyers found a sheaf [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  of highly classified government documents. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=68.82s)]
*  So the first question here is, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  why were Joe Biden's lawyers doing this in the first place? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=73.36s)]
*  And we can't say for sure because they haven't told us, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=76.38s)]
*  but it is weird. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=78.08s)]
*  Lawyers don't typically search locked closets, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=79.66s)]
*  yours probably don't, but Biden's lawyers did. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=81.94s)]
*  And we'd guess they did because they understood [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=85.24s)]
*  that Republicans were about to win back the House, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  and with it, congressional subpoena power. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  So they were likely conducting a cleanup operation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=92.16s)]
*  preemptively trying to get ahead of a scandal [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=94.6s)]
*  they knew was coming. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=96.3s)]
*  And of course, they hid what they found in that closet [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=97.72s)]
*  until after the midterm elections, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=99.72s)]
*  because there's no reason to influence voters [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=101.32s)]
*  too much with information. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=102.84s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=105.58s)]
*  And then there's the question of the so-called [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  Penn-Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  What is that exactly? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=111.97999999999999s)]
*  The whole idea of an academic Biden Center is pretty funny. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=113.6s)]
*  Joe Biden is a moron. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=117.28s)]
*  He's always been a moron, even before the dementia. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=118.64s)]
*  For decades in Washington, ask anyone who lived there, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=121.6s)]
*  Biden was famous as the dumbest member of the Senate. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=124.28s)]
*  People made jokes about it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  So why would an Ivy League university name a think tank [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=128.4s)]
*  after a man who can't think, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=132.16s)]
*  and then pay him nearly a million dollars a year [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=134.16s)]
*  for not doing anything? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=136.18s)]
*  Good question. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=138.12s)]
*  We'll have more on that in just a minute. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=139.12s)]
*  But first, a word about classified documents. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=141.26s)]
*  Now, this is not a partisan point, not attacking anybody. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=143.28s)]
*  It's just the truth. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=145.56s)]
*  These people you see on television huffing and puffing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=147.32s)]
*  about vital state secrets, on both sides, by the way, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=149.24s)]
*  not just Democrats, everybody, vital state secrets. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=151.68s)]
*  They're either lying or they don't really understand [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=154.8s)]
*  how Washington works. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=156.68s)]
*  How many legitimate vital state secrets are there? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=158.76s)]
*  Well, actually, not very many at all. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=161.8s)]
*  In a democracy, the government has no right to hide [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=164.22s)]
*  what it's doing from the public, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=166.96s)]
*  except under extraordinary circumstances. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=169.2s)]
*  It's fine to classify the Normandy invasion until it happens. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=171.96s)]
*  It is not fine to spend 60 years hiding the fact [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=174.96s)]
*  that the CIA was involved in the murder of a president. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  Hiding your involvement in the Kennedy assassination [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=180.8s)]
*  is not a national security precaution. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=183.0s)]
*  It is criminal behavior. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=185.44s)]
*  And it's made possible by a classification regime [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=187.28s)]
*  that was designed not to protect this country, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=189.44s)]
*  but to protect and enrich our permanent political class, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=192.36s)]
*  which it very efficiently does. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  Oh, but our enemies! [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=197.36s)]
*  Screeched the morons on TV. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=199.4s)]
*  If we did classify these documents, whatever they are, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=201.3s)]
*  if we do that, our enemies will learn our secrets. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=203.94s)]
*  Please. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  China already knows our secrets, all of our secrets. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=208.18s)]
*  The Chinese government has hacked every agency in Washington, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=211.18s)]
*  and everybody knows that, and nobody seems to care. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=213.46s)]
*  The Biden administration cares so little, in fact, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=216.82000000000002s)]
*  it just suspended a counter-espionage program [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=218.58s)]
*  designed to stop Chinese spying. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=221.3s)]
*  In other words, the Chinese can know, but you can't know. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=223.74s)]
*  Biden trusts Beijing more than he trusts you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=227.02s)]
*  So the media's job, its only job, really, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=230.62s)]
*  is to push back against attitudes like that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  and to seek the truth. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=235.22s)]
*  Reporters are the people who are paid, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  who for a living find out what your government is doing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=238.9s)]
*  and then tell you about it so democracy can continue. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  But there are very few of those left. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=245.66s)]
*  Julian Assange is in prison for his efforts. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=247.74s)]
*  Ed Snowden lives in exile. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=250.1s)]
*  And the news organizations that remain [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  are so thoroughly controlled by government agencies [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=254.18s)]
*  that even the suggestion of more public transparency [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=257.06s)]
*  drives them to hysteria. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=259.74s)]
*  Watch CNN and MSNBC, for example, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=261.86s)]
*  react to the news that Republicans in Congress [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=264.42s)]
*  might tell us some of what the thoroughly corrupt [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=266.58s)]
*  intel community has been doing in our name. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=269.18s)]
*  A House committee where Republicans can shred [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=272.42s)]
*  at the integrity of the federal government [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=275.06s)]
*  and tell America that your government is spying on you [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=277.1s)]
*  and coming after you, that is at the heart [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=280.74s)]
*  of this tear down, break down the government, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=283.42s)]
*  we can't trust the government, we're going to topple it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=285.54s)]
*  He just gave them a committee platform [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=288.1s)]
*  to have those hearings. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=290.26s)]
*  And you better believe that is going to be heroin [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=291.66s)]
*  in the veins of Fox News viewers over the next two years. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=294.3s)]
*  Basically, they're establishing a subcommittee [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=297.06s)]
*  or a committee on witch hunts [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=299.42s)]
*  and deep state conspiracy theories. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=301.62s)]
*  This is so extraordinarily dangerous. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=304.1s)]
*  As you said, they're going to actually, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=306.62s)]
*  these people want to target America's intel community. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=309.22s)]
*  This is a body of the Congress [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=314.34000000000003s)]

*  And we are not going to do that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=323.14000000000004s)]
*  by opening up all kinds of suspicions [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=325.5s)]
*  about the institutions in our society. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=328.42s)]
*  It's outrageous to tell people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  the government is spying on them, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=335.38000000000005s)]
*  especially since the government is spying on them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=337.38000000000005s)]
*  That's confirmed by the way. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=340.26000000000005s)]
*  That's a fact, they spied on us. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=341.58000000000004s)]
*  But if you want to know what your government is doing, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=344.1s)]
*  scolds Joe Scarborough, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=346.14000000000004s)]
*  you're quote, targeting America's intel community. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=347.62s)]
*  You're unpatriotic, you're a disloyal American [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=350.70000000000005s)]
*  if you don't want to be lied to. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=353.46000000000004s)]
*  That's what they're saying out loud on MSNBC tonight. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=356.06s)]
*  In the past few months, we've learned that for years, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=359.98s)]
*  Twitter functioned as a mouthpiece [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=362.02000000000004s)]
*  for the FBI and the spy agencies. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  Clearly the same thing has happened to cable news. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=367.1s)]
*  And that is a graver threat to our democracy [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=369.82000000000005s)]
*  than any group of Trump voters [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=372.82s)]
*  who wandered around the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=374.17999999999995s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=376.5s)]
*  But back to our story [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  and the hilariously obvious double standard [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=379.26s)]
*  on the question of classified documents. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=382.14s)]
*  It was just this summer [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=384.38s)]
*  that NBC's hyperventilating house historian, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=385.9s)]
*  Michael Beschloss, suggests that Donald Trump [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=388.53999999999996s)]
*  deserved the death penalty [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=390.85999999999996s)]
*  for keeping classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=392.46s)]
*  fried like the Rosenbergs in the electric chair. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=394.78s)]
*  Former CIA director, Michael Hayden agreed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=397.78s)]
*  Sounds about right, Hayden wrote. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  Because at this point, it's totally normal [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=401.94s)]
*  for CIA directors to fantasize [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=403.62s)]
*  about killing American presidents. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=406.06s)]
*  So just for fun today, we reached out to Michael Beschloss [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=408.74s)]
*  to ask what punishment he thinks Joe Biden deserves [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=411.14s)]
*  for keeping classified documents in his office. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=414.46s)]
*  Of course, Beschloss didn't respond to us. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=417.94s)]
*  He was too busy applying pancake makeup [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=419.58s)]
*  in his living room for another MSNBC hit. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=421.74s)]
*  But to be fair, it wasn't just Michael Beschloss [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=424.26s)]
*  who claimed that Trump was endangering America [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=426.14s)]
*  with those documents. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=427.98s)]
*  They all said that. Watch. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=429.46s)]
*  The seriousness of the potential threat [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  to national security information, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  I just don't know what to say. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  If he was in possession of classified documents, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=438.62s)]
*  those are, by definition, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=441.18s)]
*  potentially harmful to our national security. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=442.98s)]
*  We have a president of the United States [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=445.42s)]
*  who has played fast and loose with the national security. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  We have a situation where what he was doing [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=452.1s)]
*  was dangerous to our national security. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=454.54s)]
*  These are really classified [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=457.14s)]
*  and really a threat to national security. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=458.74s)]
*  That really jumps out to me as a national security threat. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=461.66s)]
*  This is a national security crisis. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=466.3s)]
*  The extreme risk that Trump was willing to take [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=468.38000000000005s)]
*  with our national security. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=471.46000000000004s)]
*  The funniest part was Bernstein, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=475.54s)]
*  formerly the Washington Post, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=477.90000000000003s)]
*  who literally participated in an FBI operation, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=478.94000000000005s)]
*  not guessing, documented an FBI operation [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=481.54s)]
*  to drive a sitting duly-elected president from office. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=484.42s)]
*  Carl Bernstein participated in that, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=487.34000000000003s)]
*  and he's lecturing us about how, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=489.26000000000005s)]
*  no, we have to keep the secret things secret. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=490.46000000000004s)]
*  So last night we learned that Joe Biden, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=493.94s)]
*  someone with no power to declassify anything [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  when he was vice president, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=498.02000000000004s)]
*  stashed classified documents [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  in the closet of his private office. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=501.14000000000004s)]
*  At the very same time, he was sending the DOJ, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=502.94s)]
*  after Donald Trump, for doing the same thing. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=505.06s)]
*  So how exactly are our news media [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=508.26s)]
*  going to make sense of this? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=510.82s)]
*  Well, of course, with maximum shamelessness. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=512.5s)]
*  Today, CNN trotted out a CIA lawyer called Brian Greer [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=515.22s)]
*  to explain that mishandling classified information [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=518.42s)]
*  is no longer a big deal. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=520.66s)]
*  In fact, honestly, kids, it happens all the time. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=521.54s)]
*  Almost any mishandling case could potentially be shoehorned [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=524.9399999999999s)]
*  into a criminal investigation. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=528.2199999999999s)]
*  But going back to my prior point, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=530.3399999999999s)]
*  because this type of mishandling happens all the time, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=531.66s)]
*  and now it's become such a political football [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=534.6999999999999s)]
*  with all three last presidential candidates [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=536.78s)]
*  being investigated, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=540.0999999999999s)]
*  I do worry about, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=541.18s)]
*  while we need to take this all seriously [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=543.2199999999999s)]
*  and it needs to be investigated, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=544.74s)]
*  I do worry about over-criminalizing it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=546.3s)]
*  Launching these full investigations [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=549.1s)]
*  that become political footballs is dangerous [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=550.66s)]
*  because it can disincentivize people [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=553.02s)]
*  from serving in the federal government. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=555.78s)]
*  But we do want to incentivize them [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=557.74s)]
*  to begin to do the right thing, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=559.02s)]
*  which is report it when it happens, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=559.86s)]
*  and not to do the wrong thing, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=561.54s)]
*  which is to conceal and obstruct, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=562.62s)]
*  which is what Trump did. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=564.42s)]
*  Some of us who've worked in cable news [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=567.1s)]
*  for the past 25 years can affirm [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=568.62s)]
*  it wasn't always the case [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=571.18s)]
*  that every time you flipped on the tube, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=572.3s)]
*  there was some CIA or NSA or FBI employee [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=574.02s)]
*  and the truth is, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=577.74s)]
*  because news organizations used to assume [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=578.82s)]
*  that if someone was paid to lie for the government, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=580.86s)]
*  they probably weren't a reliable oracle on TV. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=583.66s)]
*  They probably weren't telling the truth to viewers, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=587.0600000000001s)]
*  but now it's the norm. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=589.1s)]
*  So the CIA lawyer you just saw, Brian Greer, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=590.98s)]
*  was telling us just a few months ago [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=593.1s)]
*  that Donald Trump, by doing the same thing that Biden did, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=594.82s)]
*  endangered, quote, national security. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=597.1800000000001s)]
*  The intelligence agency's Greer said, quote, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=600.58s)]
*  have no choice but to assume a compromise [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=602.62s)]
*  and take proactive measures to protect our sources [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=605.38s)]
*  and collection capabilities. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=608.14s)]
*  That was then like August. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=611.74s)]
*  Now he's telling you this kind of thing happens all the time. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=614.3s)]
*  Just calm down, calm down. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=616.26s)]
*  The rest of the news media has been every bit as brazen. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=618.98s)]
*  The Washington Post just reported that, quote, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=621.46s)]
*  the case will likely draw comparisons to Mar-a-Lago, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=623.5s)]
*  but appears to be quite different. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=626.3s)]
*  Really, how is it quite different? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=627.9399999999999s)]
*  By the way, every news source is telling us [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=630.62s)]
*  there were 10 documents found. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=632.54s)]
*  How do they know that? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=633.82s)]
*  Well, of course they don't know that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=634.66s)]
*  They have no idea how many documents were found. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=635.74s)]
*  They're just taking Biden's lawyer's word for it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=637.8199999999999s)]
*  That's not news collection. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=640.78s)]
*  That's press release writing. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=642.6999999999999s)]
*  But you will see identical articles in Forbes [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=644.74s)]
*  and Business Insider and The Hill, the usual places, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=647.62s)]
*  all repeating the same scripted talking point. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=651.98s)]
*  Now in one sense, what those outlets are telling you is true. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=654.5799999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden, we learned today, was not holding on [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=657.8199999999999s)]
*  to the kind of cocktail napkins found at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=659.6999999999999s)]
*  He had actual classified information [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=662.26s)]
*  about a bunch of countries, including Ukraine, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=665.78s)]
*  from his time as vice president. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=669.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=670.9399999999999s)]
*  Why is it always about Ukraine? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=671.78s)]
*  What is going on in Ukraine? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=672.86s)]
*  Don't talk about the biolabs. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=674.74s)]
*  What is that? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=676.22s)]
*  Why the obsession with Ukraine going back long before [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=677.7s)]
*  the Russian invasion of Ukraine, going back many years? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=681.9s)]
*  Well, in this case, it turns out that three days [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=685.3s)]
*  before Joe Biden left his job as vice president [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=687.06s)]
*  in January of 2017, the Ukrainians were also [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=690.9s)]
*  a little bit confused about the focus on their country. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=693.86s)]
*  In mid-January 2017, state department officials [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=696.94s)]
*  circulated a report from Ukraine Forum, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=699.74s)]
*  that's the Ukraine state media organization. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=702.26s)]
*  And the report said this, and we're quoting, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=704.02s)]
*  literally on the last days of his term, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=705.78s)]
*  the US Vice President Joe Biden is going to Kiev. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=708.14s)]
*  How can we explain this attention to us? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=710.94s)]
*  So even the Ukrainians were confused. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=713.86s)]
*  Why is the president of the United States [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=716.1800000000001s)]
*  the world's richest country, spending so much of his life [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=719.14s)]
*  focused on Europe's poorest country, Ukraine? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=722.26s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=724.58s)]
*  Well, here's one explanation. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=726.46s)]
*  At the same moment that Joe Biden was visiting Ukraine [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=727.9s)]
*  as his last official act, his drug addicted son, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=732.3000000000001s)]
*  Hunter was still making tens of thousands of dollars [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=734.5400000000001s)]
*  a month in a no show job on the board of Barisma, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=736.46s)]
*  the largest gas company in Ukraine. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=739.5s)]
*  Natural gas, something Hunter Biden knew nothing about. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=741.78s)]
*  Hunter Biden wouldn't hold that fake job until 2019. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=745.1s)]
*  So is there a connection, just guessing here, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=748.18s)]
*  between the fact that his son was getting rich from Ukraine [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=750.38s)]
*  for a no show job and Joe Biden's 2017 trip to Ukraine [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=754.34s)]
*  on Air Force Two at your expense? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=757.74s)]
*  You think there might be a connection, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=760.5s)]
*  but so far no one in Washington has thought [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=761.62s)]
*  to really press that point, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=763.14s)]
*  because they're still upset about Trump. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=764.38s)]
*  They're still talking about Trump and his crimes. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=766.14s)]
*  Watch Joe Biden from this past September explain [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=769.8199999999999s)]
*  why he supported the DOJ raid on Mar-a-Lago. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=772.1s)]
*  And here's a hint, because it's quote, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=775.42s)]
*  totally irresponsible for government officials [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=777.3s)]
*  to keep classified documents after leaving office. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=779.5799999999999s)]
*  When you saw the photograph of the top secret documents [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=783.02s)]
*  laid out on the floor at Mar-a-Lago, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=787.66s)]
*  what did you think to yourself looking at that image? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=789.9399999999999s)]
*  How that could possibly happen, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=794.54s)]
*  how anyone could be that irresponsible. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  And I thought what data was in there [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=800.9399999999999s)]
*  that may compromise sources and methods. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  By that I mean names of people who helped, et cetera. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=805.7s)]
*  And it's just totally irresponsible. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=809.82s)]
*  So they seem like hypocrites. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=814.58s)]
*  We could play an endless loop of clips like that [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=816.3000000000001s)]
*  for the rest of the hour, you get the point, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=818.86s)]
*  but they're not actually hypocrites. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=820.5400000000001s)]
*  What they're describing is a caste system, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=821.7s)]
*  where they can do what they want, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=823.7800000000001s)]
*  and you are subject to the minutia of their legal code. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=825.1s)]
*  It's called anarcho-tyranny. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=829.1400000000001s)]
*  But on to more enduring questions, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=833.1s)]
*  because we know that already. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=834.7s)]
*  What is this Penn-Biden Center? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=836.1400000000001s)]
*  The Penn-Biden Center, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=838.5s)]
*  what's the purpose of the Penn-Biden Center? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=840.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, in April of 2016, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=842.6600000000001s)]
*  one of Hunter Biden's business associates [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=844.1800000000001s)]
*  explained the purpose in an email to Hunter. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=846.1s)]
*  He said that the Penn-Biden Center, quote, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=848.62s)]
*  operates like the Clinton Global Initiative [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  without the money raise. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=852.86s)]
*  Oh, so all the upside, none of the downside. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=854.86s)]
*  Without the money raise, really? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=859.2600000000001s)]
*  So you don't have to fly around the world raising money. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=860.9s)]
*  But as the Washington Free Beacon has reported, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=863.06s)]
*  actually there was a lot of money being raised, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=865.38s)]
*  and it was being raised by the University of Pennsylvania, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=867.3s)]
*  and it was being raised from foreign governments [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=869.74s)]
*  after the Biden Center opened. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  See the connection here? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=873.62s)]
*  And we're quoting from the piece. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=874.78s)]
*  Foreign contributions to the University of Pennsylvania [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=876.3s)]
*  tripled since the Penn-Biden Center's soft opening [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=878.7s)]
*  in March of 2017, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=881.54s)]
*  rising from 31 million in 2016 to over 100 million in 2019. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=883.18s)]
*  Now, where'd all that money come from? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=888.8199999999999s)]
*  Where do you think? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=891.38s)]
*  The largest foreign contributor was China. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=892.58s)]
*  And if you go to the webpage for the Penn-Biden Center, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=895.9399999999999s)]
*  you get some idea of what that money bought. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=898.86s)]
*  So on the site, there's a section called, quote, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=901.9399999999999s)]
*  addressing threats to the liberal international order. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=904.34s)]
*  Russia and Vladimir Putin are mentioned as threats [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=907.22s)]
*  to the liberal international order, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=909.38s)]
*  but China, which is currently committing genocide, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=911.58s)]
*  is conspicuously not mentioned [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=914.74s)]
*  as a threat to the liberal international order. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=916.4200000000001s)]
*  So all of this aroused our suspicions naturally, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=919.98s)]
*  so we decided to get a closer look [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=922.0600000000001s)]
*  at the University of Pennsylvania and its ties to China. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=923.3000000000001s)]
*  We took a look at text messages from Hunter Biden's laptop [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=927.46s)]
*  to see if we could find an answer. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=930.2600000000001s)]
*  And we found messages between a senior professor [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=932.02s)]
*  at Penn's International Relations Department [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=934.34s)]
*  to Naomi Biden, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=936.3000000000001s)]
*  that would be Hunter Biden's very young daughter. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=937.4200000000001s)]
*  The message from the professor begins this way, quote, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=940.38s)]
*  Pretty remarkable. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=961.98s)]
*  As far as we know, that has not been previously reported. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=964.74s)]
*  So here you have an employee of the University of Pennsylvania, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=967.1s)]
*  an Ivy League school, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=969.7s)]
*  sending an invitation apparently on behalf of the university [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=971.34s)]
*  of Pennsylvania that says that Trump's [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=974.82s)]
*  Ivy League school, sending an invitation, apparently on behalf of the Chinese Communist [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=988.22s)]
*  Party, to recruit Joe Biden's granddaughter for an influence operation, saying that she [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=993.02s)]
*  would be flown to Beijing and stay in Chinese government-controlled accommodations. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=998.58s)]
*  So a lot of people on television seem very concerned about national security at the moment. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=1004.1s)]
*  All these former CIA and NSA and FBI employees are going on CNN and MSNBC to tell you national [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=1008.6800000000001s)]
*  security implications are first in mind. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=1014.0s)]
*  Are they concerned about this? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=1017.32s)]
*  Will they ask a single question about it? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=1018.88s)]
*  Of course they won't. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=1021.74s)]
*  So tonight we're going to begin by asking fact-based questions about those classified [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=1023.32s)]
*  materials that Joe Biden apparently had at the Penn-Biden Center and what they tell us. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJftHe7byo&t=1026.74s)]
