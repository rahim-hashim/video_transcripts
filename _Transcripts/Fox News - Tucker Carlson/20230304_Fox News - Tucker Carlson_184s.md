# Ethnobotanist warns Tucker about the dangers of red tide in the Gulf
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A)
*  So we talk a lot about climate, but how's the actual environment doing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=0.0s)]
*  The soil and the air and the water. Well, whales and dolphins were washing them dead in the northeast, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=4.32s)]
*  apparently because of wind farm construction. And now there is unfolding what may be the biggest [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=8.64s)]
*  environmental disaster of all. It's called red tide. It's covering 100 square miles tonight in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  the Gulf of Mexico. So red tide occurs when colonies of algae grow out of control. Toxins in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=19.52s)]
*  red tide kill fish in huge numbers. Red tide also makes it hard for people to breathe. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=24.72s)]
*  But it's also true that red tide may cause ALS, Lou Gehrig's. So this is a huge problem that is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=31.52s)]
*  widely ignored for some reason. Paul Alan Cox is an ethnobotanist. He's the documentarian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=38.0s)]
*  who did Toxic Puzzle and we're happy to have him join us tonight. Thank you so much [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  for coming on. So you did this amazing documentary, terrifying documentary, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=47.76s)]
*  on red tide. And yet I think most people aren't aware of what a threat it is. Tell us if you would [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=52.0s)]
*  what red tide does to people potentially. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Carlson. There's been red tides [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=59.36s)]
*  along the west coast of Florida for, oh gosh, a century and a half. They're not unusual. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=65.92s)]
*  And they produce various neurotoxins that people detect by getting stinging in the eyes and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=71.36s)]
*  sometimes respiratory distress. Sometimes they poison shellfish. We've looked at other types of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=77.28s)]
*  harmful algal blooms called cyanobacteria and found they have a toxin that not only causes [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=83.28s)]
*  cancer but also can cause ALS. And that's something that we're monitoring very closely [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=90.88s)]
*  with the outflows from Lake Okeechobee in Florida. I mean, I don't think, I think there's a consensus [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=97.2s)]
*  that ALS has got to be the scariest or certainly one of the scariest diseases that people get. So [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=102.72s)]
*  anything that might cause it, it seemed would set off like alarm bells and people would be [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=107.6s)]
*  completely freaked out about it. I don't get the sense that the response to this is very urgent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=112.96s)]
*  Well, fortunately, ALS is a very rare disease, but we found that a toxin called BMAA increases [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=119.2s)]
*  your risk of getting ALS. Our colleagues, Dr. Elijah Stommel at Dartmouth University Neurology [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=125.84s)]
*  Department, our colleagues in Florida have found that if you're near these cyanobacteria blooms, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=132.4s)]
*  that your risk goes up. So this is completely avoidable. People should just stay away from [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  these cyanobacteria tides. If they have asthma or serious neurological conditions, just stay indoors [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=143.44s)]
*  and stay away till it's clear. And I think there's a real strong consensus of scientists that this is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=150.0s)]
*  a problem we can actually solve just by cleaning up the water a little bit. I think it'll really go [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  a long ways. Cleaning up the water. It's just nice to hear somebody say that out loud because [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=160.48s)]
*  you rarely do at this point for some reason. We appreciate your coming on. Dr. Paul Allen-Cox, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=165.76s)]
*  thank you. Thank you very much. Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=170.32s)]
*  opens. Stories that are changing the world and changing your life. From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctLARsFs-A&t=177.76s)]
