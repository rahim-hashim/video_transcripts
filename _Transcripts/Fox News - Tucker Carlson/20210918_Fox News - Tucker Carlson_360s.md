# Rose McGowan exposes how powerful people tried to silence her
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo)
*  During the public fight with Weinstein, I was exhausted and I was broke. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=0.0s)]
*  Because what happened is David Boyce, Bill Clinton's lawyer, Weinstein's lawyer, Uber [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=5.88s)]
*  passed gay marriage in the Supreme Court, Gore's lawyer, Gore V. Bush, and I'm telling [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=10.56s)]
*  you stuff you know, but others might not. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=13.88s)]
*  One of the good guys, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=16.48s)]
*  Big Democrat. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=18.76s)]
*  God, he's the worst. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=19.76s)]
*  He went to Prime Minister Hud Barak, the former Prime Minister of Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=20.8s)]
*  Who should I hire to stop Rose McGowan? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  And when I say this goes up to the highest levels of power, it goes up to the highest [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=25.84s)]
*  levels of power. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=30.36s)]
*  Black Cube, Kroll, and Pelicano do. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=31.72s)]
*  And they terrorized me really intensively, because they knew I was writing a book. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=35.36s)]
*  The irony, I never intended on putting his name in my book. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=41.56s)]
*  The book's not about him. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=44.96s)]
*  It's using the story of what happened to me to educate people further and get to see [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=47.2s)]
*  like the true lie behind the image of Hollywood and Democrats, power structure. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=51.48s)]
*  But I was never going to put his name in my book. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=57.8s)]
*  It's an ugly, disgusting name. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  No, I love words. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  I love words. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=64.28s)]
*  I love language. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=65.64s)]
*  I don't know about you, but when I was writing a book, sometimes it feels like I had like [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=66.64s)]
*  every, like the dictionary sitting on my head and I was like, aw, like, you know, it's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=70.28s)]
*  a lot to write a book. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=75.52s)]
*  A lot. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=77.08s)]
*  Not boring what you're writing, but like you have to sit still. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=79.08s)]
*  You're by yourself. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=81.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, and you're living inside your head. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=82.92s)]
*  Oh no, people think writing is just when you're doing that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=84.08s)]
*  No, like, and I had never written a book. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=86.32s)]
*  I'd never really done a homework assignment. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=88.52s)]
*  My mom when I was 15, she was like, you never finish anything. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=91.16s)]
*  And I was like, oh God, what if that's true? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=93.44s)]
*  You know, on set, I have a contract. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=95.24s)]
*  If I don't show up, I'm getting sued. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=96.24s)]
*  I have people following me with walkie talkies every minute of my day as managed. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=97.8s)]
*  So I didn't know if I really did complete things or not. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=101.96s)]
*  But I did, shockingly. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=104.88s)]
*  But I did it while there were flying drones around my windows every day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=105.88s)]
*  This is three years before 2017, the Weinstein News broke. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  I was trailed, almost driven off the road. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=112.32s)]
*  They stole my headlights out of my car. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=114.8s)]
*  They placed trackers in my car. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=116.16s)]
*  I thought I was manifesting everything in my life. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=117.8s)]
*  Turns out my whole house was bugged. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=120.0s)]
*  I had like that swept. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=122.36s)]
*  Like it would be like I so I am I was exhausted when the news broke. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=123.36s)]
*  And my literary agent, Dupree Miller, Jan Miller, they're big. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=128.88s)]
*  In fact, Weinstein was doing a movie with Trayvon Martin's family. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=132.92s)]
*  It was very sad, actually, with Jay-Z, who also knows. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=136.48s)]
*  And that got killed because the Weinstein, you know, that movie never came out [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=143.16s)]
*  or got finished because of that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=146.76s)]
*  But the literary agency Dupree Miller, Google them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=147.92s)]
*  They're real nice. So Jan Miller, she's like this dragon lady. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=151.56s)]
*  She was like bragging to me about how close she was with Bill and Hillary [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=154.8s)]
*  and her and David Boyce are hanging out that weekend. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=158.16s)]
*  She's throwing a five thousand dollar plate dinner for them in Dallas. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=160.88s)]
*  They're at the race in Dallas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=163.8s)]
*  Now, what was happening at that time, any time I was making a public appearance, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=165.36s)]
*  I knew people were shadowing me. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=170.72s)]
*  My then boyfriend was like, I can't take it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm being followed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  My car is broken into. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=176.16s)]
*  Like, I can't take it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=177.4s)]
*  I'm being driven nuts. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  And this is three years again before the news is breaking. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=180.32s)]
*  But they knew I was writing a book. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=182.52s)]
*  He. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=186.12s)]
*  I just don't watch the story. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=188.4s)]
*  It's exhausting in some ways, but like four days after [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=189.68s)]
*  knocking out Weinstein at the New York Times, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=193.28s)]
*  I iced Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, by tweeting at Jeff Bezos. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=196.0s)]
*  You know, why not? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  One, two, three, four at four points, I was make first. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  You want a dirty Oscar. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=204.6s)]
*  Casey Affleck, like an actor, Ben Affleck's brother, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  who has been accused very credibly and I think did settlements behind the scene. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  I think that's what happened. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=215.68s)]
*  Alleged violent predator. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=218.04s)]
*  Didn't care. It doesn't matter Roy Price, the head of the studio. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  I had already known from just, you know, he was under investigation [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=223.92s)]
*  for a year before the Weinstein News broke by his own company. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  So you told me Jeff Bezos doesn't know who his employer is. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  Really? He was under investigation for a year for sexually harassing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=234.96s)]
*  the head producer of The Man in the High Castle on Amazon, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=239.92s)]
*  who not that it matters, but I think as a married lady, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=244.32s)]
*  I think as a married lesbian by sticking his tongue or something in her ear [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=247.32s)]
*  and like whispering, do you like it in the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=251.48s)]
*  stuff like that every day. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=254.76s)]
*  So she actually filed a sexual harassment thing with HR, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=256.04s)]
*  but they kept it in house. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=258.96s)]
*  But I read about it in the trades, but it didn't make wider news. Right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=260.0s)]
*  So one, you want a dirty Oscar, Jeff Bezos. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=264.28s)]
*  Two, Roy Price, all of a sudden he followed me one day on Twitter. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=267.68s)]
*  It's like two years before the expose. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm like, whoa, the head of Amazon Studios has fired me. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=273.84s)]
*  I've been writing a script about Children of God, the thing I grew up on. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=275.92s)]
*  And, you know, if you've ever written anything, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=280.16s)]
*  how hard it is to get anybody to read the damn thing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  So we start talking on Twitter, DMing, and I'm like, I wrote a script. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=285.44s)]
*  He's like, I would love to read it. I send it to him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=290.32s)]
*  Two days later, I was like, this is amazing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=292.72s)]
*  I'm like the head of a studio within two days read what? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  Huh? Then he does a huge deal with this Roy Price, head of Amazon Studios, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=299.12s)]
*  with Woody Allen. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=304.48s)]
*  See, it's his ass. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=306.92s)]
*  I am at lunch with Roy Price one day at the Beverly Hills Hotel. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=309.04s)]
*  And I just found out that Weinstein was going to go bankrupt. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=314.12s)]
*  And if he'd truly gone bankrupt, I would have just left it there, maybe. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=317.56s)]
*  I was thinking about that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  But he didn't, because Roy Price, Amazon Studios, came in to save him. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  Turns out they bought my script to see at Weinstein's behest. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=328.16s)]
*  To see if I had written anything about him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=333.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=336.92s)]
*  So I... [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=337.92s)]
*  With no intention of using it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=338.92s)]
*  No, just sitting on it so it can never be in circulation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=339.92s)]
*  I'm sorry, I get emotional sometimes because it's like, I work so hard. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6-uLabCYNo&t=341.92s)]
