# Steve Bannon joins Tucker Carlson for first interview since contempt sentencing
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A)
*  Steve Bannon had nothing to do with January 6th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=0.0s)]
*  He wasn't there, he committed no crime, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=3.24s)]
*  but that didn't stop the January 6th committee [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=4.98s)]
*  from trying to destroy him anyway. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=7.12s)]
*  Today, Bannon was sentenced to four months in federal prison [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=9.08s)]
*  at the request of that committee. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=12.1s)]
*  As Congressman Matt Gaetz has pointed out, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=14.16s)]
*  the Department of Justice official [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=16.0s)]
*  who prosecuted Steve Bannon, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=17.52s)]
*  a man called Matthew Graves, is a partisan Democrat. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=19.2s)]
*  He was on Joe Biden's Domestic Policy Committee [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=22.2s)]
*  in the 2020 campaign [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=24.04s)]
*  and worked for other Democratic campaigns. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=25.48s)]
*  So what we're seeing clearly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=28.76s)]
*  is the corruption of the rule of law. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=30.28s)]
*  Congress held Lois Lerner and Eric Holder [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=32.9s)]
*  in contempt famously, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=34.84s)]
*  but of course they never spent a day in jail [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=35.92s)]
*  and they were never going to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=37.44s)]
*  because they were faithful Democrats. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=38.36s)]
*  Tonight, Steve Bannon joins us for his first interview [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=40.28s)]
*  since his sentencing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=42.56s)]
*  Steve Bannon, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=43.800000000000004s)]
*  Do you agree with Matt Gaetz that this is partisan? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=45.72s)]
*  That's 100%. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the whole Justice Department under Merrick Garland [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=51.36s)]
*  has become radically partisan [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  and I think that's after we went on November 8th [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=55.88s)]
*  to deliver this crushing blow [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=58.08s)]
*  against the Democratic Party, this regime talker. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  I strongly believe you'll see Merrick Garland impeached [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=62.56s)]
*  next year by the new Congress. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=65.92s)]
*  I certainly hope so. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=67.84s)]
*  People who say four months in prison is not a big deal [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=68.96s)]
*  had never been to a prison. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=71.24s)]
*  It is a big deal. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=72.36s)]
*  How are you gonna respond to this? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=73.46s)]
*  Do you plan to submit? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=74.8s)]
*  Well, number one, we have the judge laid out today [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=78.4s)]
*  a number of areas of appeal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=80.96s)]
*  I've got a great legal team. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=82.78s)]
*  My legal team's working on the appeals right now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=84.52s)]
*  We've got appeals on use of attorney, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=86.8s)]
*  separation of powers, executive privilege, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=91.0s)]
*  the structure of the January 6th Committee. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=93.36s)]
*  So we've got a lot of appeals. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=96.0s)]
*  We'll work through the appeals process. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=97.2s)]
*  And so this is all, my sentencing is all pending [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=98.52s)]
*  the appeals process and we'll work through it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=101.6s)]
*  Like I said on your show the first time, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=103.62s)]
*  at the end of the day, I gotta go to prison [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=105.72s)]
*  by this illegitimate regime. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=107.88s)]
*  Hey, I respect what the judge did today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=109.28s)]
*  I'm prepared to do it, but we got a long appeals process. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=112.36s)]
*  What do you think this says about our system [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=116.08s)]
*  more broadly, however? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=117.92s)]
*  I mean, you're saying that you're being sent to prison [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=119.48s)]
*  because you advised Donald Trump politically. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=123.36s)]
*  I mean, that doesn't sound like a free country [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=126.68s)]
*  where something like that could happen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=129.6s)]
*  It's not free right now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=132.88s)]
*  You see this in it, whether it's the FBI rolling up [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=134.04s)]
*  individuals praying in front of abortion centers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=137.44s)]
*  or designating parents, going to parents' rights [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=140.04s)]
*  at school board meetings for parents' rights [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=142.96s)]
*  as domestic terrorists, the justice department [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=146.12s)]
*  is completely and totally out of control [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=147.76s)]
*  and the FBI is out of control. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=149.44s)]
*  That's why I'm a big believer in defund the FBI. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=150.6s)]
*  Use the appropriations process to defund [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=153.12s)]
*  both these apparatuses until they come to the table [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=155.8s)]
*  and we start cleaning up the rat's nest. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=158.28s)]
*  I think the only way you're gonna do it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=159.68s)]
*  is you gotta start at the top. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=161.28s)]
*  We gotta impeach Ray and we gotta impeach Merrick Garland [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=162.64s)]
*  after full investigations. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=165.76s)]
*  I think Merrick Garland could be impeached [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=167.48s)]
*  on the southern border. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=169.54s)]
*  I think he can impeach by what he's trying to do [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=170.74s)]
*  to these parents, the parents' rights movement. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  I think that Merrick Garland will be impeached next year [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=175.32s)]
*  by the new Congress. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=177.89999999999998s)]
*  One of the reasons that our system has become partisan [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=180.11999999999998s)]
*  in the rule of law is evaporating [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  is because no one's pushing back against it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=184.88s)]
*  Are you satisfied with the response from elected Republicans [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=186.77999999999997s)]
*  to what's happened to you? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=190.44s)]
*  Is anyone sticking up for you, do you think? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=191.44s)]
*  I think it's fine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  And look, elected Republicans, what they need to do now [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  is focus on the 8th of November. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  Tucker, there's no substitute for victory. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=201.46s)]
*  We have a very good opportunity here [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=203.18s)]
*  to shatter the Democratic Party [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=205.08s)]
*  as a national political institution, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=207.06s)]
*  from school boards to state legislatures [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  to attorney general, secretary of state [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=211.52s)]
*  to take the House by 40 or 50 seats [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=213.66s)]
*  and maybe take the Senate by four or five seats. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=215.96s)]
*  To me, elected officials right now [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  should just focus on winning and winning [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  at the biggest wave we can. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  I can do this myself with my lawyers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  I don't need Republicans having my back. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=227.4s)]
*  What I want Republicans to do is in the new Congress [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=228.9s)]
*  is to focus on cleaning out the rat's nest at DOJ [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=232.46s)]
*  and clean out the rat's nest at the FBI. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=235.66s)]
*  If you're Lois Lerner or you're Eric Holder, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  both of whom committed, from my read, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=240.62s)]
*  actual crimes against the country, unlike you, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=243.22s)]
*  you have not been accused even of doing that, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=245.66s)]
*  and both of them skated on contempt charges, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=247.46s)]
*  do you think they're ashamed? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=250.62s)]
*  Do they see the double standard? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=252.5s)]
*  Has either one reached out to you to commiserate with you? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=253.78s)]
*  I'm serious, like on a human level. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  No, look, as you know, the city is so partisan, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=259.06s)]
*  this process now is so partisan, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=263.58s)]
*  and they are some of the most partisan people, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=265.34s)]
*  especially Eric Holder. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=266.94s)]
*  Eric Holder is the hatchet man for Obama. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=268.34s)]
*  So no, they didn't, and by the way, I wouldn't want them to. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=270.78s)]
*  Right now, hey, this is an unbridgeable gap. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=273.82s)]
*  You have the Republicans and the MAGA forces on one side, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=276.62s)]
*  you have these radical Democrats on another, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  you see this is not rule of law, it's like a banana republic. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  You can't compromise in this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=285.29999999999995s)]
*  There's no substitute for victory. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=286.97999999999996s)]
*  We have to win massively on the eighth, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=289.26s)]
*  and then this new Congress has to really go [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  and enforce the rule of law. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  And the way you enforce the rule of law [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=294.58s)]
*  is start serious investigations, not political, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=296.3s)]
*  serious investigations, Tucker, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=299.02s)]

*  start bringing articles of impeachment [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=302.38s)]
*  and throw these bums out, whether it's Majorca's at DHS [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDC-_3G95A&t=304.41999999999996s)]
