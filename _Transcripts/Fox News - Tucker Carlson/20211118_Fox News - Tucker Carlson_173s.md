# Tucker: These people are too stupid to be real
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY)
*  So it's interesting, inflation is obviously going up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=0.0s)]
*  They say it's a little over 6%. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=2.56s)]
*  It's clearly much higher than that in some places [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=4.04s)]
*  with some products. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=7.32s)]
*  No one likes this, except people who have massive amounts [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=10.42s)]
*  of debt that is certainly costing them less to pay off. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=12.96s)]
*  But the average person is hurt by this and hates it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=16.46s)]
*  And maybe that's why the people who know better than you [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=19.36s)]
*  are suddenly telling you that inflation's great. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=21.92s)]
*  It's good that everything costs more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=24.88s)]
*  You do make a really good point that inflation as a product [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=27.8s)]
*  of demand has an upside, correct? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=31.12s)]
*  Right, to the extent that it's coming from a strong economy, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=36.08s)]
*  a strong consumer, that's not a bad thing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  This is the fastest recovery right now in recent memory. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=43.3s)]
*  Demand is high. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Wages for the bottom 40% of workers are rising very fast, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=48.2s)]
*  fast enough to help overcome what is the big central problem [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=51.58s)]
*  that everyone is rightly discussing right now, inflation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=55.46s)]
*  While nobody likes to pay more, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=58.82s)]
*  on average we have the money to do so. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=61.22s)]
*  Household savings hit a record high. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=63.78s)]
*  So Republicans want you to believe the economy [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=65.9s)]
*  isn't doing well, that's terrible. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=67.54s)]
*  But in reality, unemployment is at its lowest point [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=68.7s)]
*  since before the pandemic began. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=71.14s)]
*  So the economy isn't bad, it's just that people are mad [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=72.5s)]
*  because everything is late [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=76.18s)]
*  and things cost a little bit more. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=77.14s)]
*  These people are so partisan, they'll literally say anything. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=79.66s)]
*  They'll look right into the camera and lie [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=83.7s)]
*  as long as it helps their political candidate, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=86.54s)]
*  in this case, Joe Biden. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=88.78s)]
*  I mean, you gotta think if people started to starve to death, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=90.7s)]
*  they would tell you it's good because the country's too fat. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=93.54s)]
*  Over at CNN, one of their anchors just tweeted a picture [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=96.78s)]
*  of refrigerators stocked with milk. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=99.3s)]
*  He said, that's proof there is no supply chain crisis [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=100.9s)]
*  because of course we import all of our milk from China. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=103.7s)]
*  These people are too stupid to be real. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=106.14s)]
*  Meanwhile, Joe Biden's nominee to a top treasury post, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  a communist sympathizer called Soleil Amarova, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=111.06s)]
*  is refusing to say whether she believes high gas prices [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=114.38s)]
*  are bad for the country. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=119.14s)]
*  Dr. Amarova, do you think that higher gas prices [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=120.34s)]
*  are good for America or bad for America? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  Yes or no answer would be fine there. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=125.06s)]
*  Senator, that's a tricky question [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=130.06s)]
*  because I do remember, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  higher gas prices good for America [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  or bad for America, doctor? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=137.1s)]
*  It's probably bad for America. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  It's not my expertise. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=141.14s)]
*  I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=142.38s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I'd let the record reflect [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=144.7s)]
*  that this witness is having a hard time acknowledging [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=147.14s)]
*  that higher gas prices are bad for America. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=149.82s)]
*  Are higher gas prices bad for America? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=153.14s)]
*  Well, it's a tricky question. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=155.26s)]
*  I guess they're bad. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=156.42s)]
*  She doesn't care. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=157.78s)]
*  None of them care. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=158.62s)]
*  There are four higher gas prices. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=159.44s)]
*  They're for ending the energy industry, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=161.18s)]
*  which by the way is our last functioning sector [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=163.62s)]
*  of the economy in the United States. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=166.5s)]
*  There'll be real poverty if they succeed in doing that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=168.58s)]
*  In the meantime, they just don't care [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=170.94000000000003s)]
*  about its effect on you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_nitSCNRDY&t=171.98000000000002s)]
