# Tucker Carlson: Biden has made things a lot worse
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Today we do not want to deliver another depressing show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=0.0s)]
*  and we won't. But if you're looking at the country and thinking how do we measure the health of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=4.0s)]
*  United States, there are pretty obvious ways to do it. The average life expectancy is one, the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=8.4s)]
*  marriage rate, the effectiveness of the U.S. military, housing costs, the value of the U.S. dollar, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=12.64s)]
*  the health of the financial markets, the safety of our streets, etc. By every single one of those [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=18.16s)]
*  very basic measures, the Biden administration has failed and done so dramatically. Biden isn't [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=22.64s)]
*  simply incompetent, though obviously he is. Biden is the single most destructive force in the history [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=27.6s)]
*  of the United States. In just a year and a half, Biden and Ron Klain, his strange shadowy chief of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=32.0s)]
*  staff, have done more damage to this country than anybody could possibly have imagined. We read the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=38.24s)]
*  numbers every night, but they don't capture it. You know what captures it? This story. This story [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  comes from the reliably liberal financial news outlet CNBC. Here's the second sentence of the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=48.8s)]
*  piece. Quote, a rising number of former Californians are migrating out of the country altogether [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=53.6s)]
*  and are instead heading south of the border. Many are seeking a more relaxed and affordable [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=60.24s)]
*  lifestyle in Mexico. Yes, in Mexico, not Switzerland, Mexico. So things are so bad in Joe Biden's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=64.56s)]
*  America that thousands of Americans are voluntarily moving to a third world country in the middle of a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=72.48s)]
*  brutal drug war. Yes, there are human heads littering the side of the road in Acapulco, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=77.2s)]
*  but at least it's not Los Angeles. Darrell Graham works in real estate in Mexico. He says of the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=81.84s)]
*  people he sells to, quote, at least half are coming down from California. Suddenly the cost of taxes, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=87.2s)]
*  the crime rates, the politics, all the things that people are unhappy with in California make [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=93.04s)]
*  them want to come down to Mexico. Another analyst who studies the trend at the Migration Policy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  Institute says so many Americans are relocating to Mexico right now that locals are being priced out [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=102.72s)]
*  of their own neighborhoods. So it's mass migration in reverse. It's pretty amazing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=108.4s)]
*  No matter how bad you thought this administration was going to be, you probably could not have [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  imagined ever caravans of Biden refugees fleeing our country across the southern border looking [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  for a better life in Mexico. At this rate, the next stop will be Port-au-Prince. Say what you [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=126.0s)]
*  all about Haiti, it's better than Baltimore. Now, one upside of moving to Latin America is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=130.56s)]
*  like-minded neighbors. Hispanics despise Joe Biden too. Biden's approval rating among Hispanic [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=135.84s)]
*  voters in this country has fallen to 24%. That's his lowest among any demographic group. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=141.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, as of tonight, guess who's the preferred candidate for 2024 among self-described [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=147.6s)]
*  Latinos? That's right, the Taco Bowl guy, Donald J. Trump. Let that sink in for a second. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=153.04s)]
*  Donald Trump, supposedly the most anti-Hispanic racist this country's ever produced, that man [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=160.08s)]
*  is far more popular among actual Hispanics than a cringing white liberal like Joe Biden. So the guy [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=165.84s)]
*  who tried to build a border wall is loved. The guy who uses the words Latinx, non-ironically, is hated. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=172.0s)]
*  Remarkable. It's also, and this is not an overstatement politically, a disaster of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=179.04s)]
*  generational magnitude for the Democratic Party. Latinos dislike Joe Biden intensely and they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=184.16s)]
*  dislike him for the same reason that everybody else does. Biden has made things worse, a lot worse. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=189.76s)]
*  The median income in this country is $44,000 a year. A year? Imagine trying to live on that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=194.96s)]
*  right now. Do the math. You couldn't do it, not in any recognizably American way. Inflation is too high. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  It's making you poorer. Well, today in Philadelphia, Joe Biden unveiled his plan to fix inflation. Now [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=208.56s)]
*  watch this tape and keep in mind as you do that it is real. We've not edited it in any way. Here it is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  We can do all this. I'm asking, all I'm asking is for the largest corporations and the wealthiest [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=219.2s)]
*  Americans to begin to pay their fair share in taxes. I'm deadly earnest. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=227.44s)]
*  Anybody out there think the tax system is fair? Raise your hand. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  This guy, the AFL-CIO, how many private sector labor union members support Joe Biden? 12%, 15%? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not 50%. And yet they host the guy? They're so corrupt. But listen to the message. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=257.12s)]
*  Higher taxes will make the things that you buy cheaper. That's what Biden just said. Inflation is [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=263.36s)]
*  up because taxes aren't high enough. Now it's hardly a defense of corporate America, which we [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=268.72s)]
*  would never defend, to point out that that as an economic analysis is completely insane. It's not [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=273.04s)]
*  true. We've lost control of inflation because people like Joe Biden pushed a species of lunacy [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  called modern monetary theory. They printed an endless torrent of fake money to enrich and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=282.88s)]
*  empower themselves. And by doing that, they crashed the US dollar and made you much poorer. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=288.72s)]
*  That's what happened. There's not much debate about that. And they're not going to acknowledge [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=293.36s)]
*  it, of course. They can't even be bothered to pretend to care about baby formula shortages. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=297.6s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden's publicist just yesterday. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  Okay. I don't have anything new. I know we made some announcements last week. I just don't have [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=327.6s)]
*  them in front of me. Oh, mothers can't feed their babies. Let me see what I have here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  Somehow the White House communications team forgot to load the baby formula talking points into the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  binder, leaving our historic LGBTQ plus immigrant glass ceiling shattering press secretary speechless. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=350.88s)]
*  I just don't have them in front of me. In other words, what does that question have to do with [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=356.56s)]
*  trans rights? Nothing. Okay. Next. The one thing Corrine Jean-Pierre can say with dead certainty is [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=360.48s)]
*  that Joe Biden is great. Joe Biden is energetic. He's fully in charge of his faculties. In fact, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=366.8s)]
*  he's planning on running again in 2024, by which time all of suburban Chicago will have moved to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=371.76s)]
*  Haiti in search of a higher standard of living. She actually said that, quote, to be clear, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=377.2s)]
*  as the president himself has said repeatedly, he plans to run in 2024. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=382.64s)]
*  We can just guess how you feel about that, but how do leaders of the Democratic Party feel about [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=387.68s)]
*  that? He's their guy, and yet they're horrified by it. Even Sandy Cortez, who can defend anything [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  if she has to, up to and including another pointless neocon war in Ukraine, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=397.28s)]
*  even she can't get behind another Joe Biden run. Watch. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=401.52s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we get to it, but I think if the president has a vision, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=406.24s)]
*  and that's something certainly we're all willing to entertain and examine when the time comes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=411.04s)]
*  That's not a yes. I believe that the president has been doing a very good job [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  so far, and should he run again, I think that we'll take a look at it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=420.88s)]
*  Yeah, we'll cross that bridge. We'll take a look at it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=429.92s)]
*  So what they're really saying, and this is their latest talking point, is we don't like Joe Biden, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  and we never have. They've got nothing to do with Joe Biden, it turns out. David Axelrod and Joe [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=437.84s)]
*  Scarborough and the other professional liars who foisted this senile mannequin on America are now [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  trying to run away from him. The New York Times, which is their newsletter, ran a front page story [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  two days ago on Sunday about Joe Biden's mental decline. Really? That topic was completely off [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=451.67999999999995s)]
*  limits just a year ago. You couldn't say it. The New York Times quoted one DNC official who's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=457.35999999999996s)]
*  advising Biden to announce now, right after the midterms, that he's not running again. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  As David Axelrod, mastermind of the Obama victories, put it himself, quote, the presidency is a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=467.12s)]
*  monstrously taxing job, and the stark reality is the president would be closer to 90 than 80 [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=472.88s)]
*  at the end of a second term, and that would be a major issue. In other words, he's too freaking [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=478.24s)]
*  old. Biden's got dementia. Who knew? Well, actually, they all knew, and they all knew all along, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=483.76s)]
*  and they should not be allowed at this late date to evade their culpability for knowing and lying [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=490.0s)]
*  about it. They committed this crime. These people are cynical, they're ruthless, they're morally [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=494.4s)]
*  disfigured, and if you need more proof of that, consider how they're treating poor Kamala Harris. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=499.44s)]
*  They've abandoned Kamala Harris completely. It's shocking, really, given that just 18 months ago, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  these very same people were yelling at you about how lucky you were to have this historically [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  Indian black female vice president, the very first in history. It was thrilling. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=513.52s)]
*  That got emotional just thinking about it. Kamala Harris was that wonderful. Here's a recap. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=517.6s)]
*  Kamala Harris is being sworn in, the first woman vice president. And our first woman vice president. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=522.32s)]
*  We'll see our first woman vice president. It will be a historic day. Kamala Harris will be the first [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=528.96s)]
*  woman vice president of the United States. We mark the swearing in of the first woman in American [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=534.0s)]
*  history elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  Don't tell me things can't change. Oh, they can change, and they have. That was just the other [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=547.2800000000001s)]
*  day. We were getting goosebumps listening to it, but now they're ghosting Kamala Harris like a bad [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=551.52s)]
*  Tinder date. They're pretending she doesn't exist. In effect, in doing that, the Democratic party is [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=556.24s)]
*  embracing white supremacy. How? Well, Democratic party leaders plan to deny Harris a job that she [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  has earned as Democratic nominee and replace her in the next cycle with yet another, wait for it now, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=568.72s)]
*  white man. Let's try Beto. How about Mayor Pete? Notice a theme here? Pale and male. Is there forever [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=574.16s)]
*  telling us? Because it turns out diversity isn't actually our strength. Equity inclusion are fine [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=579.68s)]
*  if you're hiring middle managers at a big company. You would never hire a middle-aged white guy at [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  Citibank. That's probably illegal. Same with the airlines and hospitals. We've got way too many [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=590.16s)]
*  white male pilots and heart surgeons and Supreme Court justices. The Biden administration tells us [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=594.8s)]
*  that constantly they seem to mean that they use DOJ to enforce their rules. Yet somehow the most [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=599.28s)]
*  anti-white political party in the English-speaking world is suddenly pushing another white man for [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=606.88s)]
*  president. How does that work? Joe Biden and friends. Ron Klain. Well, it turns out the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=611.2s)]
*  presidency is a different thing. A firm of action is essential for vice presidents. Obviously, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=616.56s)]
*  that's how we got Kamala Harris in the first place, but not for presidents. Presidents have too much [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=621.04s)]
*  power. So the usual diversity standards don't apply. We've had 46 male white male presidents in a row, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=624.56s)]
*  and the Democratic party wants you to have another. Not so fast, racists. Hold on a second. Now, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=630.56s)]
*  the rest of official Washington may be completely on board with this coup against Kamala Harris, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=638.56s)]
*  who again earned the job. They may be willing to stand back and allow America's highest ranking [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=644.0s)]
*  woman of color to be degraded and humiliated in the pages of the New York Times, but we're not. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=649.52s)]
*  We believe Kamala Harris is a human being with hopes and dreams and aspirations. She's a first [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=654.2399999999999s)]
*  in so many ways. She celebrated Kwanzaa before it was even invented. And of course, now that Oprah [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=660.8s)]
*  is retired, Kamala Harris is America's main source of life-affirming aphorisms that don't actually [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=665.6s)]
*  mean anything. Watch this montage, which we have lovingly collected, and ask yourself how anyone [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=669.92s)]
*  could stand in the way of this woman becoming president of the United States. You know, when we [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=675.68s)]
*  talk about our children, I know for this group, we all believe that when we talk about the children [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  of the community, they are the children of the community. And so what we all experienced is [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=684.64s)]
*  on an electric school bus, on an electric bus, no exhaust, no diesel smell. It is time for us to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=692.16s)]
*  do what we have been doing, and that time is every day. Every day it is time for us to agree. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  This whole thing about the border, we've been to the border. We've been to the border. You haven't [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=709.92s)]
*  been to the border. And I haven't been to Europe. And I mean, I don't think you guys, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=714.4s)]
*  and my pronouns are she, her and hers. She, her and hers? She would look down at me and Kamala, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=720.48s)]
*  what do you want? What do you want? And I look back up at her and I said, freedom! [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=726.24s)]
*  You're gonna literally see the craters on the moon with your own eyes. With your own eyes, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=732.72s)]
*  I'm telling you. We must together, work together to see where we are, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=739.92s)]
*  where we are headed, but also see it as a moment, yes, to together. It is the perspective of a woman [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=746.24s)]
*  who grew up a black child in America, who was also a prosecutor, who also has a mother who arrived [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=754.8s)]
*  here at the age of 19 from India, who also, you know, likes hip hop. What do you want to know? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=763.28s)]
*  What do you want to know? She's unbelievable. You would deny that person a chance to serve? That is [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=772.0s)]
*  the person the Democratic insiders are tonight, ladies and gentlemen, trying to remove from the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=781.04s)]
*  public stage. And if no one else will say it, we will. It's wrong. Despite appearances, Kamala [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=785.76s)]
*  Harris is not a disposable consumer product. She's a pioneer. Do you know what she went through [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=789.92s)]
*  trying to get a fair shake in a systemically racist country as the daughter of college professors? It [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=795.12s)]
*  wasn't easy. You know how hard she worked? At one point, she even dated Montel Williams. Few would [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=798.7199999999999s)]
*  go that far, but Kamala Harris did. No wonder she's sick and tired of being sick and tired. We get it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=803.5999999999999s)]
*  Watch as she did the work and unpacked her generational trauma live on television for you. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=809.36s)]
*  You know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=814.08s)]
*  public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=821.6s)]
*  Yeah, that little girl was me. Now that little girl actually grew up in French-speaking Canada, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  not in the Jim Crow South, but whatever. Look what she's become. Now, simply because she's a [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=833.36s)]
*  moron and no one likes her, even agrees on how to pronounce her first name, the Democratic party is [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=838.1600000000001s)]
*  trying to throw Harris away, toss her out the window like a used Big Mac rapper. Now, Kamala [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=841.76s)]
*  Harris may be stained with secret sauce, but she deserves more than that. Yes, she does. Mediocrity [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=847.52s)]
*  is no excuse for firing someone. A low IQ, a terrible personality, a total inability to do the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=853.04s)]
*  prescribed job. Those are not reasons to deny someone a job. The Biden administration has told [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=859.6s)]
*  us that repeatedly. By the way, democracy plays a role in this too. You just saw the woman who [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=864.88s)]
*  Liz Cheney tells us a lot got 81 million votes in the last election. Now, that's the most votes of [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=869.6s)]
*  any vice president in history. That's more votes than Liz Cheney's dad got. So denying Kamala Harris [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=875.84s)]
*  the Democratic nomination in 2024 is nothing less than a form of insurrection. It's an attack on [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=881.36s)]
*  democracy and on our sacred norms. It's disinformation, probably Russian in origin. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=887.2s)]
*  Whatever it is, we cannot allow it. And as long as this show is on the air, we won't. Tonight, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=891.44s)]
*  we are endorsing Kamala D. Harris for the 2024 Democratic primaries. She deserves it. And so [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=897.68s)]
*  do Democrats. They created her. They should be forced to live with her. And anyone who disagrees [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3PS2bxfWVA&t=903.76s)]
