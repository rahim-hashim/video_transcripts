# Dr. Siegel on Biden's health: It's not about age, it's about fitness
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U)
*  Joe Biden, speaking of, had the second physical of his presidency today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=0.0s)]
*  It was conducted at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, as it's now called. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=3.5s)]
*  According to the White House physician, the physical demonstrates that Joe Biden is, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  when we're quoting, a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male, which may seem a little bit like some oxymoron, but whatever. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=11.72s)]
*  He has AFib, spinal arthritis, and a few other conditions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=19.02s)]
*  Apparently, he did not take, notably, a cognitive test. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=22.1s)]
*  The White House is not making the White House physician available for questions, of course. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=25.5s)]
*  But we have, thank heaven, Dr. Mark Siegel to assess. He joins us tonight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  Doctor, thanks for coming on. What do you make of this? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=33.96s)]
*  Tucker, you already got the key point, which is this physical exam is more significant for what it leaves out than what it actually tells us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=36.1s)]
*  And it tells us he's got allergies, he's got reflux, he's got spinal stenosis in his spine, he has arthritis in his spine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=43.6s)]
*  And they're trying to say on this physical something that we've been talking about for a year, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=51.7s)]
*  which is where's the stiff gait he has coming from, and they're saying it's coming from peripheral neuropathy, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=57.2s)]
*  meaning loss of sensation in his feet, which they don't know where that's coming from, and arthritis in the spine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=63.2s)]
*  Here's my problem with that. They're basing that on a physical examination of multiple doctors, but no MRI. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=68.9s)]
*  I don't see anywhere in there about an MRI. Since the 1980s, I want to tell you, Dr. O'Connor, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=76.2s)]
*  we don't just examine patients extensively and say no multiple sclerosis, no stroke, you know, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=82.69999999999999s)]
*  no problems with water on the brain that could be causing cognitive problems. We do an MRI. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=88.5s)]
*  Where's the MRI? And also, you already said it, where's the cognitive test? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  We have a cognitive error a day, at least, from this president, who the other day said 20,000 pounds of Fentanyl was enough to kill a thousand people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=99.0s)]
*  How about four billion people? Or he calls Kamala Harris the president, or he forgets a congressperson's name, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=107.6s)]
*  or one that has died he thinks is in the audience. I mean, this is really extensive, and it's getting worse. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=113.4s)]
*  His own son, who he named the cancer moonshot after he says died in Iraq. This has got to be examined. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=118.7s)]
*  And then listen to this. A stiff gait is sometimes a sign of cognitive problems. An MRI, a cognitive test. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=124.5s)]
*  Now listen, Tucker, I know 80-year-olds that are operating still. We know 90-year-olds who are amazing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=132.3s)]
*  But it's not about age, even though most Americans say he's too old to run again. I say it's about fitness, Tucker. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=138.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's so obvious that it's insulting, really, to the rest of us. We appreciate your expertise in analyzing these so-called results. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=144.9s)]
*  Dr. Mark Siegel, thank you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVyI90cX-8U&t=162.3s)]
