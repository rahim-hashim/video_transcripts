# New York Times ripped over summit featuring Zelenskyy, Bankman-Fried
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js)
*  So Sam Bankman Fried, as we just told you at some length, was the headliner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=0.0s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried, everybody! [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=4.34s)]
*  Applause, applause, applause! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=6.08s)]
*  At the New York Times Dealbook Summit a few hours ago, was a top business leader. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=7.68s)]
*  Can't overstate how weird it was. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=12.88s)]
*  At one point, Andrew Sorkin from the New York Times, who promoted Sam Bankman Fried [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=14.18s)]
*  on television at length in previous months and years, asked how customers could learn [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=19.88s)]
*  to be safe on the line, as if Sam Bankman Fried just didn't rip off his own customers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=24.96s)]
*  But the main takeaway from the whole thing is that Sam Bankman Fried isn't stupid. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=30.72s)]
*  He knows he's bulletproof. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=36.4s)]
*  He knows the Democratic Party and the SEC and his friend Gary Gensler won't touch him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=38.4s)]
*  So watch Sam Bankman Fried explain that actually he's not very worried about criminal charges. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=43.36s)]
*  How concerned are you about criminal liability at this point? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=49.28s)]
*  So I don't think that, I mean obviously I don't personally think that I have, you know, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=52.92s)]
*  but I think the real answer is that's not, it sounds weird to say, but I think the real [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=59.68s)]
*  answer is that's not what I'm focusing on. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=66.58s)]
*  I mean look, I've had a bad month. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=69.32s)]
*  This is not the name of the time for me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=71.2s)]
*  But that's not what matters here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=73.92s)]
*  I've had a bad month. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  It's all about me and my personal journey, but being held accountable by regulators, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=78.92s)]
*  the Justice Department, the U.S. Congress, these are my friends. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=83.88s)]
*  I paid for them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=86.44s)]
*  Boy, if there's ever been a clear window into the deep corruption we really need to get [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=87.76s)]
*  rid of if we're going to return to representative democracy, it's that right there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=92.28s)]
*  So Sam Bankman Fried seems so confident that he's untouchable that he admitted in public [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=97.44s)]
*  to commiggling funds between FTX, his crypto exchange, and a separate company he controlled. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=102.28s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that regulators would normally care about, but in this case for [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  some reason didn't. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=112.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=113.44s)]
*  FTX didn't have bank accounts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=114.44s)]
*  It didn't have any bank accounts globally. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  We were trying to get them. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  It took us a while, took us a few years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=121.78s)]
*  And you know, there are customers who wanted to wire money to FTX. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=125.16s)]
*  And so I think in the meantime, some of them were wiring money to Alameda Research to get [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=130.0s)]
*  credited on FTX. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=135.16s)]
*  And I think that was a substantial sum. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=137.64s)]
*  And I think that the FTX's internal accounting did correctly, effectively try to debit Alameda [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=142.36s)]
*  for those funds. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=149.32s)]
*  You know, the New York Times is not a TV show, it's a newspaper. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=152.8s)]
*  And when they want to find out about somebody, we can speak for firsthand experience, they [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=155.52s)]
*  put a whole bunch of reporters on the story for months and they may interview the person [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=159.28s)]
*  they're writing about. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=163.84s)]
*  They also interview a lot of other people and they create a full account of what they [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=164.84s)]
*  claimed happened. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=168.48s)]
*  They're not doing that with this guy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=169.48s)]
*  They're bringing him on to allow him to whitewash what he did. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=171.16s)]
*  But aware that he may have had a bad week, as he just said, Bankman Fried tried to do [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=178.84s)]
*  some damage control. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=183.28s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=184.28s)]
*  Was there commingling of funds? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=185.76s)]
*  That's what it appears like. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=187.76s)]
*  There's a genuine commingling of the funds that are FTX customers that were not supposed [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  to be commingled with your separate firm. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=195.72s)]
*  I ain't knowingly commingle funds. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=200.72s)]
*  I wasn't trying to commingle funds. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=202.36s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy is the founder and executive chairman of Strive Asset Management and deeply [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=206.4s)]
*  familiar with the world of finance. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=211.24s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  Vivek, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  What was lacking, I felt in all of this, was the moral outrage you would associate with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=216.16s)]
*  someone who apparently stole billions from retirement funds. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=221.12s)]
*  But the New York Times treated him like, yeah, maybe he got a little... [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=224.72s)]
*  You did some bad things or whatever, but there's no... [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=227.68s)]
*  It's not like he's Donald Trump or something. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  What is that? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=233.72s)]
*  The thing that was striking about this, Tucker, is it actually reminded me of a lot of what [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=234.72s)]
*  we saw in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, where you had firms that, again, positioned [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  themselves like they wanted to be the good guys, the Goldman Sachs's, the Morgan Stanleys. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=244.88000000000002s)]
*  And in fact, the difference back then was that they even got bailed out by the government [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  directly at the public fisc. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=252.52s)]
*  Now, here in the case of SBF, this is a guy who wore a t-shirt and shorts. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=253.52s)]
*  And the thing that was fascinating for me for watching that, Tucker, today wasn't so [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=257.68s)]
*  much SBF. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=260.72s)]
*  He's really good at deflection, using a lot of technocratic language to deflect accountability. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=262.04s)]
*  The thing that was actually interesting was looking at the people in the audience, nervously [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  laughing, distancing themselves from him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  And to me, when I was thinking about what happened in 2008, Tucker, I think the interesting [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=272.24s)]
*  part of this is the people in that audience, the other financial elites who now are trying [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  to distance themselves from the guy who wore a t-shirt and shorts, actually are not all [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=279.68s)]
*  that different from him in kind. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=284.32s)]
*  They may be different in degree, but not in kind. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=286.96s)]
*  And I think that's the thing that people actually struggle with with this SBF story, if they're [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=289.62s)]
*  in elite finance. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=292.8s)]
*  When they look themselves in the mirror and look at the kinds of things that happened [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=294.08s)]
*  in 2008, you know what? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=296.56s)]
*  It's an uncomfortable parallel and an uncomfortable similarity. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=298.44s)]
*  And in a certain sense, he's just one of them and they're just one of him. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=301.56s)]
*  That was one of my takeaways from actually watching today. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=305.36s)]
*  That's the deepest truth of this whole thing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=307.4s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=310.16s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, thank you for your insightful analysis of that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=311.16s)]
*  Speaking from knowledge. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=314.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=315.24s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=316.24s)]

*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-AWeXoW0js&t=324.84s)]
