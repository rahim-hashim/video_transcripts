# Rep. Andy Biggs responds to Hogg interruption
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo)
*  Today, Congressman Andy Biggs made that point. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=0.0s)]
*  He was then interrupted by our own Greta Thunberg, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=2.36s)]
*  the creepy little publicity seeker David Hogg. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Remember him? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  It's purposeful on the part of the federal government, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=11.52s)]
*  which has basically sanctioned this invasion, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=13.96s)]
*  and it's purposeful. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Interrating the points of mass shooters in your manifesto. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=24.2s)]
*  The shooter in my high school, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=27.36s)]
*  anti-Semitic, anti-black, and racist. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=28.7s)]
*  The shooter in El Paso described it as an invasion. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=34.1s)]
*  Those guns are coming from the United States of America. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=34.94s)]
*  They are coming from Mexico. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=38.14s)]
*  They are not coming from Mexico. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  You are reiterating the flight of a mass shooter, sir. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=43.62s)]
*  Sir, you are perpetuating this violence. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=46.94s)]
*  He got the low IQ Harvard students screaming about, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=49.94s)]
*  race, race, race, race, race, race, race, race, race, race, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=54.66s)]
*  other self-righteous child who has no idea [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=57.22s)]
*  what he's talking about. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=59.06s)]
*  But David Hogg, appropriately named character, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=60.46s)]
*  obstructed an official congressional proceeding. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=63.54s)]
*  Wow, that sounds like insurrection. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=65.9s)]
*  Liz Cheney, Liz Cheney, isn't that a crime? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=68.3s)]
*  Is this insurrection is gonna face charges? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=71.86s)]
*  Liz Cheney. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=73.58s)]
*  Well, Andy Biggs is the member of Congress [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=75.18s)]
*  whose official business was interrupted by this insurrection. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=77.3s)]
*  He represents Arizona in the US Congress. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=82.38s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=83.94s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=84.78s)]
*  I found it interesting that rather, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you were making, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  people could disagree with the point you were making, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=90.34s)]
*  but it was kind of a logical one. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=91.62s)]
*  He didn't respond to a single point [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=93.34s)]
*  and just start screaming about racism. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=94.62s)]
*  Am I missing something? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=97.06s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=97.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what it was. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=99.22s)]
*  I mean, he's saying that I'm a terrorist manifesto, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=100.82s)]
*  toten, conspiracy nut. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=105.18s)]
*  And the reality is, he's, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=107.38s)]
*  all he was is he wants to get on TV [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=109.46s)]
*  and he wanted to advocate for a nutty position. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=111.82s)]
*  And you're right, as a number of us raised, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=115.5s)]
*  he interrupted our proceeding. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=118.9s)]
*  And Democrats have said, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=121.04s)]
*  if you interrupt a congressional proceeding, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=122.1s)]
*  that's the definition of insurrection. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=124.02s)]
*  And so the police had to take him out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=126.1s)]
*  He was invited there by the Democrats. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=128.94s)]
*  That's what I'm informed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=130.74s)]
*  And so he's trying to grift on this whole thing, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=132.12s)]
*  it looks like. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=134.22s)]
*  And he should probably be brought up in charges. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=135.44s)]
*  Where is that J6 committee when you need him? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=138.94s)]
*  That kid, and I know a lot of your colleagues [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=142.06s)]
*  who went to Harvard and a lot of Americans [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=144.14s)]
*  still think it's impressive. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=145.66s)]
*  At some point, knowing that kid got into Harvard, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  can we just all admit it's actually [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=149.98s)]
*  kind of a mediocre joke or no? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=151.5s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=154.05999999999997s)]
*  Harvard has gone the way of all the woke [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=155.66s)]
*  post-secondary institutions in the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=159.82s)]
*  There's very few of them that aren't gonna turn out [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  somebody who's as radical as that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=164.06s)]
*  And, you know, stoking the fire like that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=166.14s)]
*  is what the Democrats did. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=168.76s)]
*  That's why they wanted him there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  They were hoping for that kind of incident. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=171.98s)]
*  I think that kid's too dumb to host a cable news show, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  and that's saying a lot. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=177.14s)]
*  Ha ha ha, Congressman Andy Vicks, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=178.38s)]
*  intact after his meeting with David Hogg. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=180.94s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeoR4xPj0Bo&t=184.17999999999998s)]
