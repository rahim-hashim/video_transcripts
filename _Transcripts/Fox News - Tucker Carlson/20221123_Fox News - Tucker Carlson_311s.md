# CME Group chief reacts to Sam Bankman-Fried scandal
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU)
*  Well, for the last several years, pretty much every investment bank and business journalist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=0.0s)]
*  in the United States has joined in the ongoing orgy of praise for a man called Sam Bankmanfried, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  the head of the crypto exchange FTX. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=11.08s)]
*  Somehow no one noticed that he was basically a child wearing shorts who played video games [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=13.84s)]
*  during interviews and didn't seem to understand how his company was making money. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=17.44s)]
*  But they lauded him as the world's first future trillionaire. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=21.04s)]
*  They all fell for it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=24.36s)]
*  Well, not all. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=25.36s)]
*  But very few didn't. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=26.36s)]
*  They saw right through it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=27.64s)]
*  Bill Musk, for example, said he took one look at Bankmanfried and his BS detector went off. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=28.64s)]
*  And then, at much greater length and depth, last March, the CEO of CME Group, a man called [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=34.8s)]
*  Terry Duffy, met with Sam Bankmanfried. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=40.24s)]
*  And during that meeting, Duffy did what pretty much nobody else did, maybe nobody else at [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=43.32s)]
*  all ever did. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=47.38s)]
*  He called Sam Bankmanfried a quote, absolute fraud to his face, which of course he turned [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  out to be. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=52.32s)]
*  Then in May, Terry Duffy kept going. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=53.32s)]
*  He tried to warn Congress about FTX and Sam Bankmanfried. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=55.04s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=59.32s)]
*  I'm asking you, sir, you have a saying so that FTX has, quote, no capital requirements [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=60.32s)]
*  for participants. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=66.56s)]
*  I think that's on its face a false statement, given that the CFTC Part 39 regulation requires [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=67.56s)]
*  capital requirements and FTX does have a capital requirement for margins. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=76.56s)]
*  I said their capital requirements are not the same as they are for other institutions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=82.12s)]
*  Capital is not the same as margin, Congressman. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=88.44s)]
*  So Ro Khanna, Democrat of Silicon Valley, getting emotional as he defends Sam Bankmanfried [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=92.72s)]
*  and FTX. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=99.2s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=100.2s)]
*  Maybe someone will do a story to find out why. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=101.2s)]
*  But in the meantime, we are grateful to have Terry Duffy join us, the CEO of CME Group, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=102.48s)]
*  a man who has been completely vindicated. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=107.4s)]
*  Why do you... [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=109.68s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on tonight. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=111.28s)]
*  And by the way, I should recommend to our viewers, there's a whole lot of tape that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=112.28s)]
*  we don't have time to play of you making this case at great length on the Internet, and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=115.4s)]
*  it's worth watching. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  But why do you think you're one of the only people to get this right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  I don't know, Tucker. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=124.68s)]
*  It's a great question, but I appreciate you having me on. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  I appreciate you playing that piece with the genius from California that tell me how crypto [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=128.24s)]
*  markets work and the difference between capital. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=133.28s)]
*  What I was referring to is excess margin, which CME holds over $200 billion, where FTX [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=136.64s)]
*  was having regulatory capital, which is absolutely nothing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  So he didn't know the difference between regulatory capital and margin capital, so it made me laugh. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=145.5s)]
*  But you know, really dismissive when it comes to a guy like that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=150.2s)]
*  So I don't know why people didn't see it, Tucker. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  You know, I mean, I said to my team, I said, you know, this is not about crypto, Tucker. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=155.48s)]
*  This is about him trying to change the world so he could list every single product under [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  the scam that he was trying to do with crypto. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=165.6s)]
*  Crypto is so small, but if he could deploy his model in the U.S. Treasury market, in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=169.56s)]
*  the U.S. agricultural market, can you imagine the damage this human being could have done [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=173.76s)]
*  to our country and the world? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=177.56s)]
*  And people literally, literally were turning a blind eye to it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=179.28s)]
*  When you look at the people that were with him, Tucker, Mark Weigand, the former head [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  of the CFTC, the chairman, he's walking around with this guy as his baggage handler and acting, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=187.4s)]
*  giving him credibility. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=194.2s)]
*  The former counsel for the CFTC became his general counsel at FTX. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  The former head of the ad committee, Mike Conaway, is his consultant working the room [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  across both sides of the aisle. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=207.16s)]
*  I mean, it's absolutely an embarrassment what went on in here, and nobody bothered to look [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=208.72s)]
*  at it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=212.28s)]
*  I said he could lose 85 percent of his value in a single day, Tucker. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=213.28s)]
*  I said that in congressional testimony. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=216.6s)]
*  I did not know how right I would be in such a short period of time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  It was a completely fraught proposal, what he was doing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=222.6s)]
*  I knew he was a fraud the day I met him, and it was quite easy to pick out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=226.04s)]
*  Well, so you assessed his character and his vibe because you met with him personally, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=230.28s)]
*  but you also assessed the fundamentals of his company as someone involved in business [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=234.08s)]
*  would. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=239.84s)]
*  Why did none of the regulators do that? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=240.84s)]
*  Where was Gary Gensler? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=241.84s)]
*  Well, I don't know where Gary Gensler was, but my regulator at the CFTC, I asked them, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=242.84s)]
*  Why in the world are you invoking the Commodity Exchange Act, Section 5, paragraph B, which [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=249.24s)]
*  says the commission will entertain innovation? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=257.08s)]
*  It also says in that same part of the act that you will protect market under surveillance [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=260.3s)]
*  and everything else to protect the consumers that are using those markets. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=264.76s)]
*  They were using that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=268.5s)]
*  I want to know, was there pressure put on the agency from politicians or not? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=269.58s)]
*  And there's hearings coming up. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=275.64s)]
*  I hope someone has the courage to take on the commissioner of the CFTC and others and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=277.28s)]
*  ask them why they were trying to put a round hole in the square peg. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=282.24s)]
*  They should have dismissed his proposal out of hand. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  Instead, I was forced to go into Congress, get berated by people that don't know what [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=287.76s)]
*  they're talking about, and I told them what could potentially happen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=291.62s)]
*  And again, it did happen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=295.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=296.76s)]
*  I just want to recommend again to our viewers, Terry Duffy is the name of our current guest. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=297.76s)]
*  And if you want a happy evening, look up his assessment of FDX. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=301.76s)]
*  It's just amazing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=306.24s)]
*  I appreciate your coming on, Terry Duffy. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=307.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=308.24s)]
*  Tucker, you're the best. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=309.24s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCQ7y2zveU&t=310.24s)]
