# Chicago is going through 'slow-motion, civilizational suicide': Dan Proft
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI)
*  So Lori Lightfoot is out as mayor of Chicago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=0.0s)]
*  We celebrated on the show several weeks ago when she lost in the primary. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  But unfortunately, in her place, Chicago voters have selected a candidate who appears to be worse. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=5.44s)]
*  Brandon Johnson is his name. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  He's an open racist like the mayor he's replacing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=11.6s)]
*  He supports defunding the police in one of the most dangerous cities on the continent. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=14.16s)]
*  Now we're learning that Brandon Johnson is also opposed to educating children. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=18.92s)]
*  Here he was in 2018 explaining that what he taught students he didn't like giving homework were bad grades. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  What it taught me though was. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=30.96s)]
*  Pushing like to eliminate sort of the standardization of our public schools. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=34.72s)]
*  My students sometimes would get frustrated. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  I didn't offer any test prep. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=41.6s)]
*  Many of my other colleagues were doing it at the time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=43.72s)]
*  I was pushing our administration to move away from that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=46.28s)]
*  To be quite frank with you, I didn't issue a lot of homework for students. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=49.64s)]
*  That was my own way of sort of rebelling against the structure. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=53.8s)]
*  I don't think I ever gave a kid an F. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=58.44s)]
*  I just I don't I don't know how a student sits in front of you and fails. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=61.96s)]
*  I know some professors may find that, you know, you know, this is slightly troubling. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=65.88s)]
*  So by not teaching the students, he was, quote, rebelling against the system. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  They actually tried this in South Africa, and you know what they got? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=76.72s)]
*  Illiteracy and then a failed state. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Dan Proft is a radio host in the city of Chicago. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=82.32s)]
*  He joins us tonight. Dan, our apologies on behalf of the rest of the country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Your great, truly great city has been taken over by someone who seems even crazier than [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=89.0s)]
*  Lori Lightfoot. Is that right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=92.8s)]
*  Well, it is right. You know, what you have going on in Chicago is slow motion [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=95.6s)]
*  civilizational suicide. And that clip from Brandon Johnson speaks to it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=99.64s)]
*  You had historian Victor Davis Hansen on your program last week, and he said, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=104.2s)]
*  the nation is going through a revolution right now and they don't even know it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=108.64s)]
*  Chicago, the corollary Chicago is going through a funeral right now, and we don't even know it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Right now in the city, fewer than a quarter of Chicago public school students can read or do math at grade level. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=117.64s)]
*  That's according to state test scores. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=124.72s)]
*  And yet that's the response from your incoming mayor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=126.88s)]
*  That's his vision for education, K through 12 education. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  This is somebody who touts himself as an educator. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=133.84s)]
*  He's a representative of the Chicago Teachers Union, which lords over education in the city. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=136.28s)]
*  Civilizational suicide. You don't teach children how to read and write. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=140.6s)]
*  You excuse the criminal element among young people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=144.52s)]
*  Major crimes are up 46 percent year over year in Chicago. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=148.44s)]
*  And Brandon Johnson's response, as you mentioned and as he touted during the campaign, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=152.72s)]
*  is to send social workers and EMTs out to respond to 911 calls that involve the possibility of violence. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  This is somebody who is openly antagonistic toward police. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  He has touted defund police as a laudable political goal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  And you have a city that has decided to throw in with him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=175.6s)]
*  Brandon Johnson, his base of support, 29 of the 50 words he won. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=180.76s)]
*  Those are the words where high where crime is the highest. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=185.56s)]
*  So where people are suffering the most from endemic violent crime, that's who carried Brandon Johnson to victory. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=188.88s)]
*  I don't know a better commentary on what the situation is in Chicago than that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=196.36s)]
*  Well, he appealed to race hate, and that's what got him elected. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=201.08s)]
*  He appealed to race hate as openly as any southern Democrat in the 1950s. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  So that's just true. Well, I appreciate it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  But what? But go ahead. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I just want to say one thing that is important, and you talk about this on your program a lot, it was a racially based election. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=214.96s)]
*  But you know who really put Brandon Johnson over the top was leftist, rich, white women. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=221.88s)]
*  I so of course, of course, that's the axis right there, Dan Profft. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=227.92s)]
*  You know how it works on happy private equity wives. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=232.72s)]
*  Yeah, met them. Great to see you tonight. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=234.84s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjEv1K8SdTI&t=236.6s)]
