# Tucker: You're being instructed not to notice this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, happy Tuesday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=6.28s)]
*  We're going to take you back about a year and a few months to the day America changed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=7.28s)]
*  You may not have noticed it at the time, but this really was the pivot point. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=12.08s)]
*  It was the height of the BLM riots early last summer, and rioters in Minneapolis had just [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=15.4s)]
*  torched a bunch of different buildings, and standing right in front of them was an MSNBC [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=20.44s)]
*  reporter who was broadcasting live from the scene. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=25.52s)]
*  Now the mob began by torching small businesses all through the city, including a liquor store, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=28.2s)]
*  which of course they looted first, naturally. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=31.88s)]
*  Then as the rioting accelerated, they walked down the street and burned down the 3rd Precinct [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=35.16s)]
*  Police Station, the Minneapolis Police Station. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=40.4s)]
*  Now as you saw that happen, you realize, ooh, this is a little different from anything we've [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  seen before. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=47.68s)]
*  We've seen riots before in 1992 following the Rodney King verdict. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=48.68s)]
*  Rioters in Los Angeles torched a lot of the middle of that city, but they didn't burn [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=52.84s)]
*  any police stations because you can't burn a police station because there are police [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=56.56s)]
*  there and they're armed and they represent the law. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=60.28s)]
*  They enforce the law. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=62.92s)]
*  So you can't burn down a police station because if they let you do that, then you know the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=63.92s)]
*  whole system is crumbled. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=66.88s)]
*  And yet that's exactly what happened just days into the BLM hysteria last summer. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=68.92s)]
*  A police station was burning. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=73.2s)]
*  And the implication of that was very clear. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=75.12s)]
*  This is why we don't allow police stations to get burned, because the message it sends [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=76.68s)]
*  is this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=79.84s)]
*  The police can't protect you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=80.84s)]
*  They can't even protect themselves. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  So the police aren't in charge. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=86.36s)]
*  Legitimate authority is gone. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=87.63999999999999s)]
*  The mob is now in charge. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  So as this is happening, there happens to be, as noted, a reporter standing right there [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=91.44s)]
*  with a microphone and a camera taking those pictures directly into your living room. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=95.52s)]
*  That reporter was called Ali Velshi. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=99.8s)]
*  Now he's famously not super bright, but he was on the scene. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  Watch how he described what was happening right behind him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  The fire engines can't get in here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=110.72s)]
*  There is no ability to bring anybody in here to solve this problem. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  So I want to be clear in how I characterize this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=115.88s)]
*  This is a mostly a protest. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=118.92s)]
*  It is not, it is not, generally speaking, unruly. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=121.92s)]
*  It's the greatest tape ever. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  You've probably seen it a hundred times. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=129.24s)]
*  We watch it every morning just for edification. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  It's mostly a protest, he said. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=133.96s)]
*  Flames in the background. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=135.32s)]
*  It's generally speaking, not unruly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=136.92s)]
*  While standing in front of a burning building. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=140.04s)]
*  So that tape, as we just said, is very famous. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=143.36s)]
*  And a lot of people look at that and they say that reporter is a moron, which of course [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  is true. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=150.96s)]
*  He couldn't even describe what he was seeing accurately. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=152.04s)]
*  What a gaffe! [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=154.96s)]
*  But it wasn't a gaffe. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=155.96s)]
*  It was not taken out of context. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  In fact, it was MSNBC's explicit editorial policy to lie about what you were watching [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=160.24s)]
*  live, to characterize violent riots as peaceful protests. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=166.88s)]
*  And it wasn't just Ali Velshi. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=170.92s)]
*  That very day, probably the oiliest of all MSNBC anchors, a character called Craig Melvin, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=173.76s)]
*  explained the network's approach to the story. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  And we're quoting, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  "'This will guide our reporting in Minnesota.' [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  While the situation on the ground in Minneapolis is fluid and there has been violence, it is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=185.76s)]
*  most accurate at this time to describe what is happening there as protests, not riots." [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=190.04s)]
*  Paging Dr. Orwell. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=196.68s)]
*  Not riots. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=200.12s)]
*  Oh, they're not riots. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=201.12s)]
*  The one thing these things aren't, when they're torching the police station, looting the liquor [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=202.12s)]
*  store, they're not riots. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, not at all. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=206.8s)]
*  But MSNBC was not an outlier in adopting this policy of reality denial. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=208.96s)]
*  Here's what CNN's coverage looked like at the time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  And let's not forget, if anyone is judging this, I'm not judging this, I'm just wondering [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=216.8s)]
*  what is going on. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  Our country was started because this is how the Boston Tea Party, rioting. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=223.08s)]
*  So do not get it twisted and think that, oh, this is something that has never happened [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  before and then this is so terrible and where are we and these savages and all of that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=238.12s)]
*  This is how this country was started. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this is totally normal. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  We've been dealing with this for hundreds of years. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=245.96s)]
*  Sam Adam himself torched a Wendy's and looted a liquor store before burning down a police [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=247.76s)]
*  station in downtown Minneapolis. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=253.28s)]
*  This is how this country started. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=254.44s)]
*  We've always had riots and looting virtually every day. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=255.88s)]
*  It's totally normal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=259.8s)]
*  So your job as a viewer per CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, The Atlantic, The Washington Post, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=260.8s)]
*  all the rest of them, was to remain calm, acknowledge that this is just the way things [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=267.64s)]
*  are, this is the way they have always been and accept it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=271.92s)]
*  The country your ancestors built is on fire, but shut up because your ancestors also burned [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=276.28s)]
*  it down. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  Now, that's not true. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=282.23999999999995s)]
*  In fact, it's grotesquely untrue. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  You have to be historically literate to believe it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  Many people are, unfortunately, but it worked because propaganda does. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=288.0s)]
*  That's why they do it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=291.76s)]
*  So instead of pushing back against this rioting, most Americans kind of went along with it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=292.96s)]
*  Well, it doesn't look quite right to me, but this is how our country started. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  That's what Don Lamont said. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=301.55999999999995s)]
*  So I'm going to kind of go along with it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=302.55999999999995s)]
*  In other words, as your quality of life declines, you are instructed not to notice. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=304.24s)]
*  This trend has continued. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=311.32s)]
*  The Washington Post just ran this headline and we're quoting, don't rant about short [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=312.92s)]
*  staff stores and supply chain woes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=317.44s)]
*  Rather than quote, living constantly in the verge of throwing a fit, we do ourselves a [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=321.28s)]
*  favor by consciously lowering expectations. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=326.78s)]
*  Got that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=330.88s)]
*  Don't like the fact that the shelves are bare in your local store. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=331.96s)]
*  Don't throw a fit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=335.92s)]
*  Don't be an entitled little tool. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=337.08s)]
*  Lower your expectations. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=340.08s)]
*  What did you expect in America? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=341.28s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=343.56s)]
*  Bread lines. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=344.56s)]
*  We've always had bread lines. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=346.2s)]
*  It's sort of charmingly retro, these bread lines. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=348.08s)]
*  Don't complain as your life becomes worse and as your country degrades. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=351.48s)]
*  That's the message. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=356.8s)]
*  And not surprisingly, that message is coming directly from the people who are making your [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=357.8s)]
*  life worse and destroying the country. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=360.44s)]
*  That would of course be the White House. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=361.84s)]
*  Here's this grouchy little flack today. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=363.88s)]
*  It's almost impossible to believe this person is real and not just some sort of mock up [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=365.88s)]
*  of like a Wesleyan gender studies student. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=371.12s)]
*  Apparently she is real. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=374.12s)]
*  And today she was asked about these supply chain problems. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=375.8s)]
*  Like our ports are shut down. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=377.8s)]
*  What do we do? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=379.44s)]
*  Watch as she mocks the reporter's question. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=381.0s)]
*  How dare you ask? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=382.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  Just a question on the timing on the supply chain issue. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=385.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  Actions that the president has taken. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  It was clear in March of 2020 when COVID hit that the supply chains across the world have [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  been disrupted. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=398.12s)]
*  Even as the sort of work to fight back against COVID proceeded, people, it was crystal clear [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  that things were not improving on supply chain. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=405.68s)]
*  People couldn't get dishwashers and furniture and treadmills delivered on time, not to mention [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=407.76000000000005s)]
*  all sorts of other things. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=414.04s)]
*  So why is it... [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=415.56s)]
*  The tragedy of the short, the treadmill that's delayed. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=416.56s)]
*  Right, the treadmills problem. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=418.72s)]
*  But the serious point is why didn't the president act sooner in a more aggressive way? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=419.72s)]
*  Were you complaining about not having a treadmill? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=427.48s)]
*  Settle down, Karen. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=430.08s)]
*  What do you want to exercise? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=431.08s)]
*  You've got Netflix and weed. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=433.12s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=434.92s)]
*  Get back to your cube. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=435.92s)]
*  Be happy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=437.0s)]
*  Lower your expectations. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=438.0s)]
*  And if you do go outside, if you notice the Walgreens is, for example, closed and so is [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=439.68s)]
*  the CVS because everything in there has been stolen by thieves who have now been redefined [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=444.24s)]
*  as civil rights protesters, stop complaining, Karen. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=449.52s)]
*  It's always been this way. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=453.16s)]
*  Now, San Francisco has very few Walgreens or CVSs or stores like that left because they've [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=454.56s)]
*  all been looted by civil rights protesters. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=460.02s)]
*  But that's not a problem, according to the mayor of San Francisco. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=463.24s)]
*  In fact, as she explains in this amazing piece of tape, it's really Walgreens fault. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=465.72s)]
*  Ultimately, you know, they've made their decision. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  We have tried to work with them in order to ensure that we are covered in terms of having [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=475.48s)]
*  pharmacies all across the city. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=481.16s)]
*  This is going to, of course, impact a lot of our neighborhoods. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=482.72s)]
*  But I wouldn't say go as far as to say they can't do business. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=485.96000000000004s)]
*  They still have a lot of stores everywhere you look. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=488.92s)]
*  Almost every corner you'll see a Walgreens and some of these stores are not just closing [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=492.28s)]
*  because of retail theft, they're closing because they're not necessarily bringing in the sales [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=496.32s)]
*  that they once did. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=500.76s)]
*  So I don't want to attribute that completely to just retail theft. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=501.84s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=505.52s)]
*  Now, so you're sort of tempted to say, well, if you elect a mayor that dumb, then you kind [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=506.52s)]
*  of deserve what you get. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=511.0s)]
*  But the truth is not everybody in San Francisco voted for London Breed, despite her alluring [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=513.28s)]
*  name. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=517.56s)]
*  They don't deserve this. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=518.56s)]
*  No one deserves this. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=519.56s)]
*  You shouldn't have daily looting in American cities because it's a first world country. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=521.28s)]
*  This isn't some third world hell hole. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=526.8s)]
*  This is once again, the country that our ancestors built. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=529.04s)]
*  It's a great country. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a clean country. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  It's an orderly country. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  People don't steal. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  You're not allowed to steal. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  Period. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=537.0799999999999s)]
*  But all of a sudden you can steal and our leaders are telling you, you've always been [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  able to steal. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=540.5999999999999s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  You bring your kids to school and oh, wait a second, there are junkies living in tents [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=543.4599999999999s)]
*  right across from your kid's school. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=547.56s)]
*  Well, they've always been there too. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  They were there when you were a kid. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=551.8s)]
*  You just never noticed. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=553.12s)]
*  Just readjust your expectations. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=554.52s)]
*  Settle down, Karen. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=556.0s)]
*  Here's Seattle's mayor, Jenny Durkin, explaining that children are just going to have to deal [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=557.92s)]
*  with the junkies living in tents right next to their school. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=561.68s)]
*  Here's a local news report from Seattle. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=565.76s)]
*  Broadview Thompson is a K-8 public school. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=568.16s)]
*  Its property includes this green belt, which was taken over by dozens of homeless that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=570.98s)]
*  neighbors say are bringing even more problems. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=575.48s)]
*  This morning in my garden, I found an empty packet that had drugs in it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=577.9s)]
*  Despite outrage from neighbors and parents whose kids are just now able to return to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=584.22s)]
*  their school, two Seattle school board members are refusing to let the encampment be cleared. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=588.22s)]
*  Mayor Jenny Durkin decided not to intervene, claiming the public school property is private [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=593.42s)]
*  property and off limits without an invitation. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so the one thing you can't do is expel the junkies, not the homeless. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=600.98s)]
*  Homeless makes it sound like some sort of protected class of protest. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=606.86s)]
*  No, they're junkies. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=609.5s)]
*  They're people shooting up, breaking into cars to support their habit, selling themselves, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=610.5s)]
*  pimping out women. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=615.38s)]
*  They're junkies, okay? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=616.38s)]
*  And they're on your kids' school lawn. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=617.5s)]
*  We can't intervene in that because it's always been that way. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=621.38s)]
*  Just lower your expectations, Karen. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=623.7s)]
*  In New York City, police have just been ordered not to intervene when they see junkies shooting [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=625.7s)]
*  up on the sidewalk or in a park. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=629.58s)]
*  Can't get in the way. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=631.62s)]
*  And you shouldn't because we've always had junkies in our park. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=632.62s)]
*  Sam Adams was actually smoking meth on the Boston Common once upon a time. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=634.9399999999999s)]
*  In Washington, D.C., the metro just basically shut down and pulled 60% of its train cars [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=639.9399999999999s)]
*  from service. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=643.86s)]
*  So commuters, the ones who pay for it, are just going to have to find another way to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=644.86s)]
*  get to work because the train service isn't working anymore. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=647.26s)]
*  Just lower your expectations. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=651.18s)]
*  In fact, they're lucky. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=652.18s)]
*  In Philadelphia last week, several people on a train, they got on the train and then [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  they got to watch as a man raped a woman on the train for minutes. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=657.54s)]
*  Witnesses describe what they saw at a Fox 29 in Philadelphia. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=663.0600000000001s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=665.86s)]
*  At Upper Darby's 69th Street Station, passengers of the Market Frankfurt Line are outraged. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=667.86s)]
*  The attack was brutal. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=674.46s)]
*  It was wicked and the worst part was when the people were watching. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=676.02s)]
*  Several people watching, some within arm's length, says Upper Darby Superintendent of [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=680.54s)]
*  Police arrested his 35-year-old Fishton Noy, who investigators say is seen on a train security [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=685.3000000000001s)]
*  camera sitting next to the alleged victim, touching her and then raping her. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=691.58s)]
*  Investigators say a female SEPTA employee called in the attack, which was relayed on [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=697.5400000000001s)]
*  radio about the attacker disrobing on a train at 56th Street Station. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=701.9000000000001s)]
*  SEPTA says Noy was arrested at 69th Street Station on the train in the act. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=708.0600000000001s)]
*  This has always been the way America works. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=716.22s)]
*  Remember Kitty Genovese? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=719.26s)]
*  She was killed and nobody said anything. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=721.14s)]
*  The difference though, we were shocked by that 55 years ago when she died. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=722.42s)]
*  In this case, passengers watched this woman get raped, but they were on their phone. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=727.74s)]
*  They were online gaming. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=732.66s)]
*  The police chief of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's transportation authority said that nobody [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=734.58s)]
*  who saw it did anything about it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=738.62s)]
*  I can tell you that people were holding their phone up in the direction of this woman being [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=742.46s)]
*  attacked. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=749.3000000000001s)]
*  And by attack, just to be totally clear, and I hate to use the word, but it's the right [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=751.46s)]
*  word, she was raped in front of all these people and they did nothing. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=755.02s)]
*  So how did this happen? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=758.5s)]
*  We're always talking about root causes. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=760.46s)]
*  What were the root causes of this rape? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=762.5s)]
*  We can tell you tonight that the 35-year-old Congolese man who apparently raped this woman, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=765.46s)]
*  whose name is Fishton Nagoy, has a criminal record and shouldn't have been here in the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=770.26s)]
*  first place. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=774.26s)]
*  He was on an overstayed student visa. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=775.26s)]
*  He should have been deported. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=776.4200000000001s)]
*  This should never have happened. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=778.1800000000001s)]
*  He should not have been here. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=779.46s)]
*  And the only reason he was is because he and a lot of people like him have been invited [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=781.0600000000001s)]
*  here and allowed to stay by the people who run the country, but who don't ride the train. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=785.0200000000001s)]
*  This particular man first came to the United States in 2012. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=789.86s)]
*  He was on a student visa. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=792.26s)]
*  Now that visa ended in 2015 because he was no longer a student. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=793.7s)]
*  Court records show that Nagoy racked up, quote, multiple arrests and two misdemeanor convictions, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=798.94s)]
*  one for controlled substances and one for sexual abuse. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=804.3s)]
*  Okay, so here's someone in the country illegally who is convicted of sexual abuse and drugs, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=808.3s)]
*  but he's still here. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=816.06s)]
*  So why aren't the people who allowed him to remain here in jail themselves? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=817.9399999999999s)]
*  They certainly should be. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=820.9799999999999s)]
*  Now this guy was put into immigration detention back in January of 2018, but he never got [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=822.4799999999999s)]
*  deported because the immigration legal system decided that he should receive a special stay [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=827.06s)]
*  of removal. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=832.04s)]
*  Oh, so he got what's called a withholding of removal from an immigration judge two years [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=833.78s)]
*  ago back in 2019. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=838.66s)]
*  According to court documents, that decision came after, quote, the Board of Immigration [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=840.74s)]
*  Appeals found the petitioner's misdemeanor sex offense was not a, quote, serious crime. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=844.8199999999999s)]
*  Just a minor sex offense. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=851.02s)]
*  And therefore he was ineligible for withholding from removal. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=853.0999999999999s)]
*  So to recap, you can walk into our country at the invitation of our leaders at public [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=859.22s)]
*  expense. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=864.02s)]
*  You can overstay your visa and in so doing mock our laws. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=865.2s)]
*  Then you can get busted for drugs and a sex crime, not deported, allowed to stay, and [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=868.4200000000001s)]
*  then you'll go on, probably inevitably at this point, to rape a woman on a train in [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=873.34s)]
*  full view of a crowd that does nothing to stop it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=879.12s)]
*  But it's always been this way. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=884.0400000000001s)]
*  Don't get uptight. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=885.52s)]
*  We adjust your expectations. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=886.6s)]
*  You want more of this? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=889.48s)]
*  We may be getting it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=890.48s)]
*  Today, Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Border Patrol, a guy called Chris Magnus, sat for [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=891.48s)]
*  his confirmation hearings. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=895.1999999999999s)]
*  Now it turns out that Magnus, if anything, is to the left of Biden, even to the left [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=897.24s)]
*  of Barack Obama on immigration matters. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=903.16s)]
*  Just a year ago when he was the police chief of Tucson, Arizona, Magnus rejected a federal [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=905.8s)]
*  grant that was part of a program called Operation Stone Garden that was supported by the Obama [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=909.88s)]
*  administration. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=913.88s)]
*  Now the point of the program was to help border towns fight cartel violence and drug trafficking. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=915.04s)]
*  That would seem a worthy goal, not really directly related to immigration, directly [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  related to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=925.88s)]
*  But Chris Magnus, in his wisdom, rejected that money. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=929.62s)]
*  His own police department was outraged by this, but Chris Magnus didn't care because [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=933.28s)]
*  he's a deeply good person, unlike you. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=937.0s)]
*  He's happy to abet the deaths of thousands of Americans by drug ODs. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=939.08s)]
*  He said that this money and this mission, stopping drug cartels, didn't align with [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=943.88s)]
*  the work he's doing. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=948.12s)]
*  That work, of course, is opening our country's borders. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=950.28s)]
*  So here you have the person who's about to oversee our country's border security, who [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=953.16s)]
*  does not believe in borders. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=958.04s)]
*  Now if that bothers you in any way, if you think we should be deporting rapists instead [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=961.32s)]
*  of letting them rape women on trains, then the White House has a very clear message for [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=964.84s)]
*  you. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=969.92s)]
*  Shut up, Karen. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=970.92s)]
*  Stop complaining. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=971.92s)]
*  Because arsonists aren't arsonists, they're mostly peaceful protesters. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=972.9599999999999s)]
*  That treadmill? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=975.8s)]
*  You don't deserve a treadmill. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=976.8s)]
*  Lower your expectations. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=979.0799999999999s)]
*  Get used to it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowIQEYfqEE&t=981.1999999999999s)]
