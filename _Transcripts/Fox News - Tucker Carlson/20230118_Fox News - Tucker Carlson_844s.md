# Tucker Carlson: Nobody talks about this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, Sheila Jackson Lee is famous in Washington [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=2.08s)]
*  for being the single most obnoxious member of Congress. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=5.32s)]
*  Now that's a title that as you can imagine [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=9.24s)]
*  has many contenders, but Sheila Jackson Lee stands alone. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=10.88s)]
*  Don't you know who I am? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=15.4s)]
*  She once screamed at a flight attendant [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=17.06s)]
*  in the first class cabin on a continental flight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=18.68s)]
*  I am Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=20.84s)]
*  Where is my seafood meal? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=23.48s)]
*  In the 1990s, during a visit to NASA, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=26.5s)]
*  Sheila Jackson Lee demanded to see the flag [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  that astronauts had planted on Mars. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=31.72s)]
*  When gently informed that no human being [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=35.04s)]
*  has ever been to Mars because it's very far away, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=36.68s)]
*  Lee flew into a rage. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=40.16s)]
*  She accused NASA of racism and pointed out her membership [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=41.72s)]
*  on the quote science committee in Congress and so on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=45.2s)]
*  We could spend the entire hour [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=48.42s)]
*  on Sheila Jackson Lee's stories and it's tempting. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  On Capitol Hill, she's known as the queen [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=52.4s)]
*  and not in a good way. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=54.96s)]
*  But what's interesting is that nobody ever talks [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=56.76s)]
*  about the congressional district [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=59.12s)]
*  that Sheila Jackson Lee supposedly represents. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=60.68s)]
*  It's mostly inner city Houston and it could use some help. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=63.94s)]
*  Lee's district has a poverty rate [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=67.28s)]
*  almost twice the national average [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=68.84s)]
*  to all the usual markers of civilizational decline. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=70.44s)]
*  High crime, bad schools, low social cohesion, drugs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=73.4s)]
*  Now Lee has quote served in Congress for nearly 30 years, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=78.96s)]
*  but it's hard to think of a single thing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=83.52s)]
*  she has ever done to improve the lives [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=85.52s)]
*  of the people who elected her. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=87.84s)]
*  She doesn't seem interested. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=89.2s)]
*  Instead, Sheila Jackson Lee has devoted [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  her entire political career, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=93.8s)]
*  indeed her entire life to a single cause, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=95.28s)]
*  shrieking about white racism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  That's what Sheila Jackson Lee does for a living. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=100.84s)]
*  Here's a selection. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Institutional racism and systemic racism taints and spoils [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=104.84s)]
*  the way that America treats in one instance, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  African-Americans and other instances, minorities. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=113.36s)]
*  The dastardly impacts of white nationalism, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=116.04s)]
*  white supremacy and outright racism. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  Racism is a national security threat. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  Racism is a national security threat. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=124.36000000000001s)]
*  Racism is a national security threat. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=126.84s)]
*  Institutional racism does exist [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=128.76000000000002s)]
*  and until we accept that, we will not finish our job. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  We will not elect a chief bigot [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=133.8s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=137.08s)]
*  Our system is such that it then allows Americans, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=138.76s)]
*  people to act in instances in a racist manner. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=144.28s)]
*  Racism, you see, is a national security threat. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  It's a national security threat. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  Really, Sheila Jackson Lee, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  tell us how racism is a national security threat. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  Speak slowly, we've got plenty of time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=160.56s)]
*  But of course she won't do that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=163.16s)]
*  She's got no argument, she's got no facts. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=164.44s)]
*  She doesn't even have a sincere belief in what she's saying. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=166.84s)]
*  It's absurd and she knows it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=170.56s)]
*  And by the way, Sheila Jackson Lee doesn't wanna protect [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=173.32s)]
*  a country she despises from national security threats. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=175.2s)]
*  Why would she wanna do that? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=178.48s)]
*  No, that's not the point. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=179.6s)]
*  What she's doing here every day is leveling a racial attack, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=180.8s)]
*  a blood libel against an entire group of Americans [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=185.48s)]
*  while simultaneously pretending to be the victim of attacks [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=188.72s)]
*  from that same group. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=191.68s)]
*  Stop hitting me, she howls as she punches you in the face. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=193.56s)]
*  It's such a common tactic at this point, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=198.04s)]
*  and it's been used constantly by Al Sharpton, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  by the ADL, by so many others. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  That you may not even notice it anymore, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=205.32s)]
*  but it's still disgusting, it's still immoral, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=207.44s)]
*  it's still divisive. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=209.2s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden doing it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  And finally, we're confronting the stains [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=212.64s)]
*  of what remains the deep stain on the soul of the nation, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=215.92s)]
*  hate and white supremacy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  You know, there's a tough through line of subjugation [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=222.64s)]
*  and of slave people from our earliest days [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  to the reigns of radicalized terror, the KKK, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=229.8s)]
*  to Dr. King being assassinated, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=232.68s)]
*  and the violent, deadly insurrection [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=234.84s)]
*  on the Capitol nine months ago. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  It was about white supremacy in my view. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=238.44s)]
*  Speaking of blood libel, because that's what it is, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=242.44s)]
*  protesting the 2020 election results is the same as slavery. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  As the KKK, it's the same as murdering Martin Luther King. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=249.96s)]
*  It's all white supremacy declares Joe Biden [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=252.56s)]
*  without defining the term. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  Now you may recall when Joe Biden said that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=257.36s)]
*  You probably dismissed it at the time as ridiculous [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=259.64s)]
*  as the rantings of a senile partisan, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=262.08s)]
*  and of course, that's what it was. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  But you should also keep in mind [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=265.84s)]
*  that Joe Biden did not say that by accident. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=267.68s)]
*  It wasn't an ad lib, off the cuff. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=269.91999999999996s)]
*  No, his staff signed off on that speech. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=272.76s)]
*  They wrote it, they read it before he read it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=274.88s)]
*  And they wrote it for a reason. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=277.68s)]
*  When the president of the United States [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=279.68s)]
*  identifies a threat to this country, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  his many federal agencies, the biggest in the world, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=283.76s)]
*  swing into action to neutralize that threat. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=286.64s)]
*  That's how the system works, as Joe Biden's staff well knows. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=289.68s)]
*  So in fact, when Joe Biden likens you to Al Qaeda or the Klan, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=294.08s)]
*  it's not a small thing at all. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=299.56s)]
*  It has implications. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=300.88s)]
*  So here's Sheila Jackson Lee from last week [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  in a not unrelated clip, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=305.32s)]
*  calling for the renewal of the Patriot Act. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=307.8s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=310.44s)]
*  I remember after 9-11 when we all worked together [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=311.64s)]
*  to ensure the protection of the American people [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=315.4s)]
*  through the Patriot Act and dealing with the FISA courts. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=318.88s)]
*  We worked together. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=323.12s)]
*  Because truth is important. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=324.67999999999995s)]
*  That's kind of strange if you think about it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=328.28s)]
*  So why would Sheila Jackson Lee, a self-described liberal, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=330.0s)]
*  find herself last week praising the secret government courts [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=334.64s)]
*  that liberals once opposed passionately [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=338.56s)]
*  on the grounds that those courts could be used [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=341.52s)]
*  to destroy the constitutional rights of Americans [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=343.4s)]
*  without anyone knowing about it? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Secret courts? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  Liberals were against secret courts. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=349.56s)]
*  And now the chief liberal in Congress [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  is strongly for secret courts. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=353.4s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, because those secret courts [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  turn out to be a highly effective way [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  to silence the critics of the Democratic Party, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=361.56s)]
*  to silence those so-called white supremacists [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  Joe Biden's always yelling about, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=365.56s)]
*  not all of whom, by the way, are white. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  You don't have to be white to be a white supremacist. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  You just have to oppose the agenda. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=371.2s)]
*  And of course, Sheila Jackson Lee knows that very well. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  And that's why she wants to renew the Patriot Act indefinitely. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=375.4s)]
*  And there are enough dumb Republicans [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  that she may be able to. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=381.44s)]
*  But Sheila Jackson Lee would like to go [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=383.12s)]
*  a lot further than that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=384.48s)]
*  Lee has just introduced a bill called [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=386.08s)]
*  the Leading Against White Supremacy Act of 2023. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  Now, it's not an exaggeration to say this single bill [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=392.56s)]
*  would do more to criminalize speech, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=395.68s)]
*  previously constitutionally guaranteed speech, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=399.32s)]
*  than any other piece of legislation [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=401.8s)]
*  that has been proposed in the entire history of this country. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  That's not an overstatement at all. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=407.8s)]
*  And to prove it, we're gonna read directly from the bill. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=409.12s)]
*  Here it is, quote, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=411.36s)]
*  "'A conspiracy to engage in white supremacy [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  inspired hate crime shall be determined to exist [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=415.64s)]
*  between two or more persons, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=418.64s)]
*  at least one of whom published material [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=420.2s)]
*  advancing white supremacy, white supremacist ideology, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=422.56s)]
*  antagonism based on, quote, replacement theory, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=426.68s)]
*  or hate speech that vilifies or is otherwise directed [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=429.44s)]
*  against any non-white person or group, end quote. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=432.48s)]
*  Now, nowhere in the legislation is the term white supremacy [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=436.32000000000005s)]
*  or white supremacist ideology ever defined. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=441.24s)]
*  Of course, it's never defined. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=445.68s)]
*  It's left open. It's subjective. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  Anything can be white supremacy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  But the bill does specifically point [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=452.6s)]
*  to something called replacement theory, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=457.0s)]
*  white supremacist ideology. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=460.64s)]
*  If you engage in either one of them, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=462.24s)]
*  you go to federal prison, possibly for a very long time. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=464.4s)]
*  So all that's required under this piece of legislation, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=468.52s)]
*  which has not been laughed out of Congress yet, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=470.92s)]
*  all that's required is that your political opinions, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=472.76s)]
*  quote, could, as determined by a reasonable person, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=474.96s)]
*  motivate actions by a person predisposed [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  to engaging in a white supremacy inspired hate crime. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=482.04s)]
*  So what would qualify as a felony under this law? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=486.6s)]
*  Well, virtually everything, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=489.36s)]
*  but among them would be pointing out [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=491.64000000000004s)]
*  the Democratic Party politicians, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=494.04s)]
*  including Chuck Schumer, the leading Senate Democrat, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  have longed to brag that they are flooding this country [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=497.92s)]
*  with immigrants in order to change the demography [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=500.32000000000005s)]
*  to maintain political power for themselves. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=503.24s)]
*  They've said that many times. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=505.36s)]
*  They've written it, they've bragged about it on camera, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=506.76s)]
*  but if you notice it under this bill, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=509.76s)]
*  you would be criminally responsible [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=512.2s)]
*  for the violent acts of people you have never met, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=513.92s)]
*  and you would go to jail for terrorism. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=517.16s)]
*  Now, what's most interesting about this bill [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=521.52s)]
*  is that it's race specific. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=525.4s)]
*  Nothing in Sheila Jackson Lee's legislation [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=527.8s)]
*  would apply to say black supremacy [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=530.12s)]
*  or murder sprees by people who aren't white supremacists, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  the massacre in Waukesha, for example. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  So that means that Democratic Party politicians [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=540.12s)]
*  can continue to say whatever they want with impunity. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=543.0s)]
*  The First Amendment still applies to them, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  but not to anyone who doesn't vote for them. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=548.36s)]
*  So that's the definition of tyranny. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  It's horrifying, it's a direct attack on the Bill of Rights, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=552.88s)]
*  on our core freedoms guaranteed by the US government [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  for 250 years. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=559.56s)]
*  We shouldn't be surprised by this, however, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=561.52s)]
*  because it's consistent with what Biden has promised, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=563.12s)]
*  has promised since the day he got into office. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=565.48s)]
*  And the promise was that race blind justice, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=567.6s)]
*  which is the entire foundation of the rule of law [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=570.16s)]
*  in the West has been for centuries, is done. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  The new model, South Africa. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=576.2s)]
*  That's the new model, South Africa, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=578.24s)]
*  a country we never talk about [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  because no one wants to admit what's happened there [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=581.08s)]
*  over the past 29 years. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=583.76s)]
*  But on the basis of that, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  Biden tried to allocate farm aid on the basis of skin color. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=587.24s)]
*  The federal judge blocked that plan, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=591.04s)]
*  but it has not stopped the Democratic Party [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=592.8399999999999s)]
*  because no one's repudiated the idea. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=595.68s)]
*  No one on the right has been brave enough to say, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=597.64s)]
*  no, the federal government can never award or punish [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=599.4s)]
*  on the basis of skin color. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=604.52s)]
*  That is immoral and it's contrary to American law. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=605.5999999999999s)]
*  And because no one has said that, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=608.56s)]
*  Democrats, including Sheila Jackson Lee, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=610.28s)]
*  have decided that their opponents are terrorists [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  and they're terrorists because of their race. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=616.04s)]
*  And once you're a terrorist, what do we get to do? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=619.4000000000001s)]
*  We can take all your stuff. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=621.1600000000001s)]
*  We get to seize your assets. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=622.72s)]
*  It shouldn't surprise you that is actually unfolding [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=625.0s)]
*  in the state of California. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  Always the leading edge of lunacy. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=630.96s)]
*  These economists have worked alongside us [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=632.2800000000001s)]
*  over this past year to come up with potential estimates [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=634.6400000000001s)]
*  for what reparations in the form of compensation [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=638.2800000000001s)]
*  or cash payments can look like for African-Americans. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  That $500 billion number represents the state [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=645.0s)]
*  of California's maximum culpability [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=649.72s)]
*  for racist redlining practices. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=652.32s)]
*  And that number represents the state [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=654.56s)]
*  of California's maximum liability. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=656.28s)]
*  It is not a final recommendation coming [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=658.48s)]
*  out of the task force. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=660.44s)]
*  Final recommendations do not come out [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=661.76s)]
*  until July 1 of 2023. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=663.44s)]
*  Now, everything about this, of course, is bad and wrong, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=667.84s)]
*  not just in practice, but in principle. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=671.12s)]
*  But in practice, it sets up an incentive [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=673.88s)]
*  that the whole country is gonna have to grapple [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=675.96s)]
*  with fairly soon. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=677.28s)]
*  We've already been told that you can change your sex, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=678.12s)]
*  your immutable characteristic, just by wishing it so. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=680.4s)]
*  Men can become women, women can become men. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=682.56s)]
*  Why then can't people change their race? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=685.24s)]
*  That's a sincere question that is waived away as ridiculous, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=687.76s)]
*  but it's not any more ridiculous than changing your sex. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=691.4s)]
*  In fact, it's the same. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=694.56s)]
*  So under laws like this, there is a huge incentive [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=696.72s)]
*  to change your race because you get paid for doing that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=699.64s)]
*  What are we gonna do about that? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=702.24s)]
*  But what's interesting and sadly, sadly predictable [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=704.88s)]
*  is that as politicians in California [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=709.4s)]
*  and the rest of the country decide how they're gonna loot [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=711.92s)]
*  the treasury in the name of racial justice, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=714.16s)]
*  the communities they supposedly serve are falling apart [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=716.12s)]
*  in real, tangible, measurable ways. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=718.84s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=721.32s)]
*  Axios, for example, reports that carjackings [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=722.72s)]
*  in DC have risen for the fifth straight year. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=725.08s)]
*  Ask anyone who lives there. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=728.72s)]
*  Ask the DC council candidate who was carjacked [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=730.9200000000001s)]
*  in broad daylight a year ago. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=735.04s)]
*  A vehicle stolen Friday may be linked [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  to multiple crimes in Northeast, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=739.84s)]
*  including the murder of 19-year-old Devin Brewer. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=741.96s)]
*  There was a drive-by shooting on Central Avenue Northeast. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=744.76s)]
*  Both victims survived. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=747.96s)]
*  A lookout for the same Highlander [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  went out over police radio. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  The plates on the car appear to match [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=753.04s)]
*  the Burgundy Highlander used to carjack [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=755.16s)]
*  a DC council candidate at gunpoint. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=757.44s)]
*  Nate Fleming was at a gas station [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=759.56s)]
*  on Nanny Helen Burroughs Avenue Northeast. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=761.2399999999999s)]
*  He says when the suspect pulled a gun, he gave up the keys, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=763.4799999999999s)]
*  then went into the convenience store to call 911. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=766.88s)]
*  He says one of the guys came in to stop him from doing that, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=770.0799999999999s)]
*  chasing him out of the store. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=773.28s)]
*  So instead of doing anything about that in DC, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=776.64s)]
*  the leaders are doing what Sheila Jackson Lee does, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=780.88s)]
*  shrieking about white racism, as if that's the problem [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=783.28s)]
*  or even a related problem. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=786.0s)]
*  Of course, it has nothing to do with carjackings. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=787.24s)]
*  As for actual carjackings that are killing people, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=789.96s)]
*  making taxpayers leave DC, terrifying everyone in the city, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=793.1600000000001s)]
*  well, the DC city council has just passed a bill [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=798.12s)]
*  that will lighten the punishment for carjacking [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=801.1600000000001s)]
*  as well as other violent crimes. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=804.6800000000001s)]
*  So here's what you have. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=806.88s)]
*  At the same time that Sheila Jackson Lee [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=808.0s)]
*  would like to make it a quote, hate crime, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=811.5200000000001s)]
*  a felony for disagreeing with her, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=813.4000000000001s)]
*  her compatriots in DC and across the country [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=817.96s)]
*  are making it easier for you to get killed [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=823.2800000000001s)]
*  by an actual carjacker. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=826.4000000000001s)]
*  Anarcho-Tyranny is the name of that system [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  and it's spreading because no one's saying anything about it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86N4eXeIMUY&t=831.2s)]
