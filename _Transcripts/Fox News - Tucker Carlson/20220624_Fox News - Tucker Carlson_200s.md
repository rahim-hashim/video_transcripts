# WaPo Finance columnist on inflation: 'You've got to stop complaining'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84)
*  since people who live in the country can't afford to drive their cars or buy groceries. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=0.0s)]
*  But no one in Washington seems concerned about this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  The economy is fine as far as they're concerned. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  In fact, Democrats say it's a perfect time to splurge. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=10.24s)]
*  For real. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=13.96s)]
*  Our own Bill Mollugin is tracking this story for us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=14.96s)]
*  Hey Bill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Hey Tucker, that's right. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  So there is an assortment of media figures and politicians alike who seem to be telling [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=19.56s)]
*  Americans just don't believe your lying eyes when it comes to the prospect of a recession. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=24.16s)]
*  And the chairman of the Federal Reserve certainly doesn't seem too worried as he was literally [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=28.96s)]
*  whistling around Washington today as Fox's Hillary Vaughn was trying to question him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=33.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=38.88s)]
*  Chairman Powell, should the president stop calling it Putin's price hike? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=39.88s)]
*  You told lawmakers yesterday that inflation started well before the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=42.88s)]
*  So should he stop saying it's Putin's price hike? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=48.08s)]
*  And on top of that, Washington Post finance columnist Michelle Singletary demanded that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=54.44s)]
*  Americans who are doing well just everybody calm down and back off when it comes to inflation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=58.9s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=64.7s)]
*  You gotta stop complaining when there's so many people who literally the inflation rate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=65.7s)]
*  means they may only have two meals instead of three. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=71.0s)]
*  There are Americans who did extremely well in the last two years in the market. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=73.64s)]
*  You still have your job. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=78.84s)]
*  And yeah, it's costing you more for gas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=80.56s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=82.52s)]
*  If you're going to take that holiday, that Fourth of July vacation, you can still eat out. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  So I'm going to need you to calm down and back off. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=87.2s)]
*  But overall, many Americans are not suffering as much as they think they are. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=90.0s)]
*  And not to be outdone, MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhl said it's the media's fault for talking the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=95.32s)]
*  U.S. into a possible recession. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=100.84s)]
*  Another thing the Fed can't do, though, is control media hype or political agendas. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=104.08s)]
*  In some ways, we're talking ourselves into an inflation frenzy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=108.84s)]
*  When you talk about it every minute of every day, then every possible business out there [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  raise their prices. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=116.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=117.72s)]
*  Because they can. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=118.72s)]
*  Because no one's going to argue, why are you raising that price? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=119.72s)]
*  Inflation, inflation, inflation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=122.28s)]
*  And if you can't afford your gas or your groceries, there's no need to worry. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Ed Perlmutter says you can just get a Peloton for much cheaper [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=129.12s)]
*  now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=133.6s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=134.6s)]
*  I think all of us would agree we don't want to see inflation, but we went through a pandemic [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=135.6s)]
*  and we've had shortages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=139.72s)]
*  So you could go get a Peloton today at half the price you would have paid a year ago, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=141.48s)]
*  Mr. Stile. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=146.76s)]
*  You can't eat a Peloton. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=147.76s)]
*  You can't eat a Peloton. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=150.76s)]
*  And Tucker, on top of all of that, the LA Times wrote an article saying a recession looks [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  inevitable but it might not be that bad. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=156.88s)]
*  There was an opinion piece in Bloomberg that said inflation is just a lesson in appreciating [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  what you had instead of complaining about losing what you had. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=165.0s)]
*  And the New York Times wrote a piece saying a bad economy might end up actually being [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=169.32s)]
*  a good thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  You'll owe nothing and you'll like it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=177.4s)]
*  Eat your bugs. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=178.72s)]
*  Half price Pelotons. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=179.72s)]
*  I assume all that's real, Bill Mollugin. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=180.72s)]
*  We trust you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ia6pzYD84&t=186.07999999999998s)]
