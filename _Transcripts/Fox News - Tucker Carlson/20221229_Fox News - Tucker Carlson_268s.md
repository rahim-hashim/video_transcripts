# 'Mayor Pete' decided to ignore a crisis: Sean Duffy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8)
*  Total nightmare. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=0.0s)]
*  There's only one person happy about the airport mess [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=1.0s)]
*  and the massive pileups of luggage at all these airports, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=3.36s)]
*  and that's Sam Britton. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=6.44s)]
*  And the truth is, everything about this crisis was foreseeable. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=8.08s)]
*  In August, 38 state attorneys general [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=11.68s)]
*  wrote to Congress to report that Pete Buttigieg was ignoring [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=13.88s)]
*  consumer complaints in the airline industry. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=17.44s)]
*  Unfortunately, the agency has thus far failed to respond. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=19.72s)]
*  The attorney generals wrote. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=24.2s)]
*  They were so outraged that they called on Congress [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=25.96s)]
*  to strip the Department of Transportation [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=28.48s)]
*  of the ability to oversee customer complaints [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=30.68s)]
*  against the airlines and awarded it to the states themselves. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=33.12s)]
*  That's not hard to see why those attorneys generals [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=37.84s)]
*  were so furious. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=40.24s)]
*  Without reliable air travel, the economy collapses. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=41.64s)]
*  And Mayor Pete was ignoring the problem. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=45.08s)]
*  He was able to do that because despite his fixation [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=47.0s)]
*  on climate change, Buttigieg flies everywhere on private jet. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=49.92s)]
*  What's striking is how often this happens. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=54.0s)]
*  There's a crisis, and Pete Buttigieg decides to ignore it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=56.96s)]
*  Mayor Pete went on vacation in Portugal just a couple of weeks [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=60.28s)]
*  ago as rail workers prepared to strike. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=63.52s)]
*  He was on paternity leave as dozens of container ships [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=66.12s)]
*  couldn't enter the country a year ago. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=69.44s)]
*  And Mayor Pete hasn't even mentioned this horrifying story [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=71.6s)]
*  of a woman freezing to death in her car [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=74.84s)]
*  just before Christmas while driving home from work. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=77.16s)]
*  Buttigieg loves to talk about racist roads, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=79.88s)]
*  but he hasn't mentioned this tragedy at all. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=82.44s)]
*  Here's an NBC report. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=84.76s)]
*  People walking the streets with sidewalks submerged [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=87.12s)]
*  days after the deadliest storm in the city's history. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=90.0s)]
*  Now more than 30 dead in Western New York. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=93.44s)]
*  Among them, Andell Taylor, her sister say. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  She was one of the best sisters, daughters, friends, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=99.28s)]
*  aunts you could ever have. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=104.0s)]
*  Taylor's sister say she pulled over on her drive home [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  from work Friday with the storm bearing down. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  They say Taylor took these videos in her final hours, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=112.16s)]
*  calling 911 for help that didn't make it in time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  A resident finding her dead the day before Christmas. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=118.16s)]
*  As Andell Taylor was sitting in her car for hours, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=121.84s)]
*  she texted with family members about the long wait for help. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=124.44s)]
*  Taylor's sister couldn't believe New York officials [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  were so caught off guard by the blizzard. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=129.72s)]
*  She texted, quote, unsurprised in a state known for it, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=132.04s)]
*  or unprepared in a state known for it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=136.0s)]
*  More than 35 people died during the Buffalo blizzard. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=138.0s)]
*  Many of them had been stranded like Andell Taylor [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=140.64s)]
*  without any assistance from first responders. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=143.72s)]
*  This is a massive failure of state and federal leadership. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=146.44s)]
*  But instead of acknowledging that, Pete Buttigieg, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=149.88s)]
*  he's ignoring it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=152.32s)]
*  For her part, New York's governor Kathy Hochul [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=153.6s)]
*  is blaming, you guessed it, climate change. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  She says it's making the weather far more dangerous. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  But the truth is that the number of people dying [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=162.44s)]
*  from natural disasters, particularly [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  storms and extreme temperatures, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  is plummeted in the last century. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  That's because competent leadership responds [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=170.92s)]
*  to these disasters and minimizes the loss of life [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=174.44s)]
*  and human suffering. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=177.6s)]
*  But incompetent leaders, leaders like Joe Biden, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=179.12s)]
*  they vacation in the Virgin Islands and ignore disasters. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=182.04s)]
*  That's why the Texas border now looks like this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=185.28s)]
*  Today, Fox cameras capturing hundreds of migrants [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=189.56s)]
*  in four separate groups crossing into the US [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=192.76s)]
*  at the southern border in Eagle Pass, Texas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=195.76s)]
*  Hundreds of miles to the northwest in El Paso, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=198.96s)]
*  a wire fence rapidly erected and hundreds [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=201.76s)]
*  of military personnel are in place to prepare [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=204.04s)]
*  for a potentially explosive surge of migrants. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=206.72s)]
*  Also in El Paso, this massive tent, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=210.0s)]
*  larger than a football field set up by US customs [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=212.32s)]
*  and border protection, will act as a processing center [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=215.16s)]
*  if there is a surge. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=218.12s)]
*  With freezing temperatures, shelters there are full. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=220.44s)]
*  Migrants have been sleeping on the streets [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=223.24s)]
*  with donated blankets. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=225.08s)]
*  Weeks ago, before he went on vacation, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=227.28s)]
*  Joe Biden was asked why he doesn't visit [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  the southern border. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  There's more important things going on, Biden said. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=231.96s)]
*  Now, as expected, hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  are flooding the border into a country [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  that's already becoming more third world-like every day. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  People are freezing to death in their cars [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=243.4s)]
*  and air travel isn't even close to reliable. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=245.96s)]
*  You have to ask, if this administration wanted [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  to overwhelm and sabotage what's left [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=251.0s)]
*  of the country's infrastructure, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=253.52s)]
*  what exactly would they do differently? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3AfkFiw8&t=255.44s)]
