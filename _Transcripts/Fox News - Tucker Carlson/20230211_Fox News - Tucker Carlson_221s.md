# Tucker: The FBI has joined the hunt for Christians
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s)
*  In this weird inverted world that we're living in, the criminals are actually the victims. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=0.0s)]
*  Who are the criminals? Well, obviously, sincere Christians. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=4.16s)]
*  They're the real problems. The sincere Christians in the middle class, boy, they're dangerous. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=7.36s)]
*  And the FBI, it's hard to believe this, doubtless they're decent FBI agents, but the FBI as an [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=11.6s)]
*  organization has joined in the hunt for Christians, and we have proof of it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=16.96s)]
*  The FBI tried to manufacture crimes against sincere Catholics. The FBI's Richmond field [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=21.76s)]
*  office recently published an internal document promising to punish, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=26.56s)]
*  radical traditionalist Catholics and their ideology. Now, just to make something completely clear, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=30.56s)]
*  the Bill of Rights prohibits the government from weighing in on sectarian or religious questions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=36.4s)]
*  They don't get to decide whether your religion is good or bad. They have to be agnostic on it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=43.2s)]
*  But the FBI has decided if you're too sincere about Catholicism, you're a criminal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=49.76s)]
*  The document cites obvious lies from the fascist and dishonest Southern Poverty Law Center several [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=54.72s)]
*  times. Now, we only have this memo because a recently suspended FBI agent called Kyle Seraphin [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  brought it to the public, and we're grateful that he did. Kyle, thank you so much for joining us [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=67.44s)]
*  tonight. This, it's hard to believe this is even real. This is one of those, what was your reaction [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=71.44s)]
*  when you saw this? Well, my reaction is predictable. I mean, I'm a Catholic, number one, and I think [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=76.08s)]
*  it's appalling. It's one of those things that when the government has gotten to the point where you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=82.08s)]
*  talked about our Second Amendment rights and those defend our First Amendment rights to practice our [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=86.88s)]
*  religion, particularly the way that we want to. I'm friends with people who love the Latin Mass. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=90.8s)]
*  I grew up in a traditional school where I actually learned Latin in fifth and sixth grade and all the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=95.2s)]
*  way through high school. And it doesn't seem reasonable, but it is the state of the FBI at [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=99.2s)]
*  this point that they are so desperate to find white supremacists that they're going to look [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=105.44s)]
*  at the Catholic Church. But I think if we're realistic about it, what they're doing is they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=108.72s)]
*  have found a gateway in what they think is fringe Catholicism in order to move into Christians in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=112.72s)]
*  general and declare them to be the actual, the criminals in this country or the potential terrorists. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=120.08s)]
*  And that's what I think we're seeing because this, the whole document basically is written from the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=125.52s)]
*  perspective of somebody who thinks that there are significant abortion rights that need to be [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=130.0s)]
*  defended and also an LGBTQ agenda that has to be pushed down the American people's throats. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=133.52s)]
*  And those are antithetical to Catholicism. So it's pretty easy. It's an open door [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  into Christians in this country, which is pretty much all the country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=144.88s)]
*  Well, yeah. And also Orthodox Judaism and Islam and Mormonism. I mean, they're right. And I did [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=148.8s)]
*  know in the FBI say, whoa, wait a second. It's not our job to decide which is a better religion and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=154.96s)]
*  criminalize people's religious belief. Did anyone in your world within the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  Bureau say that? Well, obviously the whistleblower who brought it to me. So I'm in contact with a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=165.28s)]
*  number of people who work in the FBI and have the same values that probably you and I do. And so, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  you know, they, they brought it to me. One of them brought it to me and said, this is a problem. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=175.12s)]
*  And this person is not a Catholic. But he or she stated the very simple statement, which is that if [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=178.88s)]
*  they're going to go after radical traditional Catholics, then radical traditional Baptists are [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=183.36s)]
*  next and radical traditional evangelicals and anybody else that espouses essentially what is [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=187.84s)]
*  radical, which is just a Christian faith. And that is dangerous, apparently in this country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=193.36s)]
*  I'm not Catholic either. I'd be defending the Scientologist or anybody else. Like you can't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=198.72s)]
*  do this. So I appreciate you bringing this to the public. Kyle Scherfen, thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=202.72s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=209.52s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkbKKtBF5s&t=217.84s)]
