# Tucker: Should pedophiles be chemically castrated?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0)
*  Democrats 30 years ago would be shocked at what has happened to their party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=0.0s)]
*  If they could fast forward decades, they wouldn't recognize it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=4.2s)]
*  All of a sudden, the party as a party is aggressively sexualizing children, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=6.84s)]
*  not just drag queen story hours, not just the mutilation of children, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=11.88s)]
*  sexual mutilation, the name of gender ideology, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=15.8s)]
*  but pushing graphic sexualization in schools on little kids. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=18.28s)]
*  And at the same time, many of our leaders are refusing to punish pedophiles. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=23.28s)]
*  So Stephanie Lord is a state representative in New Mexico [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=28.6s)]
*  and has noticed this, and she's trying to get a couple of bills passed [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=30.64s)]
*  that punish child sex abusers, and they've been rejected by Democrats. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  So now she has a new idea. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Her idea is chemical castration isn't just for kids. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=39.56s)]
*  How about doing it to pedophiles, too? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Stephanie Lord is a New Mexico state representative. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=47.32s)]
*  Stephanie, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=48.24s)]
*  So rather than have us characterize your idea, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  if you wouldn't mind explaining what it is. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=53.36s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=56.96s)]
*  It's an honor to be on your show, and I'm very grateful to be here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=57.52s)]
*  And I'm glad you're giving me this opportunity to talk about this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=59.96s)]
*  So I want to make something really clear in New Mexico. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  The majority of people in our state are moderate Democrats. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=65.88s)]
*  But unfortunately, we've got some progressive Democrats [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=69.48s)]
*  that are pushing forward some radical ideology. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=72.0s)]
*  So my first session when I was up here, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=75.0s)]
*  there was quite a few bills to be soft on criminals, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=77.92s)]
*  let criminals out, give them special things that they wouldn't normally have. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=80.4s)]
*  So I kept presenting amendments that said, OK, well, you want to let the criminals out early. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=85.2s)]
*  How about not pedophiles? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=90.52s)]
*  How about we don't be nice and don't give them special treatment? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=92.08s)]
*  Yeah. How about that? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=95.88s)]
*  And so I even presented an amendment about let's not let them cut children's hair [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=98.0s)]
*  because that idea actually discussed me to have them put their hands on children. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=101.84s)]
*  And every amendment I presented was shot down literally. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=106.6s)]
*  So it really got me thinking. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=110.72s)]
*  So what can I do? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  What is something that I can do in this next session when I got reelected? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=113.72000000000001s)]
*  What can I do? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=117.12s)]
*  And I happen to see this bill in Tennessee that was based off the Alabama bill on chemical castration. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=118.28s)]
*  I looked at it. I thought, this is a great idea. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=124.56s)]
*  This is a way to a tool that we can use to keep these pedophiles away from our children. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  That's all that I wanted. That's all I ever wanted out of this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  So have you considered calling it puberty blockers? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  If you did that, maybe every Democrat in New Mexico would vote for it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=141.44s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=147.12s)]
*  Well, that is what's frustrating. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=148.6s)]
*  It's the few progressives that we have because we have some actually really good Democrats. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=150.44s)]
*  But the progressive ideology has taken over. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=156.2s)]
*  And it's frustrating because I was a Democrat until 1997. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=159.68s)]
*  I don't even recognize the party anymore. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=162.6s)]
*  But yeah, you know, the whole goal for me, I'm very passionate and it comes from my heart. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=165.84s)]
*  I just don't want pedophiles to get any special treatment or to be allowed early out of prison. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=170.56s)]
*  Well, I've got to think. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  I know New Mexico and you're right, it's a very moderate state, mostly Democrats. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=180.36s)]
*  I would think the majority of people in New Mexico, the voters would be in favor of this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=185.32s)]
*  Yes, I think the voters are definitely in favor of this because I don't know anybody that's on the side of pedophiles. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  The problem is that I have more leeway on my side of the party. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=198.56s)]
*  I can disagree with my party all day long and I do. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  They'll tell you that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  If I don't feel that something is correct or right for my district, I won't vote for them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=206.96s)]
*  But I think there's more of a push on their side where they have to align and it's all or nothing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  So I think they've got some pushback on that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=214.56s)]
*  And that's really unfortunate. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  That's really, really unfortunate. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=217.96s)]
*  I think that's a really smart insight. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=219.8s)]
*  They stick together. That's where their power is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=221.8s)]
*  They know it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=225.12s)]
*  And it works, unfortunately. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  Stephanie Lord, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwjteW18G0&t=226.4s)]
