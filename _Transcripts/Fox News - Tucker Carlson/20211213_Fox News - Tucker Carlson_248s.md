# Julian Assange's family concerned for his safety as extradition looms
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 13, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8)
*  So you've probably heard the name Julian Assange and you've probably gathered from all the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=0.0s)]
*  shouting about Julian Assange from our political class that he's some sort of international [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=4.92s)]
*  spy who hacked our computers and stole our secrets. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=8.68s)]
*  But that's not at all what Julian Assange is or has ever been. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  He didn't hack anybody's computers. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=15.16s)]
*  He's a journalist. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=16.84s)]
*  He reprinted facts that were deeply embarrassing to our political class, the Democratic National [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Committee and to, above all, the foreign policy establishment, which has an awful lot to be [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=23.78s)]
*  embarrassed of. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=28.04s)]
*  And for doing that, the New York Times has done things like that for a hundred years, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=29.52s)]
*  no problem. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=32.84s)]
*  Julian Assange does it? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=33.84s)]
*  Well, he's been incarcerated for almost a decade since the summer of 2012. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=34.84s)]
*  He's now, for the last two odd years, been in maximum security prison in the UK. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=39.32s)]
*  He could be coming to this country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=45.96s)]
*  So what exactly is going to happen next with Julian Assange and why is no one defending [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=48.8s)]
*  him? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=54.44s)]
*  Gabriel Shipton is Julian Assange's brother. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=57.5s)]
*  Mr. Shipton, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=58.9s)]
*  And by the way, when I say no one's defending him, of course, many people are defending [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=60.78s)]
*  Julian Assange. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=63.02s)]
*  But I mean, no one at the higher reaches of American journalism, for example. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=64.34s)]
*  They are silent on this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=69.5s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=70.74s)]
*  Well, I think, Tucker, they've been able to ignore this case for a while. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=72.06s)]
*  You know, it's been at arm's length in the UK. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=77.78s)]
*  Last Friday, the UK High Court ruled that Julian could be extradited. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=82.46s)]
*  They approved the extradition to the USA. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=88.5s)]
*  So the case is now coming here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  You know, Julian has a chance to appeal, but it was the chief justice, the chief justice [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=94.33999999999999s)]
*  of the UK, who's the highest judge in England and Wales, who ordered the extradition. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=99.78s)]
*  So it's very unlikely that an appeal will go ahead. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=105.6s)]
*  So I think that people here can, the media, the government can no longer ignore that this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=108.84s)]
*  case is coming. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=116.16s)]
*  This criminalisation of, it's basically a Biden administration, the Biden administration [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=117.72s)]
*  has criminalised telling the truth with this indictment. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=123.42s)]
*  And it's even worse than that, actually. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=126.04s)]
*  They've criminalised knowing of our classified information. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=127.76s)]
*  And so now it's coming to this country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=131.84s)]
*  The extradition has been ordered by the High Court. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=134.44s)]
*  I don't think people here can any longer ignore it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=137.28s)]
*  You've got to ask yourself, though, and I don't think you live in the United States, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  but we're in the middle of a crime wave in which many thousands of people have been killed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=144.0s)]
*  over and above last year's numbers, in which many thousands more have died of drug overdoses [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=148.0s)]
*  from drugs that are coming. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  So we have a lot of crime problems in the United States right now, but the Biden administration [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  is very focused on getting its hands on your brother. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=156.12s)]
*  Why is getting your brother more important than bringing, say, murderers to justice? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=159.66s)]
*  Well, I think the people who run our democracies now would like to rule them with impunity. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=165.52s)]
*  They don't want people to know what's been done in their name. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  They want to keep secrets. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=177.52s)]
*  They want to, they don't want the public to be informed, basically. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  I think that's why. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=184.72s)]
*  And they're creating, Julian, they're making an example out of Julian. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=186.28s)]
*  They're saying to people, if you tell the truth about our secrets, if you tell the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=189.72s)]
*  truth about the security state or anything, really, this is what's going to happen to you. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=195.4s)]
*  You're going to be locked in a prison for the rest of your life. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  Your reputation will be destroyed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=206.12s)]
*  You'll be taken away from your family. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=208.44s)]
*  I have to ask you a final question, which is a depressing question, but I have to ask, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=212.0s)]
*  if your brother is extradited to the United States, do you think he'll survive? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=215.68s)]
*  Look, no, I don't. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=219.24s)]
*  You know, we can look, you know, look, prisoners here can't be kept safe. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=221.28s)]
*  Even the most high-profile prisoners like Jeffrey Epstein, he couldn't be kept safe [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=225.92s)]
*  in prison. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=229.84s)]
*  You know, so what hope, what hope will Julian have here? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=230.84s)]
*  I think, I think, you know, if he gets extradited, he will most likely die. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=234.56s)]
*  Ah, you make this sound like Bolivia, which makes me ashamed, but you're probably not [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=240.24s)]
*  wrong. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=244.48s)]
*  Gabriel, thank you so much for coming on tonight. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=245.48s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-J3jGTaTt8&t=246.84s)]
