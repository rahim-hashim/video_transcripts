# This will go slow, but cast a broader net than Sussmann: Former attorney general
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8)
*  So what does all of this mean? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=0.0s)]
*  Matt Whitaker is former acting attorney general, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=2.0s)]
*  and he joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=4.7s)]
*  Matt, great to see you tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=5.62s)]
*  I will. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=7.2s)]
*  This is, I think it's fair to say, without exaggeration, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=7.7s)]
*  this is big. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=11.42s)]
*  Tell us what you read into what's happening in the Durham [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=12.94s)]
*  investigation and the trial of Michael Sussman as of today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=15.74s)]
*  Yeah, this Sussman trial is so important for two reasons. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=19.02s)]
*  One, it's holding somebody accountable for lying to the FBI [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=21.82s)]
*  and upholding the rule of law. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=24.98s)]
*  But on the other hand, it is also [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=26.62s)]
*  because it is telling the story of what the Clinton campaign did, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  spreading disinformation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=33.68s)]
*  Really, that was in 2017 that our current national security [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=35.64s)]
*  adviser, Jake Sullivan, was talking [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=40.72s)]
*  about this same fake news, false information [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=42.84s)]
*  that Hillary Clinton had ordered the code red to disseminate [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=46.2s)]
*  to the media. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=49.0s)]
*  And Sussman, prior to that, had gone to the FBI and saying, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=49.84s)]
*  I don't represent any clients. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=53.540000000000006s)]
*  But he did. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  He represented the campaign when he delivered this information [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=56.42s)]
*  to the FBI. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=59.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that can go without being highlighted [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=59.94s)]
*  what you just said. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=62.22s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, the man we just saw [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=62.78s)]
*  lying on national television, is the one [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  in charge of giving us daily updates on the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=65.9s)]
*  That is the man in charge, in a large part, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=69.34s)]
*  of our national security now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=72.42s)]
*  Matt, where do you think this goes from here? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=74.22s)]
*  There's a sense among many watching [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=76.02s)]
*  that this is just the beginning of John Durham's investigation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=77.94s)]
*  Now that Michael Sussman is on trial, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=81.42s)]
*  we'll see where that verdict comes in. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  But where does it go from here, after Sussman? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=85.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's going to go to a broader group that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=88.44s)]
*  was involved in creating this disinformation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Because if you remember, in Durham's filings [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=96.4s)]
*  before the trial started, he suggested [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=98.48s)]
*  there was a joint venture or a criminal conspiracy [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  among several people to execute this plan of lying to the FBI [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=104.12s)]
*  and trying to launch a investigation that would [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=109.44s)]
*  lead to this October surprise. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  I think it's going to continue to go slow, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=114.06s)]
*  but intentionally try to cast a net that's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=117.58s)]
*  broader than just Michael Sussman. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=121.46s)]
*  Let's leave it here, Matt, with this question. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=123.86s)]
*  Does that net get cast wide enough [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=125.86s)]
*  that it does land over Hillary Clinton? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, like you said earlier, Robbie Moog testified today [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=135.06s)]
*  in court that Hillary Clinton said, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=138.66s)]
*  share this disinformation with the media. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  And remember, these are the same people [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=144.88s)]
*  that had the disinformation about Hunter's laptop. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=146.6s)]
*  So I think Durham is finally going [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=148.8s)]
*  to make a statement to many of these people [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=151.4s)]
*  that this type of lying to the American people is over. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=153.32s)]
*  We can only hope. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=156.76s)]
*  Matt Whitaker, thank you so much. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhiTl2qEC8&t=157.92000000000002s)]
