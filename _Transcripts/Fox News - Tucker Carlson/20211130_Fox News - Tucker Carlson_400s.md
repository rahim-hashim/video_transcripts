# Tucker: Media corruption is deeper than you know
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=0.0s)]
*  Big changes in the tiny hot house and it is tiny of cable news this evening. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=9.64s)]
*  CNN's top rated anchor Chris Cuomo has been pulled off the air likely for good. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=14.96s)]
*  You'll probably never see him on camera again. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=18.92s)]
*  For us here at Fox, it feels like the end of something. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=21.88s)]
*  Like most Americans, we never actually watched the Chris Cuomo show, assuming that was its [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=24.68s)]
*  But over the years we saw his clips and they transfixed us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=29.72s)]
*  Very often as a public service, but also because honestly we could not help ourselves, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  we brought them to you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  How, we wondered, did a man who could barely speak English wind up with a paying job on television? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=39.64s)]
*  Was it some kind of weird affirmative action program for the illiterate? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  We never figured it out. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=49.08s)]
*  But it was remarkable to see it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=50.36s)]
*  Sentence after badly mangled sentence. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=53.08s)]
*  A boulea baze of incomprehensible grammar. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=56.2s)]
*  You couldn't understand any of it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=58.76s)]
*  It was a kind of performance art. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=61.08s)]
*  A communicator wholly unable to communicate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=62.68s)]
*  And then there was the weightlifting. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=66.2s)]
*  There was nothing wrong with lifting weights or keeping in shape, obviously. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=67.4s)]
*  But there was always something very wrong with the videos that Chris Cuomo had shot of himself [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=71.24s)]
*  and then put on the internet. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=76.2s)]
*  Imagine wanting other people to see this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=77.72s)]
*  Sorry, I've been really busy, but I am working out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=81.24s)]
*  I mean, let's be honest, you want to look like that by nothing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=83.4s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=85.56s)]
*  Let's get a little pre-show pump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=86.36s)]
*  What does that say? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=88.2s)]
*  Cuomo prime time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=90.52s)]
*  Hashtag let's get after it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=91.72s)]
*  Hundred pounds. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, just kind of just work it out. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=94.12s)]
*  A little bit of light stuff. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=95.88s)]
*  News time. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=104.28s)]
*  We're also using that Fred Flynn soon dumbbell. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=107.48s)]
*  This is multitasking for a real man. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  Oh, his poor staff. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=114.6s)]
*  So yes, we did make fun of Chris Cuomo quite a bit on this show. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=115.64s)]
*  In fact, pretty relentlessly for the past five years. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=119.0s)]
*  Chris Cuomo was a buffoon. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  He was also in the way that buffoons tend to be incredibly self-righteous and false. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=124.36s)]
*  Here he is, for example, pretending to emerge from self-imposed quarantine in his basement [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=130.44s)]
*  after recovering from COVID. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=136.2s)]
*  We had a huge day today in Casa Cuomo. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=138.76s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=141.24s)]
*  All right, here is the official reentry from the basement cleared by CDC. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=142.04s)]
*  A little sweaty. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  Just worked out. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=149.16s)]
*  It happens. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  This is what I've been dreaming of literally for weeks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=151.72s)]
*  This is the dream just to be back up here doing normal things. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=155.64s)]
*  Oh, his poor family. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  He pulled them into it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=163.48s)]
*  We learned later the whole thing was fake. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=165.48s)]
*  Chris Cuomo had to be in the hospital. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=167.56s)]
*  He had to be in the hospital. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  The whole thing was fake. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=170.2s)]
*  Chris Cuomo hadn't quarantined. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=171.56s)]
*  In fact, he'd been out and about, wandering around Long Island without a mask, yelling [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=173.72s)]
*  at anyone who questioned him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=178.28s)]
*  Now, no one else at the time in the media seemed bothered at all by this, but it struck [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  us as a big deal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  It was too phony. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=186.11999999999998s)]
*  But his bosses didn't care. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  Before you knew it, Chris Cuomo was back on television barking at you for, yes, not wearing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  a mask. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=195.56s)]
*  Put on the damn mask. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=197.0s)]
*  If you're in California, if you're in Riverside, wear the mask. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=198.44s)]
*  If you want to avoid situations like this where you live, wear the mask. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=201.72s)]
*  If we care about doing the right things, I wear a mask for you as much as I wear it for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=205.64s)]
*  me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=209.16s)]
*  I had the disease. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=209.64s)]
*  You need to wear a damn mask. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=210.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  And you have to take care of other people in your community, and it's got to be about [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=212.76s)]
*  us because the help's not going to come from above. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=215.48s)]
*  Said the guy who screamed at someone else for pointing out that he was not wearing a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=219.32s)]
*  mask. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=224.12s)]
*  Now, at the time, that seemed pretty unforgivable to us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  In fact, watching the tape, it still does seem unforgivable. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  But once again, Chris Cuomo's bosses weren't bothered at all. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=230.6s)]
*  At CNN, there is no penalty for falseness. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  The only thing you can't do at CNN, the thing that they will never tolerate, is displeasing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=237.0s)]
*  the people in charge. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  That means not simply Jeff Zucker, who runs the company, but the billionaires who run [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=243.32s)]
*  our country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=247.32s)]
*  If you cross them, you're done. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=248.6s)]
*  So this morning when we saw the Atlantic magazine, we knew it was curtains for Chris [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  Cuomo. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=255.72000000000003s)]
*  The Atlantic is owned by Steve Jobs' widow. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  It functions as a kind of modern social register, a place for the ruling class to talk to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=259.16s)]
*  itself. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=263.48s)]
*  And the Atlantic decided that it was deeply displeased Chris Cuomo had dared to help his [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=264.36s)]
*  brother, the former governor of New York, when he was accused of sexual harassment. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  Chris Cuomo must go, the Atlantic declared. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=272.68s)]
*  And then we knew he would. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=275.56s)]
*  We knew it was over. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=276.6s)]
*  In the world that Jeff Zucker lives in, the Atlantic makes the rules. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=277.72s)]
*  Cuomo was done. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  And that's when, for the first time ever, and very unexpectedly, we started to feel [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  sorry for Chris Cuomo. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=288.12s)]
*  Helping his brother is not the worst thing Chris Cuomo ever did. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  In fact, it may have been the best thing he ever did. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=293.8s)]
*  Not because Andrew Cuomo was a good person. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=296.92s)]
*  He certainly wasn't a good person. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=298.92s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo was loathsome. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=300.44000000000005s)]
*  But Andrew Cuomo was Chris Cuomo's brother. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  And that's what you do with brothers. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=305.24s)]
*  Even the loathsome ones. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=307.24s)]
*  You help them when they need it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=309.16s)]
*  Period. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=312.12s)]
*  It's called loyalty. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  At CNN, as at the rest of the media, this is an alien concept. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  Is there a single person at CNN or any other left-wing network who would risk his job to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=318.6s)]
*  help his own brother? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=324.12s)]
*  No. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=325.56s)]
*  Above all these people are careerists. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  Ruthless careerists. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=329.16s)]
*  They would betray anyone to get ahead. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=330.6s)]
*  If Jeff Zucker told this guy to denounce his own wife on television, do you think he'd [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=332.92s)]
*  hesitate before doing it? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=337.0s)]
*  Well, of course he wouldn't. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=338.2s)]
*  Not for a second. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=339.16s)]
*  So when we tell you that the media are corrupt, we don't just mean they're corrupt politically. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=341.16s)]
*  It is much deeper than that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=346.12s)]
*  They don't acknowledge the most important rules in life. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=348.52s)]
*  Your first obligation is to your family. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=351.72s)]
*  Your first obligation is not to the state. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8XwtvEnCM&t=355.4s)]
