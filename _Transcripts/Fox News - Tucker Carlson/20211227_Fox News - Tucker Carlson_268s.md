# USA swimming official resigns amid transgender athlete controversy
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU)
*  Cynthia Millen has spent three decades as a U.S. swimming official, but she has just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=0.0s)]
*  resigned in protest over transgender swimmer Leah Thomas of the University of Pennsylvania, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=8.08s)]
*  who is a biological male that has been allowed to compete against females. Thomas is now [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=13.52s)]
*  dominating swimming events and setting records. In her resignation letter, Millen simply said [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  she, quote, can't support this and that, quote, everything fair about swimming is being destroyed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=25.3s)]
*  Cynthia Millen joins me now. Cynthia, listen, thank you for joining me on the show and thank [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=31.34s)]
*  you for your bravery. I guess I'm just curious, what kind of response have you gotten since [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=35.38s)]
*  you resigned from your position? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=41.04s)]
*  Sean, thanks very much. I've gotten a lot of kind comments from fellow officials, former [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  officials and from parents of swimmers and swimmers. The fact is that swimming is a sport [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=51.64s)]
*  in which bodies compete against bodies. Identities do not compete against identities. And from [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=57.54s)]
*  the very beginning, when you start out as an age grouper, swimmers are divided by sex [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=63.78s)]
*  and by age group, eight and under, nine, ten, et cetera, all the way up, because from the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=68.94s)]
*  very beginning, swimming, USA swimming, recognizes that boys swim differently from girls. And [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=74.1s)]
*  this is just accentuated when boys and girls go through puberty. Boys will always have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=81.1s)]
*  larger lung capacity, larger hearts, greater circulation, a bigger skeleton and less fat. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=87.66s)]
*  Girls go through puberty and they have a double whammy. They not only grow breasts and hips, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=94.94s)]
*  but they have periods and they often have a totally different center of gravity. They [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=99.58s)]
*  have to learn how to swim over again. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=104.22s)]
*  So while Leah Thomas is a child of God, he is a biological male who is competing against [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=106.82s)]
*  women and no matter how much testosterone suppression drugs he takes, he will always [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=113.94s)]
*  be a biological male and have this advantage. And it's horrible. The statement for women [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=119.86s)]
*  then is you don't matter. What you do is not important. And little girls are going [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  to be thrown under the bus by all of this. He's going to be destroying women's swimming. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=131.9s)]
*  Cynthia, so true. And I guess my next question for you is, you know, young women who push [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=136.18s)]
*  back against biological males competing in their sport, they can be bullied. The social [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=141.9s)]
*  media blowback can be great. But you look to moms across America, moms of athletes, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=146.6s)]
*  or you look to pro athletes or Olympic athletes who competed in these sports as women to stand [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=152.86s)]
*  up for girls today to compete against other women. Are you seeing that kind of mother [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=158.58s)]
*  support or other kind of athletes in the Olympics that stand up and support this movement to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=163.0s)]
*  say biological girls should compete against biological girls and biological boys should [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=167.62s)]
*  compete against biological boys? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=172.66000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's great, Sean. I'm getting great letters from dads of daughters and also moms [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=175.38000000000002s)]
*  But we're also seeing some past Olympians stepping up and saying, no, this is wrong. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=183.06s)]
*  We are, we must remember that our Olympic swimming for women was built on great swimmers [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=189.38s)]
*  like Jill Turkle, Shirley Babashov, Janet Evans, Jenny Thompson, all of these women [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=194.1s)]
*  who worked so hard before Title IX when they didn't have the opportunities that men had. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  And it would be such a shame. It would be such a travesty to throw it all away now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=205.58s)]
*  And this is what will happen. We must face facts. Men are different from women. Men swimmers [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=210.38s)]
*  are different from women. And they will always be faster than women. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=216.5s)]
*  You know, Cynthia, as a father of six girls, I have nine kids, six are girls. Thank you [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=221.98s)]
*  for standing up for girls to actually have the ability to compete and win when they compete [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=228.78s)]
*  against other girls. And I hope that every mother out there, every father out there, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=233.9s)]
*  every Olympic swimmer or any women athlete stands up and stands with you to say this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=238.68s)]
*  is wrong and it's unfair. And thank you for lending your voice to this cause and standing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  up and resigning in protest. You're a great American. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=248.36s)]
*  Thank you very much, Sean. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvYn4ChbPU&t=254.76000000000002s)]
