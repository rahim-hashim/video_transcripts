# Woman gives emotional account of gender transition
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw)
*  Well, some of the medical professionals who make money [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=0.0s)]
*  by mutilating the bodies of young women [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=2.6s)]
*  are now being sued for what they've done. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=4.24s)]
*  Case in point, in 2020, at the age of 30, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=6.36s)]
*  Camille Kiefel says she was approved for a double mastectomy [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=9.92s)]
*  after a few virtual visits with doctors [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=12.96s)]
*  at gender clinics in the state of Oregon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=15.44s)]
*  Now she's suing her social worker and her therapist, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  as well as the clinics involved. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=20.04s)]
*  Camille Kiefel joins us, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=22.0s)]
*  along with her attorney, Lauren Adams-Bone. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=23.2s)]
*  Camille, thanks so much for coming on tonight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=26.2s)]
*  I understand the outlines of your suit, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=28.56s)]
*  but tell us why you think you were wronged, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=31.48s)]
*  apart from the legal case you're making. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=34.72s)]
*  So, part of it was that... [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=38.56s)]
*  So, I sought out... [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  It's okay, I'm gonna give you a second to collect yourself [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=52.88s)]
*  and ask... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=55.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=56.28s)]
*  All right, and ask your attorney [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=57.28s)]
*  about the case that you are making, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  and I hope you can fill in some of the emotional blanks there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=61.6s)]
*  Lauren, what are you arguing on behalf of your client [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=64.84s)]
*  in this case? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, hi. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=71.44s)]
*  This case is about mental health providers [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=72.48s)]
*  who breached their duty of care [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=75.36s)]
*  and violated the professional ethical standards [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=77.64s)]
*  of the state of Oregon, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=80.48s)]
*  leading to irreparable harm to Camille, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=82.8s)]
*  and doing so by making false representations to Medicaid. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=85.8s)]
*  So, tell us what... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  And so they made money by doing this, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=93.96s)]
*  and thank you for pointing that out. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=95.28s)]
*  But what is their obligation? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  What is the obligation of the people who treated your client [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  that they didn't meet, specifically? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=101.6s)]
*  They have an obligation to treat them as an individual [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=105.88s)]
*  and to treat them according to evidence-based medicine. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=109.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=114.04s)]
*  And they met her one time each and wrote a letter [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=115.04s)]
*  to have healthy body parts removed... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=119.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=122.4s)]
*  ...on the basis of an identity that, yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=123.4s)]
*  Did you... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=126.76s)]
*  Well, that seems prima facie irresponsible. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=127.76s)]
*  I can't imagine anyone wouldn't see that as irresponsible. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=130.6s)]
*  Camille, did you feel like they cared about you as a person, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=133.56s)]
*  cared about making you better as a person? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=138.68s)]
*  I think that they were highly influenced by an ideology, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=142.16s)]
*  and that has no place in our medical system. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=145.12s)]
*  And had they looked at the underlying health issues, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=148.12s)]
*  which, as those resolved, I realized that I was not non-binary, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=150.56s)]
*  that I was a woman all along and had been dealing with trauma, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=155.64s)]
*  then I would have never needed the surgery. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=158.72s)]
*  And so they have a responsibility to their patients [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=162.64s)]
*  to look at things from a nuanced perspective [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=166.0s)]
*  and not be influenced by ideology. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=171.24s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=173.28s)]
*  I mean, if they treated cancer patients like that, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=174.52s)]
*  no one would survive. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=176.4s)]
*  And so nicely put. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=177.56s)]
*  Thank you for that. I know it's hard to talk about it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=179.12s)]
*  So I appreciate you both coming on tonight. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much and good luck with your suit. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=182.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  And I hope that you're changing your life. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=195.4s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrkj3iW1bvw&t=196.68s)]
