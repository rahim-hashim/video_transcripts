# Trump: I don't think Biden can run again
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg)
*  Do you think Biden will stay in the race? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=0.0s)]
*  Look, I watch him just like you do. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=4.08s)]
*  And I think it's almost inappropriate for me to say it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=8.84s)]
*  I don't see how it's possible, but there's something wrong. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=12.92s)]
*  I saw his answer today on television [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=16.64s)]
*  about whether or not he was going to run to a very nice guy [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=19.76s)]
*  named Al Roker. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=22.04s)]
*  I mean, you can't get a softer question than that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=23.92s)]
*  That was a long answer. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  Talking about the eggs and this and that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=29.08s)]
*  Look, I don't think he can. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQVCVBdSJg&t=30.96s)]
