# Will Cain: The country has been unified against Biden
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc)
*  Well, good evening and welcome to a special edition of Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight I'm Will Kane in for Tucker. Now here's a stat that puts the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=3.62s)]
*  country's collapse into perspective, maybe more than any other. The Dow [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=8.34s)]
*  Jones just recorded its eighth straight weekly loss. The last time that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=12.84s)]
*  happened was all the way back in 1932 around the height of the Great [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=18.3s)]
*  Depression. Right now, a lot of Americans are wondering, how did we get [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=21.92s)]
*  here so quickly, just a year and a half into Joe Biden? It's been a rapid [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=26.52s)]
*  decline. If you get a moment this weekend, go on the Internet and pull up [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=32.64s)]
*  Joe Biden's inaugural address. Looking back, it's remarkable, not because of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=36.06s)]
*  what's in the speech, but because of what's missing from the speech. You [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=41.16s)]
*  won't hear a single mention of the issues Americans are most concerned [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=44.64s)]
*  about. Nothing on inflation, poverty, gas prices, the stock market, nothing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=48.92s)]
*  on government spending, energy independence, fentanyl overdoses and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=54.02s)]
*  absolutely nothing on border security. In fact, there isn't a single mention [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=57.74s)]
*  of policy in the entire address. Instead, Joe Biden talked about himself. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=63.1s)]
*  He compared himself to Abraham Lincoln issuing the Emancipation Proclamation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=67.9s)]
*  He told us that only Joe Biden could unite Americans and save us from [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=73.5s)]
*  quote, bitterness and fury. Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=78.38s)]
*  this bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. And I [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=85.94s)]
*  ask every American to join me in this cause. We can join forces, stop the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=93.06s)]
*  shouting and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  bitterness and fury. And so today, at this time in this place, let's start [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=107.06s)]
*  afresh. So a year and a half later, I think right here on Tucker Carlson [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=113.94s)]
*  tonight, we can announce that Joe Biden has finally succeeded in unifying the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  country against Joe Biden. And the polling makes that very clear. Listen to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=122.96s)]
*  this. According to a CNN survey from this week, only 40% of Americans [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=128.82s)]
*  Joe Biden's job performance. That's worse than Jimmy Carter at the same point [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=133.82s)]
*  in his presidency. 65% of Americans are concerned about the future of the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=138.14s)]
*  country and 21% are just flat out scared. Just 14% are excited or optimistic. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  And I would love to meet that 14%. An NBC News poll came up with similar [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=149.34s)]
*  numbers. Just 39% of Americans, according to NBC, approve of Joe Biden's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=154.26s)]
*  performance. 62% disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy. Those numbers [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=158.9s)]
*  are also worse than Jimmy Carter's 71% of Americans 71 disapprove of Joe Biden's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  handling of the cost of living 58 upset with his border policies. And listen to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=173.34s)]
*  this. Another new poll from Quinnipiac found that Joe Biden has just a 26% [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  approval rating among Hispanics. It's his lowest among any demographic group. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=184.82s)]
*  That's a flood of numbers coming at you. But as bad as those numbers are, there's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=189.9s)]
*  evidence that they could be overestimating Joe Biden's popularity. A [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=194.73999999999998s)]
*  political science professor named Eddie Zipper looked at a recent poll by Marist [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=198.98s)]
*  and the poll found that Joe Biden's approval rating is 39%. That's in line [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=203.94s)]
*  what we saw from the other polls. But the Marist Institute poll reported that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=208.04s)]
*  Joe Biden's popularity was much higher. In fact, almost 50% among baby boomers [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=211.94s)]
*  in the silent generation. Can that be right? Zipper did some number crunching [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  and he found that 52% of people who are over 65. Well, they voted for Donald [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=223.26s)]
*  Trump in 2020. And the Marist Institute poll found that 2% just 2% of people [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=227.7s)]
*  that supported Donald Trump in 2020 now have shifted to having a favorable view [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=234.26s)]
*  of Joe Biden. So where is this new support for Joe Biden among baby boomers [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=239.66s)]
*  and the silent generation? It just it doesn't add up. And here's the point at [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=245.22s)]
*  the end of all of this arithmetic. The polls could be overstating Joe Biden's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=250.02s)]
*  popularity among older Americans. And that may be due to a sampling error. If [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=254.9s)]
*  that's the case, Joe Biden's lower than 39%. Now that would explain why no one [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=260.06s)]
*  in the media not even CNN is bothering to defend Joe Biden anymore. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=266.5s)]
*  Just 16% say the country's headed in the right direction, while a whopping 75% [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=271.1s)]
*  say we're on the wrong track. In fact, that wrong track number has been 70 plus [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=275.82s)]
*  for seven months. There are a lot of push button issues that do have people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=279.42s)]
*  infuriated inflation at a 40 year high, I think is one of them. The anxieties [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=283.02s)]
*  that Americans are feeling over inflation, high gas prices, and it's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=287.62s)]
*  really bubbling up. You see that President Biden has a 40% approval [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=291.74s)]
*  rating in the CNN poll of polls 55% disapprove. This is a huge warning sign [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=296.1s)]
*  for Democrats. If you were a doctor and you were looking at this chart, you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=302.18s)]
*  would say these vital signs are very, very bad. The people are just really [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  pissed off. They're really angry about what's going on and they don't feel [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  like anyone can help them. And they tried it with the Trump administration, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=313.86s)]
*  then they switched. They handed power in Washington to Democrats and now [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=316.82000000000005s)]
*  inflation has gone rampant. People are really unhappy with their lives. I'd say [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=320.1s)]
*  that's a fair summation. 40% 39%. It's very, very bad and people are pissed off. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=324.1s)]
*  Now from his inauguration speech, though, we know Joe Biden didn't see any [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=330.74s)]
*  of this coming. He didn't think it was possible to wreck a functioning economy [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=333.9s)]
*  in just a year and a half. But the signs were there. The nation's monetary [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=339.1s)]
*  supply had grown dramatically in 2020 due to pandemic spending. But Joe Biden [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=343.78s)]
*  ignored those warning signs. He was laser focused on demonizing his political [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=348.18s)]
*  opponents instead of managing the economy. In a single bill, the American [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=353.98s)]
*  Rescue Act, Biden spent $19 trillion. And according to an article by the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=358.46000000000004s)]
*  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, that action led directly to inflation. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=363.66s)]
*  Quote estimates suggest that the fiscal support measures designed to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=369.82s)]
*  counteract the severity of the pandemics economic effect may have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  contributed to this divergence by raising inflation three percentage [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=377.5s)]
*  points by the end of 2021. But Joe Biden kept going. He spent another trillion [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=381.3s)]
*  dollars on infrastructure. The result, the highest inflation rate we have seen [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=388.58s)]
*  in decades. This morning, America seems trapped in a vortex of bad economic [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=393.78s)]
*  news, sky high food prices, pump prices at record levels, soaring rents up 16% [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=399.26s)]
*  in one year. Covid lockdowns in China, the world's manufacturing center [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=405.42s)]
*  choking the global supply chain, U. S. Corporate profits sinking Russian oil [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=409.74s)]
*  under partial embargo, Ukrainian wheat exports at a standstill and all of it [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=414.34s)]
*  feeding 40 year high inflation that Americans are paying for every day. So [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=419.3s)]
*  if you're wondering how all of this caught Joe Biden by surprise, consider [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=424.06s)]
*  who's suffering the most here. The people hit hardest by Joe Biden's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=427.58s)]
*  economic policies aren't in urban areas like San Francisco or New York, which [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=431.58s)]
*  are solidly blue. Joe Biden's base isn't bearing the brunt of this. His bubble [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=436.58s)]
*  is sufficiently insulated. No, the people suffering the most are in remote [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  rural areas in small towns, towns like Midland, Texas, places that are [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=446.38s)]
*  overwhelmingly conservative. It's a lot harder to ferry food and supplies into [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=451.62s)]
*  a place like Midland because it's so far from urban centers. And a Fox [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=456.09999999999997s)]
*  multimedia reporter just went to Midland, which has recorded the highest [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=460.02s)]
*  inflation rate in the country at roughly 10%. People in this west Texas [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=463.5s)]
*  town of Midland say it's hitting them hardest. We're somewhat isolated between [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=469.5s)]
*  El Paso and Dallas, Fort Worth. And so there's a lot of distance and it takes [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=475.22s)]
*  you 4 or 5 hours to go to either one. So travel costs, transportation costs [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=481.3s)]
*  that raises prices. Midland has a population of just over 140,000, but [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=486.54s)]
*  it's giving big cities like New York, Phoenix and Dallas a run for their money [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=491.7s)]
*  when it comes to inflation. It's had the highest rate in the country for the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=495.86s)]
*  last six months. The West Texas Food Bank says over the last few weeks, the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=499.46s)]
*  number of families it serves has tripled. Most of the clients we serve, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=503.5s)]
*  you know, 27 to 30% of them have never needed any form of public assistance [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=508.06s)]
*  before their rent has gone up. They cannot keep up with the price of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=513.86s)]
*  groceries that they're seeing right now in the grocery stores, and they can't [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=517.18s)]
*  keep up with the cost of fuel. Those are my people, West Texas. Those are our [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=520.38s)]
*  people, Americans. And this is Joe Biden's unity strategy. Americans united [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=524.94s)]
*  in being poor, more divided and more scared than they were when he took [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=531.3000000000001s)]
*  office. It just so happens that once again, people who didn't vote for Joe [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr0n57fEwc&t=536.14s)]
