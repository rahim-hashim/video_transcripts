# Tucker: This the point where we have to draw the line
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=0.0s)]
*  When Elon Musk first announced that he was buying Twitter, it was pretty obvious the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=4.96s)]
*  Democratic Party would soon become unhinged. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=9.44s)]
*  Not just angry or annoyed in the way you're very used to, but instead legitimately terrified [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=12.16s)]
*  and hysterical. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=18.36s)]
*  Imagine how you'd feel if an armed intruder broke into your home at three in the morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=19.36s)]
*  You couldn't exactly know where things were going, but you'd be dead certain that everything [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=23.04s)]
*  was at stake. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  That's how Democrats feel right now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  Because in fact, everything is at stake. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=30.88s)]
*  Joe Biden cannot continue to control this country if you have free access to information. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=33.6s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=38.44s)]
*  Biden certainly is not improving your life. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  He's not even trying to improve your life. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=41.8s)]
*  So the best he can do is lie to you and demand that you believe it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=44.22s)]
*  But to do that, he needs to make certain that nobody else can talk. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=48.08s)]
*  Because if you were to hear the truth, you might not obey. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=51.44s)]
*  How is Biden going to pull that off? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=55.16s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=56.28s)]
*  Well, one option would be to get men with guns to tell you to shut up. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=57.68s)]
*  Most Americans probably haven't thought of that because this isn't Africa or Eastern [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=62.2s)]
*  Europe. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=65.36s)]
*  This is America. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=66.36s)]
*  And we don't do things like that here and never have. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=67.36s)]
*  More precisely, we haven't until now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=69.64s)]
*  But now Joe Biden is president and everything is different. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=73.04s)]
*  So today, to herald the coming of the new Soviet America, the administration announced [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=76.28s)]
*  its own Ministry of Truth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=80.8s)]
*  This will be called the Disinformation Governance Board. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  Laugh if you want, but just to show you they're not kidding around here, this board is not [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  part of the State Department or any other agency focused on foreign threats from abroad. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=90.84s)]
*  No. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  The Disinformation Governance Board is part of the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  DHS is a law enforcement agency designed to police the United States and that, by the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  way, has a famously large stockpile of ammunition. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  So it's not a joke at all. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=109.12s)]
*  Here's DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=111.28s)]
*  We have just established a Mis- and Disinformation Governance Board in the Department of Homeland [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=114.4s)]
*  Security to more effectively combat this threat, not only to election security, but to our [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=120.2s)]
*  homeland security. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=126.84s)]
*  Oh, so one of America's top law enforcement officers just announced this to the Congress [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=128.88s)]
*  that actually we're going to be policing what you say. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=134.4s)]
*  And everyone in the room kind of nods, oh, yeah, it's totally normal. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  But here's what he didn't say. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=139.84s)]
*  So America's told us that disinformation is a threat to homeland security. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=140.84s)]
*  Now, he's the head of the Department of Homeland Security, so presumably he would know since [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=143.44s)]
*  assessing threats to homeland security is his job. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=148.08s)]
*  But what he didn't tell us is how he's defining disinformation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=151.54s)]
*  So here you have this new and terrifying thing that the Biden administration is so concerned [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=156.2s)]
*  about that it's created a new agency to fight it, but Mayorkas never said or even hinted [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=159.58s)]
*  as to what it might be. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=164.62s)]
*  So the man in charge of the Disinformation Governing Board never defined disinformation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=166.86s)]
*  It's almost unbelievable when you think about it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=174.02s)]
*  Would you declare war on a country you couldn't name? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=176.82000000000002s)]
*  Would you sentence someone to death for a crime you couldn't describe? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  Of course you wouldn't, not if you were a sane and decent person, because you can't [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=183.02s)]
*  have justice without precise definitions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=186.96s)]
*  That's why we have very large books of law that define what is allowed and what is not. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=191.02s)]
*  But they're not defining the core concept at the heart of what is effectively a new [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=197.06s)]
*  law enforcement agency. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=201.82s)]
*  Maybe that's because Mayorkas doesn't want justice and neither does the president he serves. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=203.58s)]
*  They want power. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=208.34s)]
*  And to get power, they plan to control what you think. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  Watch Mayorkas explain. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=213.1s)]
*  We have so many different efforts underway to equip local communities to identify individuals [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=215.46s)]
*  who very well could be descending into violence by reason of ideologies of hate, false narratives, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=223.02s)]
*  or other disinformation and misinformation propagated on social media and other platforms. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=232.3s)]
*  Oh. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=239.94s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=242.06s)]
*  So one of our biggest law enforcement agencies has men with guns around the country doing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=243.1s)]
*  so many things to stop disinformation and false narratives. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=248.32s)]
*  Those aren't even lies. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=253.66s)]
*  They're just deviations from the approved script. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=254.66s)]
*  Mayorkas told us again that men with guns plan to, quote, identify individuals who could [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=257.62s)]
*  be descending into violence, could be descending, not people who've committed violence or even [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=262.14s)]
*  been accused of any crime at all. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=266.74s)]
*  DHS is instead using law enforcement powers to identify and punish people who think the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=269.54s)]
*  wrong things. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=274.82s)]
*  That would be opponents of the Biden administration. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=275.82s)]
*  Is this dystopian fiction? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=277.86s)]
*  No, it's happening right in front of us. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=278.86s)]
*  That means that Joe Biden's partisan political enemies are now officially enemies of the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=281.0s)]
*  state. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=284.82s)]
*  How is this happening in America? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  Good question, but it is happening. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=289.18s)]
*  And Biden's new thought cop-in-chief has been revealed. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=291.42s)]
*  She's a 33-year-old highly self-confident young woman called Nina Jankiewicz. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  Jankiewicz comes from a place called the Wilson Center. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=299.06s)]
*  That's a nonprofit named for America's other mentally incapacitated warmonger bigot president. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=302.22s)]
*  Ironically, because everything is irony, the Wilson Center is itself a major producer of, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=307.82s)]
*  yes, disinformation, but of the neocon variety and for that reason is heavily funded by the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=313.06s)]
*  Biden administration. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  Jankiewicz is also, because everything is connected, a former advisor to the neoliberal [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=318.98s)]
*  government of Ukraine, the government we're shipping tens of billions of tax dollars to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=323.5s)]
*  as our own economy swirls down the drain. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=327.26000000000005s)]
*  So you really can't make any of this up. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=329.86s)]
*  It's too grotesque. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=332.06s)]
*  Would you believe a novel with this plot? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=333.06s)]
*  No, you wouldn't, but it's happening and that's the bad news. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=334.5s)]
*  The good news is everyone involved in Joe Biden's new Ministry of Information is a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=337.74s)]
*  buffoon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=343.06s)]
*  They may be evil, but they're also ridiculous. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=344.66s)]
*  Nina Jankiewicz is the most ridiculous of all. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=347.66s)]
*  So you read about her appointment in the Washington Post this morning and you immediately thought [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=350.66s)]
*  of the NKVD because why wouldn't you? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  Even the NKVD, even at the height of Stalin's purges, never did karaoke. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  They were too dignified for that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=361.54s)]
*  But Nina Jankiewicz happily does. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=363.58000000000004s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=365.74s)]
*  Information laundering is really quite ferocious. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=368.74s)]
*  It's when a hockster takes some lies and makes them sound precocious. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=371.1s)]
*  By saying them in Congress or a mainstream outlet so. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=374.1s)]
*  Disinformation's origins are slightly less atrocious. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=377.3s)]
*  It's how you hide a little, little, little lie. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=382.3s)]
*  It's how you hide a little, little, little lie. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  It's how you hide a little, little, little lie. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=385.78s)]
*  When Rudy Giuliani shared that intel from Ukraine. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=386.78s)]
*  Or when TikTok influencers say COVID can cause pain. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=389.78s)]
*  They're laundering disinfo when we really should take note. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=392.78s)]
*  And not support their lies with our wallet, voice or vote. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=395.78s)]
*  Oh! [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=398.78s)]
*  So this is the point of the show we're going to say we're kidding, we're making all of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=399.78s)]
*  this up. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=402.78s)]
*  It's not really happening in the country you were born in, but it is happening. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=403.78s)]
*  That's now a law enforcement official. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=406.46s)]
*  It's also the person you just saw, an individual who brags about getting a master's degree [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=408.9s)]
*  from Georgetown University. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=413.78s)]
*  In case you're wondering if the entire academic credentialing machine that sustains America's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=414.78s)]
*  ruling class is in fact a joke. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  Spoiler alert, yes it is a joke. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=421.34s)]
*  This is somebody with so few useful skills that she describes herself in the first words [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=423.3s)]
*  of her own bio as a quote, internationally recognized expert on disinformation. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  As if that's a job of some sort. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=434.65999999999997s)]
*  Imagine if one of your kids grew up to be an internationally recognized expert on disinformation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=436.97999999999996s)]
*  The shame you would feel. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=442.5s)]
*  The pain of knowing that truly and unequivocally you had failed as a parent. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=443.94s)]
*  After all those years of advanced education Nina Jankiewicz became an internationally [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=449.7s)]
*  recognized expert on disinformation. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=453.38s)]
*  And not only that, she can't even rhyme very well. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=455.4s)]
*  What Nina Jankiewicz can do, her one skill, the purpose for which she was hired, is level [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=459.88s)]
*  partisan attacks on the other side with maximum ferocity. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=464.62s)]
*  That is her real job. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=468.06s)]
*  Now you may have noticed if you listen carefully to the Diddy DeShieta saying that every example [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  of disinformation in her karaoke performance came from people who opposed Joe Biden's policies. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=473.74s)]
*  Is that a coincidence? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=482.62s)]
*  In fact we know it's not because Nina Jankiewicz is telling all the disinformation is on the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=484.53999999999996s)]
*  other side of the political divide. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=490.14s)]
*  Listen. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=492.74s)]
*  Most of the disinformation that we've seen, this highly emotionally manipulative content [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=493.74s)]
*  is coming from the right. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=499.06s)]
*  If you look at the top ten most engaged with posts on Facebook or Twitter on a given day, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  they are usually posts that are coming from the right. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=506.18s)]
*  And that's because the right does deal in this highly emotional rhetoric. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=508.90000000000003s)]
*  You'd have to live in a self-awareness free vacuum. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=513.94s)]
*  You might even have to go to Georgetown University to utter a sentence like that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=519.7s)]
*  The right deals in this highly emotional rhetoric. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=523.26s)]
*  This is Nina Jankiewicz. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=527.86s)]
*  Now it's worth noting here, because we can't resist, that this very same Nina Jankiewicz [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=530.14s)]
*  once wrote an entire book about how women can't use the internet because it's just too [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=533.98s)]
*  upsetting for them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=537.74s)]
*  They're too fragile to read words they disagree with. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=538.74s)]
*  It makes them faint. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=541.38s)]
*  Here's a direct quote from Nina Jankiewicz's book. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=542.94s)]
*  Quote, to be a woman online is an inherently dangerous act. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=545.1s)]
*  Keep in mind, if you're a lady and you were to, I don't know, order Uber Eats, you're [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=552.14s)]
*  exposing yourself to danger. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=558.3s)]
*  This is the same woman Nina Jankiewicz telling you that it's the right that uses emotional [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=560.9s)]
*  rhetoric. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=564.8199999999999s)]
*  Now to be fair, Nina Jankiewicz probably didn't expect a lot of people to read that in her [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=565.8199999999999s)]
*  book because no one read her book. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=571.14s)]
*  It has a total of two reviews on Amazon. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=572.86s)]
*  But we did read it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=574.9s)]
*  We'll get in a moment to what we found because it tells you exactly what we can expect from [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=576.22s)]
*  under Nina Jankiewicz. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=580.96s)]
*  But first it's necessary to know a little more about this person. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  Now she's not simply a hypocrite. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  She obviously is, whether she knows it or not. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=588.6s)]
*  She would be too dim to understand hypocrisy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=590.48s)]
*  What she really is, of course, is a heavy for the Democratic Party and she's done that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=593.36s)]
*  job flawlessly. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=596.9200000000001s)]
*  Nina Jankiewicz, the disinformation hunter, once called the Hunter Biden laptop story, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  which is entirely true, a quote, Trump campaign product. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  In October of 2020, she wrote, quote, voters deserve the context, not a fairy tale about [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=609.2s)]
*  a laptop repair shop. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=614.44s)]
*  Now did she give us the context or any countervailing facts? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=616.76s)]
*  Did she deliver the truth about the story? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=619.6s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=621.4000000000001s)]
*  She just read a bunch of lies somebody handed to her on a card because she's a useful idiot. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=623.22s)]
*  And now she's a law enforcement official. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=627.0600000000001s)]
*  Nina Jankiewicz is repeating a lie that was, of course, widespread on the eve of the presidential [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  election. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=634.72s)]
*  And once she repeated it, it made it possible for Joe Biden to repeat it on the debate stage [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=636.16s)]
*  during a presidential debate. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  In case you've forgotten, here he is. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what this he's accusing [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  me of is a Russian plan. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=650.12s)]
*  They have said that this has all the care, four, five former heads of the CIA, both parties [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=652.88s)]
*  say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=659.4s)]
*  Nobody believes it except them. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=662.4s)]
*  His and his good friend Rudy Giuliani. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=666.68s)]
*  That's exactly what exactly what it's called. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=670.88s)]
*  Just to be clear, this is a nightmare unfolding in slow motion. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=676.92s)]
*  But this is the point where we're just going to have to draw the line. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=681.3199999999999s)]
*  No Joe Biden, you can't have a federally funded Ministry of Truth. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  And no, Nina Jankiewicz can't run it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=689.1600000000001s)]
*  Period. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=691.84s)]
*  It's not your country, you're not even Kampus Menis, and you don't get to do this to a free [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  people. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=697.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=698.0s)]
*  This can't happen. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=699.0s)]
*  And what is this? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=701.72s)]
*  Well, if you want to know what's going to happen, look at what just did happen. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=702.72s)]
*  So Nina Jankiewicz made it possible for a presidential candidate to lie from the debate [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  stage about a story that may have changed the outcome of election. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=711.48s)]
*  Our election, our presidential election, speaking of disinformation, she never apologized [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=716.04s)]
*  for that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=720.12s)]
*  That's because her role has nothing to do with the truth or stopping disinformation. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=721.36s)]
*  Her job is to restrict any speech that challenges Joe Biden or the Democratic Party. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=725.7199999999999s)]
*  Now, you'd think that would be illegal in this country as a federal employee because [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=730.92s)]
*  we do have a First Amendment. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=736.0s)]
*  But Nina Jankiewicz doesn't believe in the First Amendment. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=738.02s)]
*  As she wrote recently, quote, the free speech versus censorship framing is a false dichotomy. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=740.8s)]
*  First of all, here's a pro tip. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  Anyone who uses the term false dichotomy is a moron. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=749.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  That is one of countless academic phrases designed to prevent thought rather than facilitate [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=758.64s)]
*  False dichotomy means they're never going to have to explain why their position is correct [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=759.64s)]
*  or yours is wrong. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=763.64s)]
*  That is dismissed with, oh, it's a false dichotomy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=764.64s)]
*  Again, that's an NPR phrase used by low IQ people who for some reason run our country [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=766.8399999999999s)]
*  all of a sudden. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=771.4799999999999s)]
*  False dichotomy. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=772.88s)]
*  Here's what's not false at all. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=774.5999999999999s)]
*  Government censorship is banned by the First Amendment, the First Amendment to the Bill [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=775.9599999999999s)]
*  of Rights. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=778.4799999999999s)]
*  This whole country is predicated on that. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=779.4799999999999s)]
*  But according to Joe Biden's new Minister of Truth, the First Amendment no longer applies [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=781.5999999999999s)]
*  in this country because Russia and systemic racism, watch. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=787.24s)]
*  It's clear that actors like Russia are using those internal fissures, things like our systemic [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=792.88s)]
*  racism here in the United States, things like economic inequality, to amplify these issues [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=798.14s)]
*  and really make us distrust the system. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=804.36s)]
*  So we reached out to DHS, the law enforcement agency now in charge of policing speech about [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=808.28s)]
*  Nina Jankiewicz and her plans to censor you from saying what you think is true. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=812.32s)]
*  And they assured us that they weren't going to do that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=815.88s)]
*  They're going to focus on human smuggling and Russia propaganda on Ukraine. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=817.88s)]
*  First of all, it's not their job to decide what you learn about the border or Russia [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=821.68s)]
*  or Ukraine. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=825.04s)]
*  It's your job. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=826.04s)]
*  You're an adult. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=827.04s)]
*  You can read whatever you want. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=828.04s)]
*  But of course, it's not about that anyway. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=829.36s)]
*  If you read Jankiewicz's book, which we did, you will realize very quickly she was hired [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=830.76s)]
*  to police domestic social media use, period. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=834.36s)]
*  Quote, I have hope we can change the norms by which our online ecosystem is governed, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=836.76s)]
*  she wrote, in a typically illiterate sentence. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=841.54s)]
*  This is what our colleges are producing. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=844.04s)]
*  Morons. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=845.68s)]
*  You can't even write English. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=846.68s)]
*  Later in the book, she encourages women to go to law enforcement if they see something [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=847.68s)]
*  online they don't like on Twitter. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=851.64s)]
*  She called that, quote, an important step in the denormalization of women's treatment [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=853.0s)]
*  online. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  It's hard even to believe our system produces people like this. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  She's an illiterate fascist. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=860.2s)]
*  In another book, Jankiewicz made it clear that she's not in favor of government regulation [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=862.52s)]
*  of social media when it allows conservatives to speak freely. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=865.8000000000001s)]
*  So she devotes an entire chapter to criticizing the country of Poland for establishing its [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=869.72s)]
*  own Ministry of Digital Affairs. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  Polish officials said their ministry was a way to, quote, deal with rampant online censorship [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=875.1600000000001s)]
*  of conservatives on social networks. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=879.12s)]
*  But she's against that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=881.24s)]
*  She's against the anti-censorship program. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=882.24s)]
*  She's for censorship. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=884.16s)]
*  She wrote that Poland was making a big mistake in pulling back censorship. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=885.88s)]
*  And we're quoting. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=890.64s)]
*  Poland's nearsightedness is leaving it extremely vulnerable, she wrote. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=891.64s)]
*  And the solution, she wrote back, is for the U.S. government to, quote, lead in regulating [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=895.72s)]
*  and conducting oversight of people who disagree with the Democratic Party on Twitter. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=900.16s)]
*  So the truth was never the goal. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=905.58s)]
*  And we're quoting again. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=907.9200000000001s)]
*  We are not even sure that facts can prevail over disinformation, Jankiewicz wrote. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=909.64s)]
*  We must first begin with addressing social media. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=913.54s)]
*  And just to be totally clear, the means of the distribution of information are the key [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=915.52s)]
*  to their rule. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=920.9s)]
*  It's all they have. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=922.04s)]
*  They have nothing but that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=923.04s)]
*  If you knew what was actually going on, you wouldn't put up with this for a second. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=924.68s)]
*  And they know that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  And the Biden administration knew that Jankiewicz wrote all of this. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  That's why they hired her. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=933.8s)]
*  What you're seeing is a full-scale attack on free speech in a country that has been [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=935.8s)]
*  free for nearly 250 years and is happening at the direction of the U.S. government through [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=939.9599999999999s)]
*  a law enforcement agency. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=944.28s)]
*  We can reveal that Biden's Pentagon, another group with guns, awarded a $750,000 contract [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=946.52s)]
*  to a group called NewsGuard. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  Now that contract is for misinformation fingerprints. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=954.4399999999999s)]
*  NewsGuard is an organization that claims to fight, quote, misinformation, but in practice [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=957.8399999999999s)]
*  is a censorship organization. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=963.04s)]
*  It targets anyone who challenges the people in power. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=964.32s)]
*  NewsGuard is currently preparing a blacklist of sites that contradict the national security [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=967.32s)]
*  state's talking points on Ukraine and Russia. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=971.2s)]
*  So this week, NewsGuard wrote a threatening email to the news site Grayzone informing [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=973.72s)]
*  the Grayzone that they're spreading, quote, disinformation because they're not reading [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=978.2s)]
*  the script. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=982.08s)]
*  So here's how the editor of the Grayzone, Max Blumenthal, responded. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=983.12s)]
*  He wrote this. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=985.96s)]
*  Do you seriously expect us to grovel for approval from the same tentacle of the national security [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=986.96s)]
*  state and financial oligarchy that has rated CNN as a highly credible news source and [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=991.36s)]
*  whose board of advisors is a grotesque gallery of corporate propagandists, spooks, documented [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=996.44s)]
*  liars, war criminals who have never faced a scintilla of accountability for their actions? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=1001.52s)]
*  Kind of overheated language, is it true? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=1006.84s)]
*  Yeah, every word of it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=1009.24s)]
*  So when Joe Biden's censors come, that's the way you respond. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=1011.28s)]
*  Hey pal, up yours. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=1014.8000000000001s)]
*  You want some disinformation? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=1016.12s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=1017.52s)]
*  You are a free person in a free country and no law enforcement agency can ever tell you [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=1018.88s)]
*  what to think or say, period. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4inJSblCUY&t=1024.44s)]
