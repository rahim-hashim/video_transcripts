# Tucker Carlson: Does this make you nervous?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, if you're watching this right now, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=2.4s)]
*  you are missing a rare prime time address from Joe Biden. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=4.12s)]
*  Biden doesn't give a lot of those for obvious reasons, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=8.2s)]
*  but tonight's topic is worthy of the occasion. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=10.8s)]
*  America, ladies and gentlemen, is under attack [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=13.06s)]
*  and not from our usual enemies. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  The threat we face tonight is existential, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=17.76s)]
*  but it's not coming from barefoot religious extremists [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=20.2s)]
*  living in caves. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=22.72s)]
*  It's not the Chinese government, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=24.28s)]
*  it's not even Vladimir Putin himself, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=25.8s)]
*  the most diabolically evil man in history. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=28.22s)]
*  No, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=31.18s)]
*  this threat is worse than all of that and it's homegrown. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  As they say in the horror movies, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=35.68s)]
*  it's coming from inside the house. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=36.9s)]
*  The single gravest threat to America today [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=38.98s)]
*  is Republican voters, all 75 million of them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=42.18s)]
*  They are Nazis and destroyers of democracy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=46.5s)]
*  They must be stopped. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=49.26s)]
*  That is the message of Joe Biden's speech. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=50.82s)]
*  Just moments ago, he referred to MAGA forces [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=52.66s)]
*  for apparently marshaling at Red Lobster near you, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=55.1s)]
*  ready to take over this country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=58.260000000000005s)]
*  Now to underscore how deeply Joe Biden means all of this, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  tonight's address in Philadelphia [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=63.7s)]
*  is not being categorized as a campaign event [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=65.38s)]
*  ahead of the midterm elections, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=68.0s)]
*  which is what it looks like, no. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=69.14s)]
*  Instead, this speech has the full sponsorship [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=70.86s)]
*  of the White House. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  In other words, what Joe Biden is saying right now [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=74.78s)]
*  is the official position of the entire executive branch [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=77.22s)]
*  of the US government. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=79.98s)]
*  That would include the Justice Department, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=81.3s)]
*  the various intel agencies, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  and the world's most powerful standing military. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=84.84s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=87.4s)]
*  Does it make you nervous? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=88.76s)]
*  You don't have to be a Trump voter [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=90.78s)]
*  to see a speech like this as a turning point [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=92.44s)]
*  in American history. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=94.76s)]
*  For hundreds of years, the US has had a political system [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=96.4s)]
*  comprised of two competing parties. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=99.08s)]
*  If you were to declare one of those parties criminal [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=102.04s)]
*  and illegitimate, what would you be left with? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=104.94s)]
*  Well, you'd be left with a one-party state, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=108.28s)]
*  and that is what Joe Biden is calling for tonight, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=110.64s)]
*  a one-party state. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=112.64s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=114.84s)]
*  You may have trouble believing it's even happening, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=115.84s)]
*  and yet it is live on television right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=117.8s)]
*  And yet, and here's what we're here to tell you, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=120.72s)]
*  believe it or not, there is an upside to this catastrophe. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=122.32s)]
*  Even as you watch your beloved country [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=125.84s)]
*  take a turn you never imagined possible, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=127.8s)]
*  there is reason for hope. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=129.94s)]
*  American liberals may have obvious dictatorial ambitions. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=133.0s)]
*  There's no question they do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  Only would-be dictators fear free speech [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  and an armed population. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=140.48s)]
*  But just because liberals long for a one-party state [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=142.46s)]
*  doesn't mean they're going to get one. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=145.34s)]
*  They won't. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=147.78s)]
*  In the end, they don't have the skills to pull that off. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=148.74s)]
*  Liberals are too incompetent to overthrow democracy, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=151.22s)]
*  and that's obvious from history. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=154.58s)]
*  Every successful authoritarian revolution [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=156.38s)]
*  has had two things in common, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=158.34s)]
*  a coherent worldview and a competent military force. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=160.02s)]
*  Lenin, for example, Lenin had the writings of Karl Marx [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  to provide an ideological justification for his revolution, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=167.46s)]
*  and he had the military genius of Leon Trotsky [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=170.38s)]
*  to pull it off. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=173.18s)]
*  Together, these two things were enough to topple the Tsar [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=174.34s)]
*  and take control of the world's biggest country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=177.42s)]
*  For all his power, Joe Biden does not have these two things. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=180.38s)]
*  Marx and Trotsky, no. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden has Taylor Lorenz and Mark Milley. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=185.82s)]
*  Lorenz is the ideological anchor of the Biden White House. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=189.26s)]
*  She's its muse, its Che Guevara. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=193.06s)]
*  They are inspired by her revolutionary fervor. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=194.96s)]
*  But Taylor Lorenz does not write weighty books. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=198.16s)]
*  Twitter is her canvas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=201.88s)]
*  And having surveyed her oeuvre, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  we can tell you that Lorenz's main idea appears to be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=206.12s)]
*  that anyone who doesn't wear an N95 mask in the shower [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=208.84s)]
*  is a racist. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=212.44s)]
*  That's the sum total of her ideology. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, there are probably several dozen people in Cambridge [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=215.96s)]
*  who agree with that, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=218.0s)]
*  but it is hardly the basis of a popular movement. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=219.16s)]
*  It's not Marxism, it's whining. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  So that's a problem for Biden. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=224.66s)]
*  And then there's Mark Milley, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=226.2s)]
*  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=227.16s)]
*  Milley is Joe Biden's Leon Trotsky, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=229.0s)]
*  but without the brilliance or the cool mustache. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Mark Milley is a buffoon. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=233.44s)]
*  He couldn't even manage to successfully withdraw forces [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=234.96s)]
*  from a country that wanted them to leave. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=237.28s)]
*  Mark Milley's only victories take place at lunch. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=239.9s)]
*  Pizza is afraid of him. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=242.9s)]
*  No one else is. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=244.44s)]
*  So these are the people who are trying to bring us [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=246.16s)]
*  a one-party state. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=248.4s)]
*  For the next several minutes, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=250.44s)]
*  we'd like to show you the face of Joe Biden's revolution. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=251.48s)]
*  It is heartening. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  The next time you feel afraid [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=255.8s)]
*  for the future of this country, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  the next time you think, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  these people actually want to hurt me [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  because obviously they do, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=260.94s)]
*  remember who we're talking about here [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=263.32s)]
*  and you'll feel better. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=264.72s)]
*  Now we're gonna start tonight [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=266.12s)]
*  with Joe Biden's minister of information, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=266.94s)]
*  a person called Corrine Jean-Pierre. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre may be the most self-discrediting [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=271.32s)]
*  spokesman in the history of revolutionary politics. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=273.68s)]
*  She makes Baghdad Bob from the Saddam years look dignified. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=276.56s)]
*  She's literally beyond belief. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=280.0s)]
*  Here she was on Monday. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=282.76s)]
*  Somebody unvaccinated comes over on a plane. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=284.88s)]
*  You say that's not okay. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  Somebody walks into Texas or Arizona unvaccinated, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=289.76s)]
*  they're allowed to stay. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=293.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  But that's not how it works. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=295.68s)]
*  Like we actually, no. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=296.8s)]
*  I know that that's not what you guys want to happen, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  but that is what is happening. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=299.92s)]
*  But that's not, it's not like somebody walks over [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=301.24s)]
*  and that's not how. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=303.56s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=305.36s)]
*  We. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=307.16s)]
*  Thousands of people are walking in a day. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  Some of them turn themselves over. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  Some of them are caught. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=312.92s)]
*  Tens of thousands a week are not. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=314.28s)]
*  That is what is happening. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=316.36s)]
*  It's not like someone just walks over the border. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=319.52s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre laughs at that idea and waves her hand. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=322.0s)]
*  So there are two options to explain what's going on here. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=326.36s)]
*  Either Corrine Jean-Pierre doesn't have a television set [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=328.4s)]
*  and has no idea what's happening in America right now. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=331.76s)]
*  That's entirely possible. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=334.36s)]
*  Or we think this is more likely, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=336.24s)]
*  she has seen the tape, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=338.28s)]
*  but just doesn't recognize what it is. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=339.92s)]
*  She cannot discern people just walking over the border [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=342.32s)]
*  when she sees pictures of people [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=345.4s)]
*  just walking over the border. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=346.92s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=349.4s)]
*  She is that stupid. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=350.24s)]
*  Want another example? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=351.88s)]
*  Well, here she is, apparently with total sincerity, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=353.56s)]
*  assessing a recent speech [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  by Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=357.4s)]
*  And just last week, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=360.36s)]
*  you had Governor Ron DeSantis suggested that Dr. Fauci [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=361.48s)]
*  should be physically assaulted. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=365.52s)]
*  And former President Trump has done the same [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=368.4s)]
*  many, many times. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=371.08s)]
*  Whoa, she looks concerned. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=374.84s)]
*  And frankly, so are we. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  What do you think of Ron DeSantis? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=378.24s)]
*  If he's calling for Dr. Fauci to be physically assaulted, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=379.44s)]
*  that cannot stand. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  That is bad. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=383.24s)]
*  That's violence. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=384.08s)]
*  But of course the question is, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  and it's always the question with Corrine Jean-Pierre, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  is did that actually happen? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=389.79999999999995s)]
*  Thankfully we have the tape. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=391.52s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=392.76s)]
*  You have people like Fauci saying [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=394.32s)]
*  that his lockdowns didn't cause any permanent damage [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  to any young kids. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=399.68s)]
*  And I'm just sick of seeing him. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=401.16s)]
*  I know he says he's gonna retire. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=402.44s)]
*  Someone needs to grab that little elf [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=404.32s)]
*  and chuck him across the Potomac. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  There it is. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=411.16s)]
*  Someone needs to grab that little elf [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=412.0s)]
*  and chuck him across the Potomac. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=413.8s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre was horrified by this. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=416.24s)]
*  Elf chucking? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  That's not even legal. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  Not since the early days of the Howard Stern Show [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=421.24s)]
*  has this nation put up with elf chucking. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=423.56s)]
*  And by the way, who is Ron DeSantis [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=427.92s)]
*  that he can physically throw a federal employee [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=429.84s)]
*  all the way across the Potomac River, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=432.24s)]
*  which is very wide in parts? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=433.88s)]
*  And Corrine Jean-Pierre knows that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  because she lives there. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  Was he Hercules or something? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=438.8s)]
*  This man is dangerous. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=440.08s)]
*  Chucking an elf across the Potomac? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=441.92s)]
*  And not only that, DeSantis just outed Tony Fauci [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=446.44s)]
*  as an elf. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=449.2s)]
*  Elf, that's the word he used. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=450.32s)]
*  Not an approved word. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=451.64s)]
*  That's a threat to national security. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=453.08s)]
*  It is indeed disinformation, probably Russian. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=454.4s)]
*  Everyone knows that Tony Fauci is very tall. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=457.52s)]
*  That's science. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=460.28s)]
*  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is Corrine Jean-Pierre. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  So of all the jobs you could hire Corrine Jean-Pierre [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=467.2s)]
*  for, a professional hand waver would be probably the first. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=470.2s)]
*  If you need someone to wave a hand and look confused, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  she's at the top of your list. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=475.88s)]
*  But if you need someone who can speak English [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=477.84s)]
*  in a fluent way and communicate ideas [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=479.4s)]
*  that the rest of us are able to understand, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=481.32s)]
*  she might be at the very bottom of your list. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=483.0s)]
*  But they hired her anyway. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=487.04s)]
*  And the result is amazing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=488.8s)]
*  And as we said earlier, heartening. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=490.44s)]
*  These are the leaders of the revolution. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=492.48s)]
*  Today, for example, Corrine Jean-Pierre [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=494.12s)]
*  defined the term extremist for us. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=496.20000000000005s)]
*  You never hear that ever defined. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=498.36s)]
*  But she defined it today from the podium. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=500.76000000000005s)]
*  An extremist is anyone whose views differ from, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=502.48s)]
*  we're quoting, the majority of Americans. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=505.12s)]
*  So if your views are different from the majority, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  you're an extremist. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=509.68s)]
*  So here's the best part. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=511.44s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre works for a guy [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=513.08s)]
*  who's got a 38% approval rating. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=515.6s)]
*  So the question before the class today [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  is 38% less or more than the majority. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  Math is not Corrine Jean-Pierre's strong suit. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=526.24s)]
*  And of course, it's not her boss's strong suit either. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=530.4000000000001s)]
*  Cognition is not his strong suit. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  This is the man who took orders [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=535.96s)]
*  for men in Easter bunny costumes. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=538.08s)]
*  This is the man who chose as his vice president, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=541.56s)]
*  someone who feels the need to say mankind and womankind [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=544.8s)]
*  as if they're completely separate categories. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=551.04s)]
*  The Artemis program is the beginning of the next era [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=552.56s)]
*  of what we have a history and a tradition of doing, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=556.5999999999999s)]
*  of providing vision and inspiring innovation [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=559.8s)]
*  in a way that is gonna benefit all mankind and womankind. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=564.2399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so not only is it gonna benefit mankind, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=568.8s)]
*  you gotta include the ladies here, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=571.88s)]
*  womankind will benefit as well. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  Transkind, that goes without saying. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=576.52s)]
*  Transkind always benefits when Joe Biden's president. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=579.92s)]
*  So you have to wonder how different things might look [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  if they had people with an IQ of over say 85 [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=587.92s)]
*  in positions of authority in the Biden White House. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=591.16s)]
*  That would be really, really scary, but they don't. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=592.92s)]
*  They don't at all. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=596.0s)]
*  And if they had people serving them in the media [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=597.76s)]
*  who were smarter, they could probably get away [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=602.76s)]
*  with this kind of thing. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=605.4799999999999s)]
*  They could convince people it's totally normal [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  to use words like womankind. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  That would be terrifying if our media, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  if MSNBC were able to convince you [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=614.1999999999999s)]
*  that womankind was a thing. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=616.0s)]
*  But thank heaven, the media as annoying as they may be, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  lack self-awareness to the point that we don't have [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  to worry at all. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=625.92s)]
*  And to prove it, we have a dispatch [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=627.44s)]
*  from one of Joe Biden's most fervent supporters, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=629.8s)]
*  someone who will definitely have a position [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=632.48s)]
*  in the coming revolution, and that would be Max Boot. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=635.6s)]
*  Max Boot of the Washington Post, professional warmonger [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=638.84s)]
*  turned liberal, professional warmonger. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=642.0s)]
*  He just wrote a piece about how the real America [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=644.16s)]
*  is actually the most liberal America. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=648.08s)]
*  We're just gonna quote from the piece and let you assess. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=651.0s)]
*  And keep in mind, this is part of the Biden brain trust. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=652.6800000000001s)]
*  I've been spending time in some of the most liberal enclaves [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=655.5999999999999s)]
*  in America. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=658.36s)]
*  First, Martha's Vineyard, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  where former President Barack Obama has a house, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  bit of a bragger, Max Boot. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=663.5999999999999s)]
*  And then going back to the quote, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=665.12s)]
*  Provenstown mass, an LGBTQ Mecca [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=666.76s)]
*  where pride flags are ubiquitous. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=670.7199999999999s)]
*  What did Max Boot do in Provincetown? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=672.92s)]
*  We're not gonna pry, we're merely quoting from the piece. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=674.56s)]
*  And here it is, I even took my stepkids to a drag show. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  So there's one sentence that kind of sums up [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=682.2s)]
*  the NPR revolution we're living through. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=686.8s)]
*  And we're gonna say it again. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=688.72s)]
*  I took my stepkids to a drag show. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=690.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, the stepkids were not interviewed [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=693.24s)]
*  about their perceptions of the drag show, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=695.24s)]
*  but I took my stepkids to a drag show [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=697.32s)]
*  has got to be the greatest boast of all time. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=699.32s)]
*  Can you say that? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=702.24s)]
*  Have you taken your stepkids to a drag show? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=703.08s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=705.72s)]
*  But you know what Max Boot discovered [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=707.8s)]
*  from taking his stepkids to a drag show? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=709.12s)]
*  And we're quoting, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=710.64s)]
*  Provincetown is the real America. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=711.48s)]
*  So is Martha's Vineyard. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=714.36s)]
*  In fact, he said, we're still going [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  because we can't stop ourselves. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=718.8s)]
*  And of course he can't stop himself. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=720.24s)]
*  And we're quoting, they might be more representative [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=721.56s)]
*  of 2022 America than the Rust Belt Diners [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=724.12s)]
*  where reporters love to take the pulse of Trump-landia. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=726.84s)]
*  They're not taking their stepkids to drag shows [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=733.28s)]
*  at the Rust Belt Diners, I'll tell you that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=735.36s)]
*  But they will when we're done with them. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=738.4s)]
*  They're probably not gonna get there. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=741.28s)]
*  Max Boot is gonna be too distracted. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=743.28s)]
*  Well, there are drag shows every weekend. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=745.12s)]
*  You can take your stepkids to drag shows [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=746.8000000000001s)]
*  all over the country. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=748.88s)]
*  So he's not gonna have time to affect this revolution. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=750.76s)]
*  It was pretty therapeutic reading all of this. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=753.96s)]
*  All you have to do is pay close attention to them. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=756.52s)]
*  Listen to what they say, read what they write [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=759.64s)]
*  and a calm comes over you. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=762.6s)]
*  They're so dumb, they probably can't hurt you. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=764.84s)]
*  We can't stop ourselves. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=768.84s)]
*  Here's another example. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  He's finally calling out Republican semi-fascist behavior. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=772.88s)]
*  Where has this version of Joe Biden been hiding all along? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=776.88s)]
*  Was his semi-fascism label, in your opinion, unfounded? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  The Republican party of today under Donald Trump [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  is a semi-fascist party. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=790.2s)]
*  President Biden did the right thing. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=792.48s)]
*  He did the right thing by challenging them [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=793.72s)]
*  and calling them a mega-fascist, semi-fascist mentality. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=796.08s)]
*  What do you think about the president [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=801.8000000000001s)]
*  calling millions of Americans semi-fascist? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=803.12s)]
*  Listen, he's gotta express and be honest [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=808.72s)]
*  about what he feels in his heart and his soul. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=810.36s)]
*  And now he's out saying two things. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=812.9200000000001s)]
*  One, lots of y'all are fascists. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=815.44s)]
*  And by the way, if you vote Republican, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=817.6400000000001s)]
*  there's a decent chance that our democracy [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  is no longer gonna exist. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  I gotta tell you, Scott, a lot of folks would go, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=823.5600000000001s)]
*  where's the lie? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=825.32s)]
*  I don't see it, no lie is detected. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=826.4s)]
*  Saying semi-fascist leads me only to the question, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=828.28s)]
*  what's semi about that? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=832.88s)]
*  It's full-on fascism. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  That's the brain trash, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=839.4s)]
*  Why only semi-fascist? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=841.52s)]
*  Why not full fascist? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=843.12s)]
*  And what's the difference, Joe Scarborough? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=844.32s)]
*  Talk to us more about criminal behavior. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=846.88s)]
*  Talk to us more about criminal behavior. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=848.8s)]
*  You'll find it really reassuring. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  But the point, of course, is that journalism [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=852.5999999999999s)]
*  is when you repeat what the people in power say verbatim [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  and then you congratulate them for their insight. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=860.92s)]
*  So how does the rest of the world see this? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=864.8399999999999s)]
*  Now we play these clips all the time and they're annoying. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=866.76s)]
*  But if you were taking a cold, calculated look [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=871.0s)]
*  at the people in charge of the United States, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  if you were a foreign adversary and you're thinking, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  what are we up against? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=877.44s)]
*  What would you make of this? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=879.72s)]
*  Imagine being in the Taliban two years ago, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=881.1600000000001s)]
*  you're a Taliban commander and you happen to flip on MSNBC [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=886.2s)]
*  and you think to yourself, this is America's news media? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=890.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=893.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, my native language is Urdu [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=895.72s)]
*  and even I can tell these people are freaking stupid. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=897.6s)]
*  But their secretary of state must be impressive, right? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=901.1600000000001s)]
*  He's the secretary of state, let's check on YouTube [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=903.24s)]
*  and here's what you find. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  ["Bad Women's Song"] [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=907.6800000000001s)]
*  Imagine being the Taliban with their turbines [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=933.5600000000001s)]
*  and their AKs and Tony Blinken starts wagging his finger [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=936.28s)]
*  at them, you must release the hostages or else. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=938.88s)]
*  Or else what, pal? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=942.64s)]
*  Well, it turns out nothing. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=944.1999999999999s)]
*  Taliban gets to keep our tanks and our helicopters [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=946.12s)]
*  and Tony Blinken goes back to performing Hoochie Coochie Man. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=948.8399999999999s)]
*  Did he take his step-kid to the drag show this weekend? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=952.04s)]
*  Probably, they all did. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=954.52s)]
*  We should tell you that all of these people on MSNBC [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=957.6s)]
*  and at the State Department officially [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=960.4399999999999s)]
*  or not work for Joe Biden. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  So the dumbness may flow downhill [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=963.72s)]
*  like certain other fluid matters. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=965.96s)]
*  Joe Biden doesn't even appear to realize that his military, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=969.84s)]

*  In fact, it was just this week [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=979.24s)]
*  that Joe Biden claimed very loudly [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  that Americans would need personal F-15s [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  if they wanted to overpower the US government. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=985.36s)]

*  And he made that argument with such confidence, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1001.12s)]
*  you have to wonder if anyone told him [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1002.96s)]
*  what happened in Kabul, let's look back, oh, last year. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1004.96s)]
*  He also doesn't appear to realize [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1008.96s)]
*  that he's accusing unarmed January 6 protesters [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1010.3199999999999s)]
*  of nearly toppling American democracy for good. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1013.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1016.96s)]
*  If you're afraid of Ashley Babbitt, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1018.36s)]
*  so afraid you have to shoot her in the neck and murder her, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1019.92s)]
*  then you probably don't feel very secure. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1024.48s)]
*  So these are not people who believe they're strong, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  is the truth. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1030.44s)]
*  And watching this, it's kind of fascinating, actually. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1031.28s)]
*  And on some level, it's reassuring, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1035.68s)]
*  because again, they're weak and afraid. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1037.92s)]
*  Our plus-sized defense secretary promises to crack down [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1041.12s)]
*  on Joe Biden's political opponents, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  oh, extremism, white supremacy, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1045.4s)]
*  then he flies around the world in a space suit, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1047.32s)]
*  and then he gets COVID anyway. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1050.8s)]
*  And to show you how strong he is [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1054.1999999999998s)]
*  and to strike terror in the hearts of our adversaries, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1055.9199999999998s)]
*  he's issuing powerful new regulations [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1058.4799999999998s)]
*  requiring senior leaders in the military [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1060.9599999999998s)]
*  to stop using gendered pronouns. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1062.8s)]
*  Well, that'll show them we've got diversity, back off. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1065.0s)]
*  So you can no longer use the terms he or she [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1069.0s)]
*  or male or female. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1071.1599999999999s)]
*  According to the Washington Free Beacon, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1072.52s)]
*  which got the military's order, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  the US Pacific Air Forces, responsible for containing China, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1076.0s)]
*  believed that eliminating gender pronouns [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1080.0s)]
*  in the military is, quote, lethality. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1082.12s)]
*  Diversity is lethality. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1086.32s)]
*  Now, of course, on one level, it's terrifying, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1089.4399999999998s)]
*  because no, this is a sign of buffoonery and weakness, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1091.36s)]
*  and the rest of the world is laughing at us [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1094.72s)]
*  and making calculations accordingly. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1096.12s)]
*  But it's probably good news for you [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1097.6799999999998s)]
*  as the subject of Joe Biden's coming crackdown, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1099.52s)]
*  because when they come to arrest you [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1101.8799999999999s)]
*  for your thought crimes, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1103.08s)]
*  they're gonna have no idea what you look like. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1104.8s)]
*  The warrant won't say. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1107.1999999999998s)]
*  It'll identify you as they, them, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1109.36s)]
*  or maybe, zhi zhur. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1111.44s)]
*  You can imagine the confusion. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1114.28s)]
*  At that point, it's easy to get out of it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1115.92s)]
*  You simply identify with a straight face [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1117.68s)]
*  as pansexual, two-spirit, and indigenous, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1119.64s)]
*  and at that point, they will slink away in shame. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1122.56s)]
*  You're safe. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1125.1200000000001s)]
*  Diversity was your shield. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1126.6000000000001s)]
*  But the best news of all, for all of us in this country, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1129.3200000000002s)]
*  is that Lori Lightfoot inevitably will occupy [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1132.1200000000001s)]
*  some elevated position in Joe Biden's coming revolution. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1135.6000000000001s)]
*  How do we know? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  Because she's the single worst mayor in the country. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1139.42s)]
*  She's stupid, she's mean, she's openly racist. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1140.64s)]
*  So of course, she is due for a big promotion [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1143.2s)]
*  in the Biden regime. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1146.0s)]
*  Now you might remember that when the previous administration [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1148.0s)]
*  started enforcing federal immigration law, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1150.16s)]
*  Lori Lightfoot cut off ICE's access to city databases. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1152.16s)]
*  Quote, Chicago will always be a welcoming city [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1156.2s)]
*  and a champion for the rights of our immigrant [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1159.2s)]
*  and refugee communities. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1161.2s)]
*  Communities that didn't actually live here at the time, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1163.48s)]
*  they lived in other countries, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1165.0s)]
*  because they're foreign nationals, they're not Americans. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1166.6000000000001s)]
*  But Lori Lightfoot took a position anyway, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1170.0s)]
*  and she took it in the most affirmative possible way. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1172.6000000000001s)]
*  To behave differently, she insisted at the time, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1176.68s)]
*  and we're quoting, would be cruel. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1178.8400000000001s)]
*  And you know what the word is, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1181.24s)]
*  you know what's coming, don't you? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1182.08s)]
*  Racist. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1183.3600000000001s)]
*  Well this week, the governor of Texas decided [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  to test Lori Lightfoot's commitment to anti-racism. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1187.16s)]
*  He began transporting illegal aliens from the border [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1190.88s)]
*  in Texas all the way to Chicago. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1194.08s)]
*  And why wouldn't he do that? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1196.58s)]
*  Lori Lightfoot has said emphatically, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1197.42s)]
*  she wants them in her city. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1198.96s)]
*  She's not a racist, you're the racist. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1200.32s)]
*  So these migrants showed up. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1203.56s)]
*  How did Lori Lightfoot respond? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1204.68s)]
*  Well, Lori Lightfoot's administration declared [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1206.64s)]
*  that this plan is, do you know the answer? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  Can you guess? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1212.6000000000001s)]
*  Pick up the pen, write it down, no cheating. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1213.92s)]
*  Racist. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1217.2s)]
*  So it's racist not to want illegal aliens in your city, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1218.6000000000001s)]
*  and it's racist when people send them. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1221.64s)]
*  So take three steps back, what's happening here? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1223.92s)]
*  This is really a recruitment experience. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1226.04s)]
*  No one in the history of politics has created [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1229.32s)]
*  single-handedly more right-wingers than Lori Lightfoot. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1232.82s)]
*  Imagine her in her new position in the Biden administration [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1236.52s)]
*  screaming on NPR every morning, Biden's state broadcaster, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1239.0s)]
*  to tell you whether she's decided whether you can use [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1242.6s)]
*  your electric car today or not. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1244.72s)]
*  Can we drive our electric car today? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1248.32s)]
*  I don't know, let's tune in to Minister Lightfoot, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1250.26s)]
*  she'll tell us. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  Everyone knows that's coming. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1254.24s)]
*  And if there's anything that will provoke [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1256.1599999999999s)]
*  a counter revolution, it's that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1257.28s)]
*  So we're gonna be fine. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1259.7199999999998s)]
*  Lori Lightfoot may have genocidal impulses, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1261.3s)]
*  she definitely does, but like the rest of our leaders, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1263.1599999999999s)]
*  she is too stupid to pull them off. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOkK24fJvk&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
