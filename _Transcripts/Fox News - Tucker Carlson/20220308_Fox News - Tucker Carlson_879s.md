# Tucker: You are about to get a lot poorer
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight you may have noticed that Joe Biden announced today [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=2.12s)]
*  a new front in his ongoing war [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  against America's middle class. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=6.8s)]
*  Biden didn't frame it that way, of course. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=8.96s)]
*  Democrats rarely say what they mean. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  They tell you it's about something else. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=12.68s)]
*  In this case, Biden told us it was about Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=14.52s)]
*  Biden explained that we're going to hurt Putin [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=17.46s)]
*  by making it illegal for Americans to buy Russian energy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=19.68s)]
*  This, he said, will amount to a massive moral victory for us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=23.0s)]
*  We're gonna feel great about ourselves. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=26.68s)]
*  And at the same time, it will be a crushing defeat [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=28.36s)]
*  for the Russians, who of course deserve it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  So it was one of those rare occasions [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=33.12s)]
*  when we could see the good guys win and the bad guys lose. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=34.8s)]
*  Hooray. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=38.599999999999994s)]
*  Around Washington, you could almost hear [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=40.04s)]
*  the feverish applause as Biden finished speaking. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=41.68s)]
*  Every constituency loved it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=44.72s)]
*  The media agreed that Joe Biden [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=47.44s)]
*  had never seen more presidential. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=48.64s)]
*  Democratic officials seemed deeply relieved. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=50.84s)]
*  For once, they could talk about something [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=52.8s)]
*  other than COVID in the southern border. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=54.04s)]
*  They'd rather be on offense than defense. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=55.76s)]
*  Republican leaders, meanwhile, seemed happiest of all. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=58.12s)]
*  They barked like seals. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=61.28s)]
*  Finally, a chance to sound tough and decisive [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=63.08s)]
*  without making CNN angry. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Joe Biden. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  We can all be John McCain now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=69.52s)]
*  You rarely see unity like this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=72.32s)]
*  in a city as divided as Washington. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=74.12s)]
*  The unity was so heady, in fact, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  so delightful and intoxicating [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=78.0s)]
*  that no one remembered to ask the most basic question. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=80.2s)]
*  Why exactly are we doing this? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=83.4s)]
*  What's the point? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=85.2s)]
*  Is the point to bankrupt Vladimir Putin? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=86.84s)]
*  That might be worth doing, but this won't do it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=89.16s)]
*  Putin already has ready markets around the world [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=92.2s)]
*  for his oil, starting in China, in India, in Turkey. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  So that's not gonna work. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=97.2s)]
*  Maybe the point is to force Russian troops [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=98.84s)]
*  to withdraw from Ukraine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  That would definitely be worth doing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=102.12s)]
*  But no, that's not the point either. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=104.4s)]
*  Joe Biden will typically say absolutely anything, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=107.16s)]
*  but even Joe Biden didn't claim today [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=109.36s)]
*  that sanctioning Russian oil will end the war in Ukraine, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=111.12s)]
*  because it won't. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  So who exactly are these sanctions aimed at? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=116.44s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=119.8s)]
*  If you want to identify the target of a penalty, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  consider who's gonna suffer most from it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=123.64s)]
*  And in this case, the answer could not be clear. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  It's middle-income Americans. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=128.4s)]
*  They're the ones who were crushed [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=130.26s)]
*  for two years under COVID restrictions. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=131.52s)]
*  They're the ones who are about to be pummeled [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=133.72s)]
*  by shutting down more energy sources. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=135.36s)]
*  Notice a theme here? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=137.6s)]
*  The people in charge hate the middle class above all. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=138.88s)]
*  So it's not Vladimir Putin who's getting punished. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=141.86s)]
*  It's American citizens. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=144.68s)]
*  It's you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=146.26s)]
*  That's not speculation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=147.14s)]
*  Gas prices are already the highest [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=148.56s)]
*  they have ever been in history, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  and they're about to get even higher, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  potentially much, much higher. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=153.2s)]
*  So the price of natural gas, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  and the price of electricity, and food, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=156.28s)]
*  and everything else you buy that has to be transported [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  more than 100 yards from where it was made, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=160.38s)]
*  which is to say every single thing in your life. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=162.82s)]
*  This is not good news for you, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=167.04s)]
*  no matter what Washington is currently claiming. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  You are about to get a lot poorer, that's guaranteed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=171.26s)]
*  You'll notice as you watch this clip [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=174.62s)]
*  that that is the one thing that somehow [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=176.1s)]
*  Joe Biden forgot to mention today. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=178.18s)]
*  Today I'm announcing the United States [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=180.7s)]
*  is targeting the main artery of Russia's economy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=182.82s)]
*  We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=186.26s)]
*  That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=190.84s)]
*  at U.S. ports, and the American people [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=193.1s)]
*  will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=194.86s)]
*  It's simply not true that my administration or policies [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=199.22s)]
*  are holding back domestic energy production. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=202.3s)]
*  It's simply not true. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=205.7s)]
*  So lying by omission is pretty simple. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  You just don't mention the truth. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=211.54s)]
*  You heard Biden do that just there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=213.46s)]
*  But it takes something else very different, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=214.98s)]
*  whether it's chutzpah or delusion or senility [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=216.98s)]
*  or whatever else explains Joe Biden's behavior. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=219.01999999999998s)]
*  It takes something like that to tell a lie [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=221.54s)]
*  like the one you just heard at the end of Biden's statement. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=223.42s)]
*  It's simply not true that my administration or policies [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=226.62s)]
*  are holding back domestic energy production. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=229.14s)]
*  Oh, but it simply is true. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=231.94s)]
*  It's demonstrably true, and everyone knows it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=233.76s)]
*  On his first day in office, Biden single-handedly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  killed the Keystone XL pipeline. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=238.04s)]
*  Then just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, weirdly, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=240.2s)]
*  Biden's administration shut down all new energy leases [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=244.0s)]
*  and permits on federal land. That happened. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  Vladimir Putin did not do that. Joe Biden did it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  Watch Biden's publicists try to explain [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=252.48s)]
*  that actually preventing domestic energy production, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=254.44s)]
*  which they have done, is very different [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=257.68s)]
*  from holding back domestic energy production. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=259.68s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=263.32s)]
*  Let me give you the facts here, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=264.92s)]
*  and I know that can be inconvenient, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=266.28s)]
*  but I think they're important in this moment. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=267.64s)]
*  To the contrary, we have been clear [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  that in the short-term supply, we must keep up with the demand. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=272.56s)]
*  We are, and here and around the world, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=275.56s)]
*  will we make the shift to a secure, clear, clean energy future. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=277.24s)]
*  We are one of the largest producers [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=280.44s)]
*  with a strong domestic oil and gas industry. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  We have actually produced more oil. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=285.28s)]
*  It is at record numbers, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=287.28s)]
*  and we will continue to produce more oil. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=288.88s)]
*  There are 9,000 approved drilling permits [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=291.36s)]
*  that are not being used. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  So the suggestion that we are not allowing companies [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=296.24s)]
*  to drill is inaccurate. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=299.64s)]
*  The suggestion that that is what is hindering [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=301.44s)]
*  or preventing gas prices to come down is inaccurate. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=304.88s)]
*  Let me give you the facts here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=309.16s)]
*  Now, when they say that, you know the lies are coming, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  and indeed, in this case, they arrived promptly. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=313.76s)]
*  Because oil companies have not used [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=316.64s)]
*  all the permits they've received, Gensaki told us, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=318.68s)]
*  that means this is their fault. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=321.88s)]
*  They're not trying hard enough to produce energy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=323.84s)]
*  They could, but they don't want to. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  But wait a second, Gensaki. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=327.88s)]
*  What if there's no oil or gas underneath the permitted land? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  In that case, energy producers would want permits [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=335.32s)]
*  for land where the energy is. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  Turns out they don't want dry wells. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=340.44s)]
*  They want wells that flow, but they're not getting them, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  thanks to the Green New Deal lobby [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=345.32s)]
*  that completely controls this administration. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=347.28s)]
*  They can't get those permits. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's what's happening here. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=351.32s)]
*  And if you doubt it, ask anyone [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=352.96s)]
*  who works in the energy business. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=354.32s)]
*  Gensaki just lied to you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  They are all lying to you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  You probably guessed that already, but you can't say it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  Because if you wonder what these policies may be doing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=364.28s)]
*  to your country or to your family, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=366.44s)]
*  you are selfish and disloyal. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=368.84s)]
*  In fact, you're unpatriotic, because real patriotism [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  is caring about Ukraine first. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, caring about Ukraine [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=375.12s)]
*  means prolonging a bloody war on Ukraine [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=377.32s)]
*  until the entire country of Ukraine has been destroyed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=379.88s)]
*  and millions of Ukrainians are refugees. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  We know we can do it because we did it in Iraq. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=385.32s)]
*  We can do it in Ukraine. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=387.32s)]
*  That's patriotism. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  Once you spell it out, it all sounds kind of complicated. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=390.52s)]
*  So we're going to hand it over to our late-night moral leader, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  Stephen Colbert, to explain. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=395.44s)]
*  Today, the average gas price in America [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=397.96s)]
*  hit an all-time record high of over $4 per gallon. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=400.44s)]
*  Okay, that stings, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=404.12s)]
*  but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm willing to pay... [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  CHEERING AND APPLAUSE [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=410.88s)]
*  It's important. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=415.16s)]
*  It's important. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=416.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=418.12s)]
*  Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=419.8s)]
*  because I drive a Tesla. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, it turns out a guy who makes $16 million a year [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  is willing to pay a little more for gas, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=429.04s)]
*  if that's the right thing to do. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=431.76s)]
*  He's willing to make that sacrifice, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=433.24s)]
*  because that's the kind of caring, decent man Stephen Colbert is. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=436.24s)]
*  Now, what's true is, you just heard, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=440.12s)]
*  that he doesn't actually use gasoline. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=441.48s)]
*  He drives a $150,000 electric car. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=443.0s)]
*  But he will do it anyway. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=445.88s)]
*  He's the kind of man who will take you out to dinner [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  and let you pay. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=449.72s)]
*  And at the end, he'll let you leave a big tip, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=451.36s)]
*  because he cares about the server. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=454.0s)]
*  Sometimes, as Stephen Colbert reminds us, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=456.24s)]
*  life is about making tough moral choices. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's especially true now. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=460.88s)]
*  If at the end of this project, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=462.84s)]
*  this protracted exercise in social reorganization [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=464.4s)]
*  achieved through COVID plus the war with Russia, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=466.84s)]
*  if at that point, whenever it is, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=469.23999999999995s)]
*  we no longer have a self-sufficient middle class, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=471.23999999999995s)]
*  if people who make under a hundred grand a year [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  are more desperate and demoralized [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=475.76s)]
*  and dependent on government than they've ever been, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=477.56s)]
*  if the only Americans who remain truly free at that point [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=479.76s)]
*  are the oligarchs, well, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  at least we can say we helped democracy. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  When Mark Zuckerberg controls everything in America, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=487.12s)]
*  you will know it's a truly democratic system. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=489.32s)]
*  But the question Trudeau understands is, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=492.68s)]
*  he ran over members of his middle class with horses, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=494.44s)]
*  because that's what it took to preserve democracy in Canada. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=497.32s)]
*  And then he went farther. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=500.44s)]
*  He seized truckers' bank accounts, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=501.44s)]
*  and then he shut down a coffee shop [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  that served people who didn't vote for him. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=504.68s)]
*  That's what democracy looks like. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=506.96s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren was excited [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=509.36s)]
*  when she saw this kind of democracy at work. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=510.44s)]
*  Warren knows if we're gonna preserve democracy in America, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=512.68s)]
*  if we're gonna fight Russia, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=515.12s)]
*  then Elizabeth Warren is going to need fingertip control [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=516.72s)]
*  of your family's finances now and always. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=519.24s)]
*  Don't try and hide anything from Elizabeth Warren, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=521.44s)]
*  say in cryptocurrency, because if you do, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=523.6400000000001s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren will know [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=526.72s)]
*  you are working for Vladimir Putin. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=528.2800000000001s)]
*  As I mentioned earlier, we're going after two things, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=530.2800000000001s)]
*  trying to squeeze the Russian economy [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=532.32s)]
*  and also trying to squeeze those oligarchs, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=534.36s)]
*  The problem is we're doing that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  only through the formal banking system. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=540.2s)]
*  And we're doing a good job on that, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  and that is very effective. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  It's historic, I'm 100% behind it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=546.2s)]
*  But there's a hole in the dike here, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  and the hole is crypto. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=552.36s)]
*  In other words, you gotta pick it, crypto. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=554.1999999999999s)]
*  If you wanna continue to trade [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=557.6s)]
*  and provide the trading platforms and so on in the wallets, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=560.8s)]
*  you can do business in Russia [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=564.48s)]
*  or you can do business in the United States, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=565.64s)]
*  but you can't do business in both. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  Here's an idea. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=571.4s)]
*  Let's keep dumb people and crazed partisan demagogues [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  away from our financial system and our power grid. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=576.76s)]
*  They can keep the sociology department, have fun, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=579.96s)]
*  but why don't you stay away from the fundamentals [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=583.6s)]
*  that keep the country running? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=585.44s)]
*  How's that sound? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=587.12s)]
*  That was the arrangement for decades, but no longer. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=587.96s)]
*  You must submit to total personal control [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=591.8000000000001s)]
*  by your responsible lunatics like Elizabeth Warren, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  or you can serve Russia, as she put it, quote, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=597.64s)]
*  you can't do business in both. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=600.36s)]
*  And by the way, you better not complain about this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=603.4s)]
*  Good Americans love higher gas prices. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=604.8s)]
*  They love suffering for a cause they don't understand. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=607.3599999999999s)]
*  CNN looked into it and that's what they found. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=609.92s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=611.92s)]
*  People we've spoken to over the last couple of weeks, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=613.28s)]
*  they're okay paying higher prices [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=615.8s)]
*  if it means holding Russia accountable [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=618.24s)]
*  for what they are doing in Ukraine, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  but these prices are likely gonna creep higher. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=622.92s)]
*  Turns out Americans are delighted to be poor and helpless. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=627.12s)]
*  They love it because poverty means [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=630.5999999999999s)]
*  holding Russia accountable. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=632.52s)]
*  Not Putin's poverty, that's not gonna happen, your poverty. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=634.48s)]
*  Well, how exactly does your poverty hold Putin accountable? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=638.68s)]
*  CNN didn't ask that question, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=641.68s)]
*  but the polling company Rasmussen did ask, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  that's what they do, they asked this question, quote, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=645.68s)]
*  if a wider war breaks out in Europe, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=647.68s)]
*  should the US military be involved? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  Pretty simple question. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=650.96s)]
*  The answer was not simple though. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=652.0s)]
*  The answer varied by income. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=653.64s)]
*  This may not surprise you. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  The people who actually fight our wars, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=657.48s)]
*  the people making under 30 grand a year, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=659.48s)]
*  were overwhelmingly opposed to this war. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=661.52s)]
*  Only 37% of them supported military action. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=664.52s)]
*  And then it changed going up. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=668.96s)]
*  The richer and more cut off from physical reality people got, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=670.4s)]
*  the more ardently they supported war with Russia. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  And it turns out that's the subset you see. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=677.04s)]
*  Those are the people on television, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=679.28s)]
*  the people with fake jobs and inherited money. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  They're totally for it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=682.72s)]
*  And they're for it because they're gonna pay no cost, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=684.12s)]
*  but they'll still get to feel virtuous about promoting it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=685.6800000000001s)]
*  Then they'll tune into Stephen Colbert at night [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=689.44s)]
*  with a clean heart. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  As for the Americans who will do the actual fighting [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=693.0s)]
*  and then the suffering here at home, they don't count. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=695.16s)]
*  Because in a democracy, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=698.0s)]
*  you can safely ignore the middle-class. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=699.0799999999999s)]
*  And so our leaders are doing that. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=701.52s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=702.92s)]
*  But the truth is, we should be thinking about the fact [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=704.24s)]
*  that when Americans fill up their cars, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=707.4s)]
*  that they should think about sticking it to poop. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=712.64s)]
*  When they put that gas panel [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=715.24s)]
*  in your gas tank, it's gonna cost them more. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=719.6s)]
*  And part of it's gonna be because of Russia. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  And just stick it to poop. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=726.72s)]
*  Now, here in America, we gotta be ready for the fact [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=728.52s)]
*  that will drive up oil prices, that will drive up gas prices. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=731.12s)]
*  And if we are really standing with Ukraine, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=734.32s)]
*  we have to be prepared to absorb that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  Ban all Russian imports into the United States [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=738.84s)]
*  in terms of oil and gas. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=741.88s)]
*  4% of our oil supply comes from Russia. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=743.76s)]
*  We can easily make that up. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=746.36s)]
*  So what we haven't done yet [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=747.76s)]
*  is go after the oil and gas sector in Russia. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=749.72s)]
*  That's the Achilles' heel to Putin's war machine. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=752.24s)]
*  They don't care about you at all. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=757.12s)]
*  They have complete contempt for you and your interests. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  Notice they don't even bother to apologize to you [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=761.0s)]
*  for what they're about to do to you and your family, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  which will change your life. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=766.84s)]
*  We're not overstating it. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=767.96s)]
*  Now, who are they? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=769.0s)]
*  The first two men you saw in that montage were Democrats. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=770.16s)]
*  The third was Lindsey Graham. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=772.4s)]
*  We'll let you decide what he is, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=773.36s)]
*  apart from utterly loathsome, obviously. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=775.0s)]
*  But we have to tell you [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=777.88s)]
*  that virtually every elected Republican in Washington, D.C. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=779.4399999999999s)]
*  is fully on board with this, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=783.72s)]
*  which is another way of saying they are totally committed [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=785.96s)]
*  to screwing their own supposed constituency, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=789.0s)]
*  which would be America's shrinking, desperate middle class. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=792.2s)]
*  Those are the people who vote Republican. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=794.92s)]
*  And this is what they get in return. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=796.96s)]
*  No apology, shafted. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=799.96s)]
*  It's hard to remember a betrayal at this scale. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  And yes, we have been here before, by the way. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=805.76s)]
*  We've been in conflicts with Russia for a long time. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=808.2s)]
*  The United States traded with the Russians [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=810.92s)]
*  through the height of the Cold War, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=812.64s)]
*  when the Soviet Union and the United States [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=814.6s)]
*  had nuclear weapons pointed right at each other, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=816.52s)]
*  and we worried one might go off. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=818.4399999999999s)]
*  We traded with Joseph Stalin in the middle of his terror. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=820.36s)]
*  At the very moment he was murdering 4 million, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=823.24s)]
*  yes, Ukrainians. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=825.36s)]
*  That happened. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=828.4399999999999s)]
*  And then we armed Stalin. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=829.72s)]
*  We armed the Soviet army as he was killing Ukrainians. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=831.28s)]
*  And the New York Times endorsed all of it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=835.16s)]
*  But now, because Putin invaded Ukraine, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  effectively encouraged by the Biden administration [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=840.36s)]
*  to do that, which is true, because that happened, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=842.6s)]
*  we are going to send billions of dollars [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  to the Saudi theocracy, and then to the Iranians, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=848.4399999999999s)]
*  and then to Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=851.4s)]
*  And at the same time, we're going to embrace green energy, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=853.28s)]
*  which means giving the government of China [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=855.92s)]
*  complete control over a power grid here in America. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=857.28s)]
*  That's our plan. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=859.8399999999999s)]
*  Are you confused by it? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=861.0799999999999s)]
*  Don't be. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=862.6s)]
*  It's a moral victory. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=863.48s)]
*  Let us know when you get tired of winning. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r26dUDdNQo&t=864.96s)]
