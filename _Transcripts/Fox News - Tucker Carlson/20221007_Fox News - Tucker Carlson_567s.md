# Ye: This is when my connection with Obama 'faded'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI)
*  Do you talk to Obama still? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=0.0s)]
*  I was Obama's favorite artist. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=3.24s)]
*  He actually met with me. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=4.88s)]
*  Obama met with me and my mama to say that he was running for office back in 2008 and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=6.28s)]
*  that he wanted the support. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=15.44s)]
*  And everybody was so into this idea of the black president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=16.44s)]
*  And we were always, you were always cool. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=23.6s)]
*  And it's also like, you know, how many of us are there? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=27.98s)]
*  You know, Obama level, Ye level, you know, Virgil level, just black, you know, so brilliant [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=36.58s)]
*  that we cut through all of the lines of racism. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=48.5s)]
*  Like, you just can't get rid of us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=52.1s)]
*  King Cole level, Dave Chappelle level. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=54.86s)]
*  So in some place we'd have to be friends and get along because it's like, you know, you're [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=59.54s)]
*  at that level. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=66.3s)]
*  You're like a, you know, Formula One Lewis Hamilton race car driver. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=67.42s)]
*  We're still driving a white car, but we're the best race car drivers that ever existed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  And that was, that was me and Obama's connection. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=81.1s)]
*  But soon as I wasn't saying the things that I was supposed to say as a rapper, our connection [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=84.98s)]
*  faded. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  So you don't talk to him anymore? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  I'll talk to him if I see him. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=96.66s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=98.3s)]
*  But I guarantee you he see me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=99.3s)]
*  I didn't even know that man. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=103.18s)]
*  I just thought that sounded cool. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=104.18s)]
*  One idea that was in my head about three minutes ago that I really want to say is that's really [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=109.04s)]
*  interesting about the, when companies get the BLM managers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=116.28s)]
*  What's a BLM manager? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=124.2s)]
*  Black Lives Matter office manager. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  It's basically you get a semi-influential black person to become the face of a white [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=132.56s)]
*  company. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=137.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=138.84s)]
*  So that means like in the design world, in the art world, they actually would pick artists [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=139.84s)]
*  that were less talented than other artists based on their influence, not based on their [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=146.96s)]
*  actual work, because everyone is vying for influence and an opinion. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=154.16s)]
*  Everyone is afraid of losing their opinion. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=162.4s)]
*  So with Nike, Nike is as famous as, you say Nike is more famous than PayPal, right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=166.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=176.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=177.72s)]
*  What number company do you think PayPal is? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=178.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Number four. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=181.88s)]
*  Overall? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=182.88s)]
*  Overall. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=183.88s)]
*  You know what the number one is, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=184.88s)]
*  It's Apple. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=187.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=188.72s)]
*  Number two, but number three is McDonald's. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=189.72s)]
*  Then SpaceX is maybe six or seven. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=194.56s)]
*  It's really interesting that as lit as Elon is, his previous company is actually still [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=199.28s)]
*  worth more than SpaceX. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=205.28s)]
*  So what number company do you think Nike is? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=208.8s)]
*  The Nike. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  Number 321. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=216.24s)]
*  It's not there to be as big a financial company as it can be. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=218.48s)]
*  It's there as an influencer because black people love Nike. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=226.04s)]
*  So Nike is like a company that is redlining and gerrymandering black people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=232.76s)]
*  Why Gap wanted me to go to Gap, it wasn't based on, oh, we need to get our stocks up. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=243.02s)]
*  You know, it's like these companies, when they've been around for a long time, Gap's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=251.74s)]
*  not like, they're like, we're in the rag trade. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=255.9s)]
*  We're never going to be Apple. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=258.54s)]
*  And everyone, all of these American companies somehow took this deal where they start putting [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=260.94s)]
*  in these really awkward, weird number kind of CEOs. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=265.64s)]
*  Nike's got one. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=270.82s)]
*  The Gap had one. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=274.46s)]
*  It didn't work out. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  And there's all of these weird operators inside of companies, even in Balenciaga. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  The and they're just there for control. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  Steve Jobs talked about it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=293.58s)]
*  It's the most important thing you can have is control. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=295.41999999999996s)]
*  Look at me, all the money, all the influence, and I have to act a complete ass to have [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=299.3s)]
*  any say so of anything that my children are doing because that group of people have control [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=306.3s)]
*  and say so over all the children inside of the clan. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=316.38s)]
*  So that's what these companies are set up for. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=321.66s)]
*  That's the type of CEOs they're hiring, especially when the founders are out of there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=325.94s)]
*  They kind of just give the companies up to a bunch of people and they're all in cahoots. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=329.26s)]
*  Like anyone that ever worked with me, they just look at, oh, who's yay farming for talent [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=335.53999999999996s)]
*  that we can hire to be our new BLM office manager? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=341.74s)]
*  Like kind of like Obama. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  You think of Obama as a BLM office manager? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=352.94s)]
*  Best whenever. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=357.42s)]
*  Best whenever. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=360.1s)]
*  And you know, I think Obama, just like Virgil, these people were truly black to their core [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=361.1s)]
*  and truly brilliant to their core. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=368.98s)]
*  But they went into situations thinking that they could do it the white way as a black [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=373.98s)]
*  man. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=382.70000000000005s)]
*  We saw what color Obama's hair was when he went in and we saw what color it was when [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=385.42s)]
*  he went out. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=390.18s)]
*  You know, Virgil lost all his hair, you know, and eventually passed away. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=392.3s)]
*  So when I have techniques that are revolutionary, if I raise my voice, if I express myself on [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=398.26s)]
*  Instagram, it's a colonic. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  And people can say, oh, that this is what you're doing is toxic. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=410.5s)]
*  If what I'm saying is toxic, I got to do everything to get it out of my body. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=416.34s)]
*  And there'll be times where I see a level of like oppression, Parisian proper, like [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=424.58s)]
*  next level, you know, France owns 80% of African banks level colonization oppression. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=431.78s)]
*  And I'll be like, I'm not going to let you guys kill me. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=440.1s)]
*  But one thing that has to really happen, say if Trump ran, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=444.94s)]
*  We're not just going to be black influence. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  We're going to be vision and creativity. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=457.58000000000004s)]
*  We've got to rethink who we are as a species. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=462.46000000000004s)]
*  Right now, we practice killing ourselves every day. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=465.58s)]
*  Like murder is legal in America, you know, in abortion. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=470.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=477.86s)]
*  So whoever gets the position needs to listen to the vision. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=479.82s)]
*  I didn't know it was going to rhyme when I first started. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=489.53999999999996s)]
*  They need to have Elon. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=492.06s)]
*  They need to have me. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=495.26s)]
*  You should start with those two and then we'll get to the rest of them. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=499.5s)]
*  We could pull in a Johnny Ives, we'll pull in all of our living super brilliant people. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=502.21999999999997s)]
*  And we need to analyze and not just sell out for the cash. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=508.26s)]
*  Like these Fortune 500 companies, they're just selling out for the cash and put God [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=515.62s)]
*  first and the best representation of God as a children. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=519.48s)]
*  The children as an extension of the family, put the families first. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=524.22s)]
*  There's so many things, suburbs, the train tracks being ripped up by GM just for capitalism. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=526.82s)]
*  All these ideas that we have, we're now living in a place where we're the orphans of capitalism [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=533.9s)]
*  and we just have to take a pause and rethink how we can have the most beautiful existence [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=540.14s)]
*  possible for our children, for the kids. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=549.02s)]
*  And we're all kids. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=552.14s)]
*  We're all God's kids. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=553.26s)]
*  We're all sons of Abraham. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSfYDzpjqI&t=554.26s)]
