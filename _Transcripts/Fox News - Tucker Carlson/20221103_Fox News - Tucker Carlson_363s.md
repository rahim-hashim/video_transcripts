# Thermal drone captures hundreds of migrants crossing border illegally
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo)
*  One of the reasons it looks like the people who currently run the government are about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=0.0s)]
*  to be repudiated in a historic way next Tuesday is that they have completely opened our southern [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=6.36s)]
*  border over which more than 5 million foreign nationals have come in and broken our laws [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  by doing it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=18.76s)]
*  The situation on the border is not getting better you'd think it would since there's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=19.76s)]
*  an election coming up. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=22.6s)]
*  It's getting worse. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=23.8s)]
*  Fox's Bill Mollugin knows that firsthand. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=24.8s)]
*  He's in Eagle Pass, Texas for us tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  He has some amazing footage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=29.28s)]
*  Hey Bill. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  Hey Tucker, that's right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=33.24s)]
*  The illegal crossing is down here in the Eagle Pass area just nonstop. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=34.4s)]
*  We had an absolutely enormous group cross illegally this morning and we want to show [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=37.96s)]
*  you this remarkable drone footage our team shot before the sun came up. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=42.02s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  This is our Fox News thermal capable drone showing several hundred migrants crossing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  illegally into Normandy, Texas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Normandy is a tiny little town on the northern outskirts of Eagle Pass and you can see as [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=53.32s)]
*  these illegal immigrants come in they just kind of snake in through the brush right after [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=57.699999999999996s)]
*  they come across the real grand. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  A CBP source telling us as of this morning in just a 24 hour span in this sector there [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=63.18s)]
*  were more than one thousand seven hundred illegal crossings and as you can see from [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=68.17999999999999s)]
*  this video almost all the people coming in are single adults had a chance to talk to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=72.17999999999999s)]
*  a lot of them as they were walking up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=76.14s)]
*  They're mostly from Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua, Uruguay and the Dominican Republic and you [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=77.94s)]
*  see them just walking in this single file line willing to give themselves up and surrender [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  to Border Patrol. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=87.84s)]
*  They're doing that because they know once they step foot in the United States under [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=88.84s)]
*  the Biden administration's policies they are likely just going to be released into the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  United States rather than removed from the country and we had a chance to talk to a lot [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=96.16s)]
*  of these migrants as they were walking up for processing and we asked them a simple [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=100.5s)]
*  question in Spanish. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=104.04s)]
*  Do you believe the border is open or is it closed? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  And everybody who talked to us laughed and smiled and they said, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=108.64s)]
*  It's open, it's open. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=111.56s)]
*  No migrants ever tell us they believe that border is closed as they are crossing it illegally [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=115.2s)]
*  and we see groups like this every single day out here in the Eagle Pass area. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=119.92s)]
*  Just to put it in perspective for you we had a group there in the same spot yesterday and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=124.36s)]
*  yesterday in a one hour span we had more than eight hundred illegal crossings and back out [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=128.16s)]
*  here live a CBP source tells us just since October 1st just in this Del Rio sector there [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=132.84s)]
*  have already been more than forty six thousand illegal crossings and that does not count [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=137.88s)]
*  the thousands of known gotaways. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=141.96s)]
*  Tucker send it back to you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=143.48s)]
*  Greatest crime ever committed against the United States by far nothing ever has come [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=144.96s)]
*  close to what we're seeing now and no one has reported on it more assiduously than you [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=148.76s)]
*  have but I want to show our viewers some of the reporting that you did for our new documentary [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=153.6s)]
*  Battle for the Border which was on Fox Nation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=158.34s)]
*  Here's a clip if you'll stay right there we want to put this up. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=161.68s)]
*  The tens of thousands of illegal aliens coming across every month only make it easier for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=166.04s)]
*  the cartels to smuggle drugs through the Big Ben sector. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=170.88s)]
*  Smugglers love this area because it's so open so remote so easy to hide and not nearly as [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=174.2s)]
*  many border patrol agents looking for them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=179.72s)]
*  Resources are already stretched then customs and border protection in the Texas Department [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=182.56s)]
*  of Public Safety have scattered cameras through the desert to help identify illegal crossers [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  But the technology isn't enough. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  The only way to stop deadly drugs from entering this country is by hunting smugglers in person [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  on the ground in the field. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=200.56s)]
*  So they're on the two track about it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  So we're ahead of them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=203.68s)]
*  Abandoned drug bundles litter the desert floor. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=204.68s)]
*  They've been ditched by smugglers who hear approaching law enforcement helicopters overhead. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=207.28s)]
*  After hiding the drugs smugglers blend in with immigrant groups to get away scot-free. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=212.24s)]
*  Sergeant Morris decided that he wanted to find some drug bundles or dopers as he likes [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  Bill Mollugian joined our team for a mission to recover lost drug bundles with Sergeant Morris. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=222.04s)]
*  We land get down investigate lo and behold we get two bundles weighing approximately [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=226.68s)]
*  100 pounds of marijuana. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=231.04s)]
*  Square shaped look like a worth landing and checking out for sure. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=232.96s)]
*  There it is. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  There it is right there from the air we could see a little square. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  How the hell did you see that from the air? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=240.96s)]
*  You know I guess just doing it for a while your eye gets trained to it and yeah I haven't [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=242.84s)]
*  seen a perfect square rock before so that caught my attention. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=247.38s)]
*  You can tell they spray painted it with a little black kind of camouflage it in. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  So we're looking around right here it looks like there should be another bundle right over here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=254.44s)]
*  When I go through TSA tomorrow these drug dogs are gonna light me up. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=257.84s)]
*  Come up here and. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=261.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=263.2s)]
*  There it is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=264.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=265.2s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=266.2s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=267.2s)]
*  But perfectly intact it's good good condition right here look at that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=269.28s)]
*  So what we're gonna do is we're gonna cut this duct tape off here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=272.88s)]
*  Oh shoot. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=276.24s)]
*  Holy smokes what do we got? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=277.88s)]
*  I mean we've done this story so many times but those pictures are still stunning. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=282.04s)]
*  Bill people who are still two years in living next to this day to day what is their view [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=286.72s)]
*  of the border right now? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=291.8s)]
*  Well they're frustrated because they feel like it's just getting worse and worse and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=295.56s)]
*  the numbers back that up. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  Remember fiscal year 2021 broke the all time record with 1.7 million illegal crossings. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=300.16s)]
*  Then we just broke the record again in fiscal year 2022 with nearly 2.4 million crossings [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=305.56s)]
*  and there has been no action no change in policy from the administration and those numbers [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  don't even count for the known gotaways. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=315.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean we're pushing over 1 million known gotaways since President Biden took office [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=318.52s)]
*  and that is what border patrol agents tell us they are most concerned about. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=322.84s)]
*  It's not these families or these people willing to turn themselves in. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  What happens is when these big groups come across border patrol agents get sucked up [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=328.88s)]
*  having to process them and then you know the bad actors and the drugs are able to slip [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=332.67999999999995s)]
*  in elsewhere along the border. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=336.64s)]
*  Tucker. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  And no one in Washington cares. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  I wish just Sanchez would send another 10,000 of them to Bethesda wake those people up. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=340.4s)]
*  Bill Mollugin great to see you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=345.28s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  Documentary is called Battle for the Border you can stream it right now on Fox Nation [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE0dlC-7Mo&t=347.59999999999997s)]
