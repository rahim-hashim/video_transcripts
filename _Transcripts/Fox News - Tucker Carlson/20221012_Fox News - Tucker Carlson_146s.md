# Harmeet Dhillon: Taylor Lorenz is a 'one-woman wrecking crew'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU)
*  Armeet Dhillon is the CEO and founder of the Center for American Liberty. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=0.0s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=2.96s)]
*  Armeet, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  So tell us what this suit alleges. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=6.48s)]
*  Well, as you mentioned, Tucker, Taylor [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=11.48s)]
*  Lorenz, notorious cry-bully who's jumped around from various publications [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=14.32s)]
*  and is now at The Washington Post, has made her career out of clout chasing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  and increasing her stature by picking victims who happen to be on the upswing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=22.76s)]
*  in the public eye and attacking them viciously, first of all, trying to sidle [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=27.52s)]
*  up to them, making friends with them, and then ultimately, you know, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=31.68s)]
*  gutting them like a fish and then using that for material for her pieces [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=35.04s)]
*  and along the way, violating all kinds of ethical rules and journalism. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=39.52s)]
*  So in this case, she focused on our client, Ariane Jacob, who was running [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=42.6s)]
*  influencer houses and managing talent on TikTok. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=47.28s)]
*  Believe it or not, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=52.84s)]
*  it's a huge industry worth billions of dollars. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  And our client was on the upswing there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  So giving five hours to respond to her [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=59.76s)]
*  hit piece, Questions in Writing, which is her MO and the MO of other [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=63.4s)]
*  dishonest journalists, she was provided with information debunking [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  many of the lies that she published in her story. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=71.72s)]
*  And having written information in hand, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=74.36s)]
*  debunking these lies, she went ahead and published anyway and then [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=76.2s)]
*  followed up on that with posts on social media lying about our client, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=80.68s)]
*  lying about our client's business practices, specific conduct, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=85.2s)]
*  the way these houses were set up and safety and security around them, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=88.84s)]
*  calling our client a bad actor on social media and basically destroying our [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=93.8s)]
*  client's career and causing her damage in the tune of millions of dollars. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, this isn't the first time Taylor Lorenz has done this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=101.68s)]
*  She's also gone on to proceed to try to destroy libs of TikTok. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=104.64s)]
*  I have also a client of my law firm and has even beefed with her coworkers [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=108.72000000000001s)]
*  at the New York Times last week at the Washington Post and other journalists [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=113.48s)]
*  NBC. So this lady is a one woman wrecking crew. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=117.4s)]
*  And I'm hoping that we will finally be the ones to hold her accountable for all [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=120.76s)]
*  the damage she's caused to so many different people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=124.4s)]
*  Tucker. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, she's certainly a bully who I think needs to be restrained. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  And I appreciate you're telling us about this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=130.56s)]
*  Hermit Dillon. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=133.0s)]
*  Great to see you. Thank you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=134.36s)]
*  Catch our nightly opens stories that are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=138.68s)]
*  From Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jHxDdRdrU&t=144.08s)]
