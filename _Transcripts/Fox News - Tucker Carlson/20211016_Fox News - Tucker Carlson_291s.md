# Marine Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller's parents speak out after son's hearing following brig confinement
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw)
*  As far as we know, Lieutenant Colonel Stu Scheller of the United States Marine Corps [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=0.0s)]
*  was the only officer in the entire American armed services who said in public what so [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=7.88s)]
*  many were thinking. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  What the hell are we doing? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  What did our leaders just do in Afghanistan? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  How did they screw it up so badly and why is no one being held accountable? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=15.88s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=18.76s)]
*  And he said it on Facebook. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=19.76s)]
*  Here's part of it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  The reason people are so upset on social media right now is not because the Marine on the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=23.64s)]
*  battlefield let someone down. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=28.84s)]
*  That service member has always rose to the occasion and done extraordinary things. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=31.12s)]
*  People are upset because their senior leaders let them down and none of them are raising [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=35.16s)]
*  their hands and accepting accountability or saying we messed this up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=39.12s)]
*  So instead of answering his questions, the Pentagon did what the Biden administration [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=44.76s)]
*  so often does. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=48.64s)]
*  They punished him. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  They tried to crush him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  They court-martialed him and sent him to jail, to solitary confinement. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  In the end, Stuchelor pleaded guilty to those charges, meaning he's going to lose his retirement [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=55.3s)]
*  benefits. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=59.459999999999994s)]
*  Just before the sentencing phase began today, Stuchelor appeared to be in good spirits. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=64.1s)]
*  What do you expect to happen today? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=65.1s)]
*  We made our case. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=68.1s)]
*  We left it all on the table so we'll see what they do. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=71.1s)]
*  I feel good about everything that I said. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=76.1s)]
*  The man served honorably for 17 years, exactly the kind of person you want protecting your [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=80.82s)]
*  country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=85.58s)]
*  Now he's gone. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=86.58s)]
*  Shortly after that, a judge rejected the prosecutor's request for a stiff sentence. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=87.58s)]
*  He instead issued a reprimand and docked Scheller one month of pay. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=91.46s)]
*  The judge also called for an investigation into possible government misconduct and thank [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=94.66s)]
*  God that he did. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  That misconduct is not possible. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=100.08s)]
*  It's certain. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=101.46s)]
*  Stuchelor Sr. and Kathy Scheller are the parents of Stuchelor and we're happy to have them [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=102.46s)]
*  both on the show tonight. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=106.46s)]
*  Kathy and Stu, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=107.46s)]
*  How is your son doing? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=110.22s)]
*  He's doing well, Tucker. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=112.02s)]
*  Thank you so much for giving us this platform to bring our plight to the American people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=115.14s)]
*  and thank you to the Congress people and most of all, thank you to the Americans that showed [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=120.5s)]
*  up. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=125.22s)]
*  It was the Americans that showed up that spoke their voice, that stood up with our son and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=126.22s)]
*  that's the reason he's not in the brig today waiting for months and months for a court [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=131.62s)]
*  marshal to finally happen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=137.06s)]
*  It was because of your voice. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=138.5s)]
*  We just can't thank you enough and I want to tell you that accountability showed up [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=140.18s)]
*  in that courtroom today in a big way. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  I would like to thank Judge Hines for carefully examining all of the evidence, not taking [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=147.34s)]
*  it out of context, listening to our son's complete and total statement, checking out [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=152.74s)]
*  his military record, recognizing that there was not a single blemish on it until the fatal [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=159.38s)]
*  day of the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and the 13 service members killed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=166.84s)]
*  He recognized it for what it was. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=172.12s)]
*  He gave the lenient sentence and we just cannot thank you, America, enough. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=174.6s)]
*  You see, I have teeth. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=179.16s)]
*  I can smile. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=180.28s)]
*  Well, and we're grateful that he's out, but what a sad day for the country because I think [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=181.28s)]
*  all Americans look at your son, reasonable Americans, and say that's exactly the guy [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=186.94s)]
*  I want as a Marine officer defending us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=190.52s)]
*  I mean, Mr. Scheller, your son spent 17 years in this job. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=192.84s)]
*  It must be poignant for him to have to leave. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=197.8s)]
*  It's not over yet. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=201.12s)]
*  We all think it's over. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=202.12s)]
*  It is not over. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=203.12s)]
*  So here's what you're not going to hear from the Marine Corps spokespeople. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=204.16s)]
*  It's not over. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=209.96s)]
*  The plea deal that Stuart agreed to while in prison was to plead guilty, which by the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=211.56s)]
*  way was always his intent. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=219.28s)]
*  He accepts accountability. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=221.42s)]
*  So he pleaded guilty to the charges. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  He pleaded guilty to the charges and in return, the Marine Corps and the secretary of Navy [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=226.0s)]
*  agreed to accept his resignation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  The only concern we have is that there is no time limit on that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=235.94s)]
*  That could be a week. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=240.06s)]
*  It could be a month. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=241.44s)]
*  It could be months. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=242.7s)]
*  They still have him on a gag order and that's why we're out here talking tonight. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=244.32s)]
*  I tell you what, the final decision maker is the secretary of Navy, Carlos del Toro, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=248.66s)]
*  and he is responsible for signing his resignation and accepting his resignation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=256.9s)]
*  You can Google the secretary of Navy and you can find his address. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=263.14s)]
*  You can find his email address. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=267.86s)]
*  We would like an honorable discharge and we would ask Americans to contact the secretary [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=269.44s)]
*  of Navy and ask him to expedite it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  I don't think there's any doubt that they will and we can only hope that Lloyd Austin [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  will plead guilty and resign his job because he deserves it much more than your son. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=282.98s)]
*  We appreciate it coming on tonight and I'm sure we'll see you again. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=287.06s)]
*  Mr. Misheller, thanks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRpd2NhkWTw&t=289.70000000000005s)]
