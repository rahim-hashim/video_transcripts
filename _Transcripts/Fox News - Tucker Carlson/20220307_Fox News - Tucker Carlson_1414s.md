# Tucker: We are at war with Russia
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=0.0s)]
*  Yesterday morning, Joe Biden's secretary of state, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  a man called Tony Blinken, went on to the Sunday show [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=5.78s)]
*  over at CBS News to announce a new policy toward Russia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=8.58s)]
*  Going forward, Blinken explained, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=12.68s)]
*  the Biden administration will use Poland as a cutout [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=14.38s)]
*  to send fighter jets to the government of Ukraine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=17.5s)]
*  Those jets will be used to fight the Russian military. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=20.3s)]
*  Blinken announced this in a calm, even tone [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  that suggested this was conventional procedure, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=26.22s)]
*  the business as usual, nothing to worry about, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=28.06s)]
*  just on their weekend at the State Department. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=30.08s)]
*  But in fact, it's not typical, it's a very big step. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=32.66s)]
*  It could turn out to be a pivot point in history. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=35.48s)]
*  And for that reason, we want to show you the entire exchange. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=38.4s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=41.4s)]
*  If, for instance, the Polish government, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=42.72s)]
*  a NATO member wants to send fighter jets, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  does that get a green light from the US [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  or are you afraid that that will escalate tension? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  No, that gets a green light. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  In fact, we're talking with our Polish friends right now [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=56.22s)]
*  about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=63.14s)]
*  to the Ukrainians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=66.06s)]
*  What could we do? How can we help to make sure [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=67.78s)]
*  that they get something to backfill the planes [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=69.58s)]
*  that they're handing over to the Ukrainians? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=72.22s)]
*  Are you afraid that will escalate tension, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=75.24s)]
*  asks the script reader, because even a CBS News anchor [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=77.42s)]
*  knows that sending fighter jets to a war usually does that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=80.74s)]
*  No, replies Tony Blinken, that gets a green light. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=84.94s)]
*  It's a remarkable exchange. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=88.66s)]
*  What are we watching here, apart from a conversation [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=90.22s)]
*  between two incredibly shallow people [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=92.62s)]
*  who have limited contact with reality? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=94.5s)]
*  What we're watching is the beginning of a war [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=96.66s)]
*  between the United States and Russia. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=99.42s)]
*  If that sounds jarring, what else would you call it? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=101.94s)]
*  Now, you may support everything that Tony Blinken just said. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=104.62s)]
*  Maybe you do support it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=107.06s)]
*  But let's not lie about what's happening. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=108.74s)]
*  Let's be as honest and clear-eyed as we can be, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=110.7s)]
*  especially now, because it matters. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=112.74s)]
*  The Biden administration just inserted itself with force [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=115.3s)]
*  into the middle of a hot war between two foreign powers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=118.3s)]
*  That means the United States [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=121.86s)]
*  is now an active participant in a war. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  We are at war with Russia. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=126.14s)]
*  Whether or not that war has been officially declared, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=128.78s)]
*  whether or not Congress has authorized that war, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=130.7s)]
*  all of that is irrelevant. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=133.14s)]
*  That war is happening right now as we watch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=135.14s)]
*  Why is no one in Washington saying anything about this? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=138.3s)]
*  Because they support it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=141.34s)]
*  They always have. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=142.54s)]
*  Almost five years ago, way back in 2017, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  Congressman Eric Swalwell of California came on this show [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=146.9s)]
*  for another Russiagate debate, one of many. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=149.82s)]
*  He came to let us know how Vladimir Putin [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=152.06s)]
*  had gotten Donald Trump elected president. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  It was all as stupid as you remember it, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=156.1s)]
*  until the end of the interview, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=158.12s)]
*  when Swalwell said something odd and interesting. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=159.94s)]
*  Swalwell explained that because Putin [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=163.06s)]
*  had installed Donald Trump secretly in the White House, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=164.78s)]
*  the United States should now, quote, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=168.22s)]
*  do everything we can to expand NATO's role. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=171.46s)]
*  In other words, we should let Ukraine join NATO. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  That's odd. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=178.82s)]
*  Why would he say that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  Why would a policy so seemingly obscure NATO, Ukraine? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=181.26000000000002s)]
*  What? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=184.22s)]
*  Why would that be a priority [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=185.18s)]
*  for some forgettable congressman from the East Bay? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=186.74s)]
*  Well, simple. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=190.34s)]
*  Because getting Ukraine to join NATO [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  was the key to inciting war with Russia. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=193.22s)]
*  We didn't get it at the time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=195.22s)]
*  Now it's obvious. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=196.3s)]
*  Vladimir Putin just invaded Ukraine [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=197.54000000000002s)]
*  because he didn't want Ukraine to join NATO. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=199.66000000000003s)]
*  Putin certainly had other motives as well. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  People always do have multiple motives. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=204.46s)]
*  But that's the main reason Russia invaded. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=206.62s)]
*  The Russians don't want American missiles on their border. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=209.86s)]
*  They don't want a hostile government next door. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=212.3s)]
*  Now that's true, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=215.0s)]
*  whether you're allowed to say it in public right now or not. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=216.08s)]
*  It has been true for a long time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=218.28s)]
*  A lot has been written about this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=220.96s)]
*  over many years by serious people. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  No one who knows anything and is honest [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=225.26000000000002s)]
*  will tell you Putin invaded Ukraine [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=227.44s)]
*  simply because he is evil. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=229.12s)]
*  Putin may be evil, he certainly seems to be, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  but he also has strategic motives in doing that, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  whether or not you agree with those motives. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=235.96s)]
*  That's irrelevant. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=237.76s)]
*  Those are the facts. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  So with those facts in mind, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=240.52s)]
*  the Biden administration's behavior [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=242.28s)]
*  in the days before the Ukraine invasion [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  tells you a lot about what motivated them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=246.0s)]
*  With Russian troops massed by the thousands [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=249.08s)]
*  on the Ukrainian border, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=251.46s)]
*  Joe Biden sent Kamala Harris, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=252.84s)]
*  the least capable diplomat in Washington, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=255.18s)]
*  to explain America's policy to European heads of state. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=257.68s)]
*  At a public press event [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=261.08s)]
*  at the Munich Security Conference, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=262.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris encouraged Ukraine [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=263.52s)]
*  to become a member of NATO. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=265.3s)]
*  Quote, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=266.76s)]
*  "'I appreciate and admire President Zelensky's desire [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=267.6s)]
*  to join NATO.'" [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=270.76s)]
*  Message? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=272.36s)]
*  Up yours, Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=273.44s)]
*  Go ahead and invade Ukraine. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=275.04s)]
*  And of course, Vladimir Putin did that just days later. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=277.4s)]
*  So the invasion was no surprise [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  to the Biden administration. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=282.64s)]
*  They knew that would happen. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=283.8s)]
*  That was the point of the exercise. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  We watched all this happen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=288.82s)]
*  We missed it. How? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=290.04s)]
*  Honestly, because it was insane [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=291.94s)]
*  and therefore very hard to take seriously. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=294.24s)]
*  Why in the world would the United States [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=296.6s)]
*  intentionally seek war with Russia? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=298.66s)]
*  How could we possibly benefit from that war? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=301.76s)]
*  We still don't know the answer to that question, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=305.6s)]
*  but it is obvious that permanent Washington [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=307.68s)]
*  has been fixated on war with Russia for a very long time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=309.8s)]
*  A couple of years ago, you may remember, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=313.64s)]
*  we'd forgotten, they impeached a sitting president. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=315.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=318.64s)]
*  For threatening to withhold military aid [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  to President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=321.88s)]
*  Failing to back a proxy war in Ukraine [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=324.56s)]
*  was the one thing Donald Trump [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  was not allowed to do as president. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=328.68s)]
*  Again, they impeached him for it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=330.44s)]
*  And no one said much about it, even in his own party, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=333.28s)]
*  because of course they supported war with Russia too. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=335.96s)]
*  Maybe even more than the Democrats did. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  As far back as 2016, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=341.32s)]
*  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=343.44s)]
*  hysterical little Lindsey Graham, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=344.8s)]
*  was jumping around acting out his war fantasies [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=346.32s)]
*  in front of foreign soldiers in Ukraine. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=349.16s)]
*  If we saw this tape at the time, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=352.44s)]
*  we don't remember seeing it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=353.6s)]
*  Back in 2016, Ukraine seemed like a far away place. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=355.12s)]
*  We should have paid more attention. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=358.08s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=359.76s)]
*  Your fight is our fight. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=361.36s)]
*  2017 will be the year of offense. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  All of us will go back to Washington [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=368.2s)]
*  and we will push the case against Russia. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=371.2s)]
*  Enough of a Russian aggression. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=383.8s)]
*  It is time for them to pay a heavier price. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  Your fight is our fight? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=391.36s)]
*  That's a very strange thing for an American lawmaker [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=393.32s)]
*  to say to a foreign military. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=395.88s)]
*  Why would the Ukrainian government's fight in 2016 [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=398.68s)]
*  possibly be our fight? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=402.12s)]
*  On what grounds is it our fight? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=403.56s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=405.0s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=406.0s)]
*  And yet now it is demonstrably true. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine's fight is our fight. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=409.48s)]
*  Ukraine's war is our war. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  It's here, but most Americans did not see that coming. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=413.2s)]
*  Yet permanent Washington certainly did. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=416.6s)]
*  Permanent Washington understood [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=419.2s)]
*  that the second Vladimir Putin's forces [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=420.52s)]
*  rolled across the border into Ukraine, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=422.6s)]
*  we would inevitably be on a course toward war with Russia. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=424.44s)]
*  They knew. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=428.12s)]
*  Here's the president of the August Council [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=429.32s)]
*  on Foreign Relations on the day of the invasion. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=431.08s)]
*  We need now a responsive necessity to his war of choice. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=434.32s)]
*  And there's gotta be to raise the economic costs at home, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=438.6s)]
*  to raise the military costs on the ground. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=441.72s)]
*  I hate to be so blunt, but the most vulnerable thing [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=444.28s)]
*  that Putin's vulnerable to is dead Russian soldiers. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=447.8s)]
*  So we have to make sure Ukraine has the means [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=451.48s)]
*  to resist. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=454.48s)]
*  Dead Russian soldiers. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=456.2s)]
*  At the time, that seemed a little bellicose, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=458.12s)]
*  right out of the gate, and it just happened. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=459.76s)]
*  Maybe there's some way to deescalate this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=461.76s)]
*  The invasion's terrible, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=463.64s)]
*  but isn't America's role as steward of the West [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=465.6s)]
*  to make things better? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=468.12s)]
*  Wouldn't a prompt Russian withdrawal from Ukraine [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=469.76s)]
*  be the wisest course for everyone, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=472.8s)]
*  including and especially the Ukrainians, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=474.4s)]
*  on whose behalf we claim to speak, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=476.88s)]
*  but whose country would be leveled by a protracted war? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=478.56s)]
*  You would think so, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=482.08s)]
*  but that's not what anyone in Washington wanted. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=482.96s)]
*  They wanted a war, and now they have one. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=484.64s)]
*  So where's this going? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  That's the question for the rest of us [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=488.2s)]
*  who had no role in making these decisions. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=489.4s)]
*  Well, it's worrisome. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=492.08s)]
*  You should keep in mind that the US government [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=493.12s)]
*  is currently run by the same people [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  who planned the Afghanistan withdrawal, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=496.28s)]
*  the ones who tanked the US dollar, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=498.2s)]
*  the people who run Baltimore, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  the ones who tried to send crack pipes to junkies. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=502.08s)]
*  These are people with a long history of destroying things [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=504.12s)]
*  and no history at all of building anything. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=506.96s)]
*  So a lot could go wrong. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=509.24s)]
*  They tell us that Vladimir Putin is unbalanced. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=511.08s)]
*  We'll take that at face value. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=513.24s)]
*  We know that Putin has thousands of nuclear weapons. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=514.36s)]
*  Putin has said that if he is pushed, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=517.24s)]
*  he will use nuclear weapons. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=518.48s)]
*  Could be wise to believe him. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=520.68s)]
*  Harry Kazianis does believe him. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=523.0799999999999s)]
*  Kazianis is a foreign policy analyst in Washington. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=524.68s)]
*  Like a lot of people in his business, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=527.52s)]
*  he regularly participates in government-sponsored war games. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=528.84s)]
*  These are designed to map out what would happen [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=532.04s)]
*  if various countries fell into conflict with one another. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  A couple of years ago, not long ago at all, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=537.16s)]
*  Kazianis participated in a war game predicated [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=539.28s)]
*  on a war with Russia. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=541.68s)]
*  He wrote about this the other day in The Federalist. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=543.48s)]
*  In the course of what we call the NATO-Russia War of 2019, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=546.04s)]
*  we estimated one billion people died. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=550.0s)]
*  One billion. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=553.88s)]
*  And if we aren't careful, what happened in a simulation [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=554.92s)]
*  could happen if a NATO-Russia War erupts over Ukraine. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=557.3199999999999s)]
*  That war has just erupted. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=561.76s)]
*  The fact that no one in charge seems to worry [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=563.76s)]
*  about where this could go should concern you quite a bit. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=565.76s)]
*  But nuclear war is not the only risk. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=568.84s)]
*  The economic consequences of this were already profound. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=570.44s)]
*  They're history-changing, actually. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=573.2800000000001s)]
*  And if you don't believe it, check out commodity prices. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=575.0s)]
*  They're out of control. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  Wheat is up nearly 60% over last year. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=578.48s)]
*  That's the highest price ever recorded for wheat. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  Not good news if you plan to eat, and it won't get better. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=584.32s)]
*  Russia is one of the largest fertilizer producers [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=588.0400000000001s)]
*  in the world. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=590.4s)]
*  So for example, a ton of urea fertilizer [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=591.6s)]
*  that cost American farmers $265 per ton last January [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=593.72s)]
*  now goes for $846 this year. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=599.08s)]
*  And thanks to sanctions, that number will get much higher. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=602.76s)]
*  No one who farms has ever seen anything like this. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  You probably don't farm, but you do buy groceries. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=607.88s)]
*  It'll be obvious to you soon. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=610.08s)]
*  In fact, thanks to Biden's foreign policy, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=611.6s)]
*  everything you buy is shooting up in price [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=613.88s)]
*  and shockingly fast. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=616.24s)]
*  Gasoline is now higher than it's ever been [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=618.32s)]
*  in the history of gasoline. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=620.2s)]
*  In Los Angeles, it is selling for $7.29 a gallon. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=622.84s)]
*  So if you make under a hundred grand a year, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=627.1600000000001s)]
*  and most people in this country do, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=629.32s)]
*  that qualifies as a crisis for you. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=631.32s)]
*  But for the people in charge, it's not high enough. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=634.2s)]
*  They'd like to make it worse. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=636.1600000000001s)]
*  Their latest idea that a lot of people seem to be buying [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=637.84s)]
*  is that we have a moral obligation somehow [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=640.34s)]
*  to stop buying Russian oil. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=642.6800000000001s)]
*  It's tainted. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=644.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=645.74s)]
*  What would happen if we did that? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=646.7600000000001s)]
*  Well, needless to say, oil prices would jump, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=648.6600000000001s)]
*  likely to over $150 a barrel, even higher prices for you. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  But then if that boycott spread, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=654.52s)]
*  and moral boycotts tend to, and Europe joined it, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=655.96s)]
*  buckle your seatbelt. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=658.56s)]
*  We talked to someone in the energy business this morning, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=659.98s)]
*  energy traders, to get a little perspective on this. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=662.04s)]
*  He said a total boycott of Russian energy [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  would cause, quote, an absolute global disaster. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=666.4s)]
*  That means recession, depression, uncontrollable inflation, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  and the rest, economic devastation to us and our allies. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=671.84s)]
*  And at that point, in fact, we're already there, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=677.54s)]
*  we'd be forced to make up the difference [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=679.6s)]
*  by getting more oil from other countries [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=681.52s)]
*  because we need the energy. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=683.56s)]
*  Batteries aren't gonna supply it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=685.68s)]
*  So what would those countries be? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=688.1199999999999s)]
*  Well, let's see, they would be, pretty clear, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=689.3199999999999s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=691.16s)]
*  To repeat, in order to wage a moral boycott, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=695.2399999999999s)]
*  we become more dependent on Saudi Arabia, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=698.5999999999999s)]
*  governed by Sharia law, Iran, a rogue state, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=701.4s)]
*  and Maduro's Venezuela. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=704.5999999999999s)]
*  Because this is a moral statement we're making. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a moral victory. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=708.28s)]
*  So feel good about it as you go bankrupt. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=709.5s)]
*  That's the short-term picture. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=711.5999999999999s)]
*  The long-term picture of war with Russia [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=713.16s)]
*  is even scarier than that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=714.88s)]
*  Thanks to Biden's policies, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=716.54s)]
*  Russia and China now form a bloc against the United States. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  This was the nightmare scenario, now it's real. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  Just today, the Chinese foreign minister [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=724.7199999999999s)]
*  described Vladimir Putin as China's, quote, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=727.16s)]
*  most important strategic partner. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=729.4s)]
*  So are we gonna see a boycott of Chinese goods [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=733.0s)]
*  in the United States? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=735.4s)]
*  They're making this war possible. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=736.56s)]
*  Oh, don't bet on it, that would be racist. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=737.8s)]
*  But we should prepare to lose our position [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=740.72s)]
*  as holder of the world's reserve currency. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=742.8s)]
*  That is happening in slow motion, it's unmistakable. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=745.56s)]
*  Now the Biden people seem to have no idea [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=749.2199999999999s)]
*  this is going on, or maybe they want it to happen. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=750.5999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden was up there at the State of the Union [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  bragging about how he took 30 points [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=754.28s)]
*  off the Russian ruble in a single day. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=755.92s)]
*  Hooray, good for us! [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=758.16s)]
*  But once we stop celebrating our win, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=760.8399999999999s)]
*  the destruction of the Russian economy, they deserve it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  You gotta wonder, is there a downside to this? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=766.06s)]
*  Could it be a Pyrrhic victory? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=768.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=769.3599999999999s)]
*  These policies have driven Russia, China, India, Turkey, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=770.96s)]
*  and other countries to accelerate their flight [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=775.44s)]
*  from the US dollar. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=777.44s)]
*  Now to be clear, that's the majority of the global economy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=778.6s)]
*  This may be the most reckless and destructive thing [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=783.32s)]
*  any American president has ever done to the United States. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=786.44s)]
*  If the war in Ukraine ended tomorrow, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=790.1600000000001s)]
*  we would live with the consequences of that, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=791.7800000000001s)]
*  loss of the US dollars, the world's reserve currency, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=794.5400000000001s)]
*  for the rest of our lives. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=797.2s)]
*  No one in Washington is even acknowledging this is happening. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=799.34s)]
*  They're looking for more moral victories to win. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=802.46s)]
*  And the companies love it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=805.94s)]
*  The woke companies, Apple, MasterCard, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=807.0600000000001s)]
*  lots of other American companies, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=809.1800000000001s)]
*  are taking victory laps for their role in punishing Russia. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=810.4200000000001s)]
*  Great, punish Russia. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=814.34s)]
*  We're not against that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=816.02s)]
*  But you've gotta wonder, you've just seen a handful [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=817.94s)]
*  of woke corporations crash a country [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=821.38s)]
*  and impoverish its citizens, indiscriminately. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=824.14s)]
*  Now that country is Russia, so most of us [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=826.44s)]
*  aren't even thinking about the precedent it sets. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=828.22s)]
*  We're fine with it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=830.0600000000001s)]
*  It's Russia who cares. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=831.02s)]
*  But is it possible these same techniques [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=832.9s)]
*  might be used someday against some place [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=835.62s)]
*  or somebody that you care about? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=837.6600000000001s)]
*  What if one morning you woke up and they decided [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=840.1800000000001s)]
*  that you're Vladimir Putin and you must be erased? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=841.94s)]
*  Could that happen? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=845.46s)]
*  Don't think about it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=846.3000000000001s)]
*  You're probably not able to think about it clearly [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=847.5s)]
*  right now, even if you tried. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=849.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=850.26s)]
*  Because there's a moral panic in progress. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=851.08s)]
*  For the record, this is the third moral panic [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=853.48s)]
*  we have had in the United States of America [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=856.02s)]
*  in less than two years. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=857.82s)]
*  You don't wanna live in a country [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=858.84s)]
*  in which moral panics break out regularly, by the way. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=860.34s)]
*  Moral panics diminish the people engaged in them [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=863.5400000000001s)]
*  and hurt the people who don't. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=866.46s)]
*  They're degrading, they're crazy. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=869.46s)]
*  They're the opposite of what you want. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=871.94s)]
*  You wanna live in a country where wisdom and restraint [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=873.5s)]
*  and rational behavior and decency determine the outcomes, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=877.74s)]
*  not screaming. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=880.7s)]
*  But we live in a country of moral panics. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=882.46s)]
*  The first one began in May of 2020 [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=883.8800000000001s)]
*  with the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=885.5s)]
*  That changed America completely. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=887.16s)]
*  The second moral panic was COVID. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=888.92s)]
*  You've lived through that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=891.76s)]
*  So for nearly two years, the shouting has not ended. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=893.04s)]
*  Hysteria is now the official language [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=895.88s)]
*  of public discourse in the United States. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=897.88s)]
*  That's not good for anyone except those benefiting from it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=900.4399999999999s)]
*  Who is benefiting? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  Anyone who lies for a living. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=904.04s)]
*  The liars have perfect cover. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=906.28s)]
*  Ask yourself, how much of what you first heard about BLM [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=908.16s)]
*  and then about the coronavirus [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=913.1s)]
*  turned out in the end to be true? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=914.36s)]
*  How many of the first stories were true? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  Not many. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=919.7199999999999s)]
*  It was almost all lies. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=921.06s)]
*  But you didn't know that at the time [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=922.8s)]
*  because you were busy being yelled at. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=924.0s)]
*  If you dared to point out that actually all lives matter, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=926.1s)]
*  they denounced you as a racist. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=928.92s)]
*  If you expressed concern about vaccine mandates, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=930.4599999999999s)]
*  of course they called you an anti-vaxxer. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=932.6s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=935.56s)]
*  The pattern never changes. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=936.38s)]
*  Hey, maybe war with Russia is not a good idea [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=937.2199999999999s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=939.1999999999999s)]
*  Say that out loud sometime. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=940.04s)]
*  It's not an extreme position. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=941.9599999999999s)]
*  Most Americans would agree with you. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=943.3399999999999s)]
*  But you will immediately be denounced as a tool of Putin. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=945.4s)]
*  What is this? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=948.64s)]
*  It's name calling as a means of social control. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=949.6800000000001s)]
*  The people in charge have decided their primary job [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=953.12s)]
*  is to decide who you should hate. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=955.6800000000001s)]
*  In an environment like this, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=959.44s)]
*  everything feels like propaganda [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=960.48s)]
*  and that's because much of it is. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=962.12s)]
*  On Thursday, we told you that Russian forces [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=964.6s)]
*  had bombed a nuclear reactor in Ukraine. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=966.6800000000001s)]
*  That seemed to be true. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  President Zelensky of Ukraine had said it repeatedly, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=969.96s)]
*  but it was not true. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=972.98s)]
*  No reactors were hit. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=974.22s)]
*  An unnamed Ukrainian official claimed that radiation levels [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  in the area had risen. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=978.24s)]
*  That turned out to be untrue as well. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=979.62s)]
*  In the words of Mark Nelson, who's a nuclear energy analyst, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=982.4200000000001s)]
*  quote, I'm afraid to say this looks like a coordinated [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=985.1800000000001s)]
*  effort to induce panic. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=987.4s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=989.9s)]
*  It was what we call disinformation [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=991.2s)]
*  and it was designed to get you [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=993.58s)]
*  to support a war against Russia. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=994.74s)]
*  Now maybe you support a war against Russia anyway, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=998.08s)]
*  but you should at least know that you're being lied to [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1000.58s)]
*  and manipulated, which you are. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1002.32s)]
*  Watch this segment from Good Morning America the other day. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1004.7800000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's mothers, daughters, teachers, politicians, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1007.9000000000001s)]
*  beauty queens, now on the front lines [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1011.5s)]
*  defending their country under siege. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1013.94s)]
*  And there is Anastasia Lena, a former Miss Grand Ukraine. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1016.34s)]
*  Photos of her on Instagram in fatigues, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1019.82s)]

*  Miss Ukraine with a rifle, defending her homeland. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1027.1000000000001s)]
*  Is there anything more inspiring than that? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1030.96s)]
*  It'd be more inspiring if it was real. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1033.6000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1035.0s)]
*  It was fake. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1035.8400000000001s)]
*  Miss Ukraine was not defending her homeland. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1036.72s)]
*  That wasn't a rifle. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1038.8s)]
*  It was an airsoft gun. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1039.8s)]
*  So the whole thing was not a news story, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1041.52s)]
*  though you read it as such. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1043.22s)]
*  It was a propaganda shoot. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1044.6000000000001s)]
*  It was meant to deceive you. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1045.88s)]
*  It was meant to make you want war with Russia. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1046.88s)]
*  Sympathize with one side over the other. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1049.24s)]
*  It works. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1051.88s)]
*  That's why they do it. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1052.72s)]
*  It's why the tech companies have censored [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1054.04s)]
*  so many news sites recently, including from Russia, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1055.72s)]
*  but not exclusively from Russia. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1057.96s)]
*  Now we're supposed to think this is a victory [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1059.8s)]
*  over Putin or something, but a victory for what? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1061.46s)]
*  Less information? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1065.82s)]
*  Fewer perspectives? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1067.02s)]
*  If getting to the truth was the point of the exercise, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1069.36s)]
*  we as American citizens would be able to read [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1071.98s)]
*  whatever we wanted to read. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1073.74s)]
*  That was the rule for centuries in this country. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1075.4199999999998s)]
*  It no longer is because truth is no longer the point. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1078.24s)]
*  Instead, Twitter and Facebook are proudly [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1081.34s)]
*  censoring any information that might, quote, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1083.72s)]
*  undermine trust in the Ukrainian government. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1085.6599999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1088.02s)]
*  Since when are we required to trust [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1089.34s)]
*  the Ukrainian government or any government? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1091.1s)]
*  Don't ask. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1095.22s)]
*  By the way, over the weekend, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1096.5s)]
*  because everything in America is unintentionally hilarious, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1097.5s)]
*  now the New York Times attacked Vladimir Putin [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1099.62s)]
*  for censorship. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1101.3799999999999s)]
*  Turns out he engages in censorship, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1102.4599999999998s)]
*  tries to control what his people can read. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1103.98s)]
*  Lost in the relentless focus on war in Ukraine, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1108.02s)]
*  by the way, is any perspective about the world or war, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1110.78s)]
*  which is always lacking in D.C., [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1113.86s)]
*  but never more so than now. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1115.1799999999998s)]
*  The fighting in Ukraine is terrible, of course. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1116.98s)]
*  You're seeing it happen. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1119.2s)]
*  No decent person could fail to be moved by the images, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1120.56s)]
*  but it's not unique. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1124.1200000000001s)]
*  It's not the only war in recent memory, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1125.8400000000001s)]
*  or even currently in progress right now. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1127.5s)]
*  Many thousands died in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1131.0800000000002s)]
*  that was between Azerbaijan and Armenia. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1134.96s)]
*  Ever heard of it? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1136.44s)]
*  It ended less than a year and a half ago. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1137.64s)]
*  No coverage. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1140.54s)]
*  There's been a gruesome war underway in Ethiopia [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1141.68s)]
*  for a couple of years now. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1144.2s)]
*  It's, again, in progress as we speak. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1145.28s)]
*  Tens of thousands of women have been raped by militiamen, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1147.68s)]
*  many of them intentionally infected with AIDS. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1150.48s)]
*  Can it get worse than that? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1152.8200000000002s)]
*  How many people have died in the war in Ethiopia? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1154.68s)]
*  We don't really know, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1156.44s)]
*  because no one in our media cares enough to keep track. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1157.8400000000001s)]

*  We do know that hundreds of thousands of people, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1162.2s)]
*  mostly civilians, have died in the war in Yemen. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1163.92s)]

*  It doesn't get a lot of attention. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1169.2s)]
*  It's just Yemen. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1170.3200000000002s)]

*  The death of someone in Ukraine is exactly equivalent [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1178.0s)]
*  to the death of someone in Yemen in its importance, period. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1180.8s)]

*  That's what we call it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1196.16s)]
*  It's likely killed more than a hundred thousand people. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1197.0s)]
*  In 2019 alone, close to 10,000 Mexican citizens [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1200.08s)]
*  just disappeared, most of them young men. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1203.04s)]
*  More journalists are murdered in Mexico every year [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1204.96s)]

*  But it's not a crisis. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1217.96s)]
*  It's totally normal, says the Biden administration. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1219.08s)]
*  Open the southern border. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1221.28s)]

*  It will hurt them on some deeper level [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1240.04s)]
*  because it does not serve the interests of this country. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1241.72s)]
*  A war fought on behalf of democracy [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC7DzTRS7A&t=1244.28s)]
