# Tucker: Biden, Harris aim to destroy the gun industry
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ)
*  So the Biden administration has somehow nearly one billion records of lawful firearms purchases made by Americans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  This is according to a new report by the Washington Free Beacon. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=9.36s)]
*  Now, to be clear, a federal firearms registry is explicitly banned by law. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=12.48s)]
*  The Congress has banned it. They're not allowed to keep any kind of registry like that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=17.16s)]
*  Now, they can check your credentials when they when you buy a gun. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=22.84s)]
*  Hunter Biden lied on his form. That's a felony. They've done nothing about it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=26.88s)]
*  But they can't maintain a registry. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  Last year, Joe Biden explained his goal. Watch. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=32.92s)]
*  And so what happens is I've gotten ATF alcohol, tobacco and firearms. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=36.72s)]
*  I have them increase their budget and increase their capacity, along with the Justice Department, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  to go after the gun shops that are not abiding by the law of doing background checks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=49.2s)]
*  But my point is all across the country, and it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=54.76s)]
*  They are either shadow gun dealers and or gun shops that are not abiding by the law. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=62.12s)]
*  So we're going to do major investigations and shut those guys down and put some of them in jail. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=69.0s)]
*  And for what they're doing, selling these weapons. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah, again, his son broke federal firearms law and they did nothing about it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=78.32s)]
*  They're letting people run around our cities with guns and not arresting them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=82.76s)]
*  They're trying to disarm people who didn't vote for them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=87.2s)]
*  I mean, it couldn't be clearer at this point. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=89.52s)]
*  J.D. Vance is a bestselling author. He's now running for Senate in the state of Ohio. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=91.72s)]
*  And we're happy to have him join us tonight. J.D. Vance, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=96.6s)]
*  So we've got record crime in our biggest cities. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=100.44s)]
*  And that's Joe Biden's response. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right, Tucker. So you think about it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=107.68s)]
*  This database is ultimately a backdoor to a gun registry in this country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=109.76s)]
*  And if you look at what liberals have done in Europe, what they've done in Australia, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=114.32s)]
*  once you allow a gun registry, you effectively allow the disarming of your citizenry. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=117.88s)]
*  This is ultimately about destroying the Second Amendment, just as the Democrats alliance [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=122.96s)]
*  with Big Tech is about destroying the First Amendment. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=127.6s)]
*  And my basic argument here, Tucker, is, look, if the Democrats are going to ignore [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=130.0s)]
*  the heavily armed drug cartels on our southern border, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=134.56s)]
*  but use the ATF to go after law abiding citizens, why don't we just get rid of the ATF? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=137.72s)]
*  Well, that is such a great point. I mean, there's a narco state right across the border [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=143.44s)]
*  from Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. I mean, the biggest narco state in the hemisphere, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=148.48s)]
*  heavily armed, no one's doing anything about it at all. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=152.88s)]
*  But they're mad because you've got a 12 gauge in your closet. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=155.48s)]
*  I mean, why do we have an ATF? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=158.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a great question. And, you know, I'm running in the Senate against this fraud [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=161.92s)]
*  of a Democrat, Tim Ryan, and you look at this guy, he portrays himself as a working class Democrat. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=166.2s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he's gone along with the inflation policies that destroy the dollar. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  He's gone along with the ship our jobs to China policies, which have destroyed the working class [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=175.92s)]
*  wages. And now he's going along with policies that destroy the Second Amendment in this country. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=180.48s)]
*  At the end of the day, Democrats say they care about the little people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=185.44s)]
*  You should care about their values and you should care about their rights. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm so sick of the Democrats saying they care when all they offer is a government check [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=192.04s)]
*  instead of a government that actually defends people's basic liberties. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. You'd think that a Democrat from the Mahoning Valley of Ohio could defend [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=201.44s)]
*  gun rights, but no, it's really changed. That party's changed. It's sad. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=206.2s)]
*  JD Vance, great to see you tonight. Thank you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=209.32s)]
*  Thanks, Decker. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=211.28s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmfHaCHhfQ&t=222.04s)]
