# This is about something much bigger than Eileen Gu: Cain
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [February 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y)
*  Aileen Gu is 18 years old. She's a skier. She was born in San Francisco. She's a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  favorite to win several gold medals in the Winter Olympics in China this year, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=4.72s)]
*  but she's not gonna be competing for the country of her birth or her [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=8.48s)]
*  citizenship. Instead she's going to be on China's Olympic team. She has one parent [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=11.08s)]
*  who was born in China and she switched sides despite the fact she's American. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=17.52s)]
*  What does this tell us about the moment we're living in and about our future? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Will Kane is the co-host of Fox and Friends Weekend. He's also the host of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=25.88s)]
*  the Will Kane podcast, which is excellent. He joins us now. Well thanks [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=29.36s)]
*  for coming on. This seemed like a significant story. Do you think that it is? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=32.24s)]
*  I think it is. I think it's a significant story if we consider that it's about [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=35.2s)]
*  something much bigger than Aileen Gu. Right. First with Aileen Gu. I mean it is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=41.12s)]
*  it is incredibly, I think the only word we can arrive at is ungrateful for her [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=45.64s)]
*  to betray, turn her back on the country that not just raised her but but turned [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  her into a world-class skier with the training and facilities that only the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=54.72s)]
*  United States of America can provide. For her to then turn her back on that in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=58.86s)]
*  exchange for money is shameful. It's ungrateful like a child that says I'm [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=62.26s)]
*  out of here. I'm moving somewhere else after being raised in a warm home. That's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=66.62s)]
*  what she is and she will soon, I suspect, Tucker come to regret it. I mean take a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=71.34s)]
*  look at the Chinese tennis player who dared to speak out about sexual [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=75.42s)]
*  harassment and then mysteriously disappeared. Aileen Gu I think has had to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=78.9s)]
*  sacrifice her American passport so welcome to China. I hope stardom and the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=82.08s)]
*  riches that you have earned through betraying America are all worth it [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=87.5s)]
*  because you have definitely sold out. Well that's exactly it and look you know [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=91.22s)]
*  this this girl's 18 you know you make dumb decisions you get stupid tattoos [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=95.98s)]
*  you renounce your citizenship to go to China whatever you know young people do [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=100.46s)]
*  dumb things but there should be collective revulsion as we watch this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=104.02s)]
*  like we shouldn't make it easy for people to betray their own country should [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=108.62s)]
*  we? We shouldn't but unfortunately and this gets to the point which you and I [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=111.46s)]
*  both alluded to a moment ago this is about something much bigger than Aileen [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=116.02s)]
*  Gu. Look she's supported by she's sponsored by Victoria's Secret, Louis [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=119.06s)]
*  Vuitton, the Chinese companies like Ultra which uses Chinese forced labor to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=123.66s)]
*  bring in cotton to make the shoes and athletic apparel that these athletes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=128.14s)]
*  make money off of and these corporate CEOs somewhat tied to the point you were [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  making a little bit earlier about the inherent weakness in American [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=136.26s)]
*  corporations and I would add to that the inherent immorality of capitalism [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=140.54s)]
*  devoid from a moral principled grounding is what we're looking at here [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=145.38s)]
*  because there's not an American company honestly Tucker there's very few [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=149.34s)]
*  American companies that wouldn't and haven't already done the same thing as [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=152.98s)]
*  Aileen Gu they've already turned their back on the United States of America in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=156.34s)]
*  exchange for Chinese riches and that's why she's a symbol you want to look at [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  something to be really upset about it's not the ungrateful child of America it's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=164.62s)]
*  the corrupt and weak corporations of America. No it's totally right I honestly [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=168.14s)]
*  think the shareholder system that the public company model that we have can't [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=173.42s)]
*  continue it doesn't actually work I mean these companies aren't going to thrive [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=178.38s)]
*  if they can't think long-term and think clearly and they and they can't what do [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=182.26s)]
*  I know seems that way. Will Kane I appreciate your analysis thank you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjeiQ4ZcY8Y&t=185.94s)]
