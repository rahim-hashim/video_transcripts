# Economist warns Tucker US is 'on brink of a 2008 style financial crisis'
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A)
*  Stephanie Pombo is an economist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=0.0s)]
*  She founded Macro Mavens, where she is the CEO. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=1.68s)]
*  She joins us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=4.72s)]
*  Stephanie, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  So can you just give us your coolest, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=7.16s)]
*  most detached assessment of what we're seeing? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=9.0s)]
*  This seems like a big deal, is it? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, I can't believe that you're not allayed [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=15.08s)]
*  by listening to Treasury Secretary Yellen. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=17.96s)]
*  I mean, clearly she's got the situation in hand. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=20.68s)]
*  I also am just stunned, Tucker, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=23.28s)]
*  that you don't believe that diversity, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=25.48s)]
*  equity and inclusion are the root [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=27.24s)]
*  of a sound financial system. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=30.36s)]
*  I mean, come on, where have you been for the last year, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=32.28s)]
*  Tucker? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=35.08s)]
*  It's time for the kids to be quiet. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=35.92s)]
*  And like, let's get some real economists here [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=37.68s)]
*  who aren't just like repeating Atlantic articles. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=42.56s)]
*  It is absolutely insane. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=44.68s)]
*  And the layers of insanity, I mean, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=46.82s)]
*  I can't even believe the videos you showed [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=49.32s)]
*  about the people at SVB, you know, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=51.42s)]
*  focused on the women's ski vacations and whatnot. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=56.82s)]
*  It's just nonsense. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=59.86s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=60.86s)]
*  What we're facing right now is really serious. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  I mean, we are on the brink [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=64.82000000000001s)]
*  of a 2008 style financial crisis, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=66.3s)]
*  and I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=69.98s)]
*  In fact, you and I discussed this at length [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=72.02s)]
*  in our long form interview several months ago. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=74.66s)]
*  And at the time, the Fed hadn't even raised rates [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=78.06s)]
*  nearly as high as they have today. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=80.78s)]
*  And I was saying, look, you don't raise rates [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  in record fashion on an economy toning record leverage [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=85.4s)]
*  at maximum speculation and expect no consequence. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=89.28s)]
*  I mean, this was clearly going to happen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=94.12s)]
*  And now we're seeing the weak links in the chain break. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  You know, the areas where speculation was most rampant [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=99.2s)]
*  and most egregious are clearly coming down [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  and they're doing so as they seem to do [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  in all the three-letter acronyms, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=108.4s)]
*  just like they did in 2008. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  We're back to the three-letter acronyms. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=113.24s)]
*  And there'll be a lot more of those. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  And frankly, I think this is the unintended consequence [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=117.52s)]
*  of the Fed's monetary policy layered [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  with really bad fiscal policy on top of it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=126.44s)]
*  But essentially, they've been encouraging people [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=129.98s)]
*  to take reckless risks for years [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=132.44s)]
*  just because you had no alternative. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=135.48s)]
*  You could get 0% sitting in a T-bill [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=137.72s)]
*  or having your money in the bank, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  or you could run out and you could speculate. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=142.4s)]
*  And that's what they've done. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=145.32s)]
*  And that's all coming back to bite them hard. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  And we've got some major consequences coming at us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=150.12s)]
*  And I think it's gonna devolve very rapidly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=153.8s)]
*  because of all the leverage that's been built up here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  It's exactly right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=159.4s)]
*  If you treated your children [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=160.24s)]
*  like the Fed has treated Wall Street, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=161.52s)]
*  your kids would all be in rehab. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=163.32s)]
*  You know, what they've done is bad, no doubt. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  Stephanie Pomboy, I appreciate your wisdom on this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=167.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=168.96s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=170.68s)]
*  Pleasure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4W3iNJc6A&t=171.72s)]
