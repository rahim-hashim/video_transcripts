# Elon Musk reveals the goal of the new Twitter
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE)
*  Elon Musk bought Twitter because he used Twitter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=3.4s)]
*  And he was infuriated by Twitter's effort to silence people on the internet. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=4.4s)]
*  That's how strongly he believed in free speech. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=9.48s)]
*  He paid $44 billion and immediately lost tens of billions of dollars doing it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=11.08s)]
*  And when he took over and looked behind the curtain, he discovered Twitter was really [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=15.08s)]
*  a tool of the global intel agencies to spy on people and emit propaganda. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=25.72s)]
*  You bought Twitter famously. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=29.36s)]
*  You've got a lot of other businesses and a lot going on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=30.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=34.16s)]
*  You said you bought it because you believe in speech, free speech. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=35.16s)]
*  You've had a lot of hassle since you bought it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=38.4s)]
*  In retrospect, was it worth buying it? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=40.24s)]
*  I mean, it remains to be seen as to whether this was financially smart. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=43.72s)]
*  Currently, it is not. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=48.2s)]
*  We just revalued the company at less than half of the acquisition price. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=51.24s)]
*  Did you really? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=54.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=55.6s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=56.6s)]
*  No, my timing was terrible for when the offer was made because it was right before advertising [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=58.6s)]
*  plummeted. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  You caught the high watermark, I noticed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=72.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=73.0s)]
*  So I must be a real genius here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=74.0s)]
*  My timing is amazing since I've bought it for at least twice as much as it should have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=76.0s)]
*  been bought for. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=81.88s)]
*  But some things are priceless. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=84.2s)]
*  So whether I'm losing money or not, that is a secondary issue compared to ensuring the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=86.6s)]
*  strength of democracy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=93.6s)]
*  Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=96.36s)]
*  The speech needs to be as transparent and truthful as possible. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  So we've got a huge push on Twitter to be as truthful as possible. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=105.56s)]
*  We've got this community notes feature, which is great. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  It is great. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=112.6s)]
*  It is awesome. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=113.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=114.6s)]
*  We got this morning. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=115.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=116.6s)]
*  It was far more honest than the New York Times. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=117.6s)]
*  It's great. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=118.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=119.88s)]
*  We put a lot of effort to ensuring that community notes does not get gamed or have biases. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=120.88s)]
*  It simply cares about what is the most accurate thing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=125.24s)]
*  And sometimes truth can be a little bit elusive, but you can still aspire to get closer to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=130.24s)]
*  it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=134.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=135.2s)]
*  And I think the effect of community notes is more powerful than people may realize because [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=136.2s)]
*  once people know that they could get community noted on Twitter, then they'll think more [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  carefully about what they say. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=151.52s)]
*  Basically it's an encouragement to be more truthful and less deceptive. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=155.0s)]
*  When you jumped into this, though, when you bought it, did you understandâ€”well, clearly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  you understood its importance. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=161.96s)]
*  You wouldn't have bought it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=162.96s)]
*  Twitter, yes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=163.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=164.96s)]
*  But it's not the biggest, but it's the most important in the social media companies. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=165.96s)]
*  But did you understand the kind of ferocity you'd be facing, the attacks you'd be facing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=169.72s)]
*  from power centers in the country? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=175.16s)]
*  I thought there'd probably be some negative reactions, yes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=178.88s)]
*  So I'm sure everyone would not be pleased with it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=184.68s)]
*  But at the end of the day, if the public is happy with it, that's what matters. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=189.6s)]
*  And the public will speak with their actions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=197.28s)]
*  If they find truth on Twitter to be useful, they will use it more. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=199.96s)]
*  And if they find it to be not useful, they will use it less. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=204.36s)]
*  If they find it to be the best source of truth, I think they will use it more. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=206.96s)]
*  There's obviously a lot of organizations that are used to having unfettered influence [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=212.48s)]
*  on Twitter that no longer have that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=219.36s)]
*  We used to pick New York Times of their badge this morning, and then you called them diarrhea. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=222.64s)]
*  You called themâ€” [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=226.96s)]
*  You did. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=227.96s)]
*  I'm just quoting you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=228.96s)]
*  You described their Twitter feed as diarrhea. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=230.8s)]
*  I said it was the Twitter equivalent of diarrhea. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  OK, it's not literally diarrhea. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  No, it's a metaphor. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=237.88s)]
*  But an accurate one. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=242.56s)]
*  So if you look at NY Times, Twitter feed is unreadable. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=244.68s)]
*  Because what they do is they tweet every single article, even the ones that are boring, even [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  ones that don't make it into the paper. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  So it's just nonstop, zillion tweets a day with noâ€” [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=258.16s)]
*  They really should just be saying, what are the top tweets? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=262.44s)]
*  What are the big stories of the day? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=266.72s)]
*  I don't know, put out like 10 or something. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=269.8s)]
*  Some number that's manageable. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  As opposed to right now, if you were to follow at NY Times on Twitter, you're going to get [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=275.8s)]
*  barraged with hundreds of tweets a day. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=280.56s)]
*  And your whole feed will be filled with NY Times. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  So this is something I would recommend actually for oral publications, which is for your primary [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=286.08s)]
*  feed, only put out your best stuff. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=293.4s)]
*  I think I know a thing or two about how to use Twitter, because I was the most interacted [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=295.76s)]
*  with account on the whole system before the acquisition closed. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=300.36s)]
*  I didn't have the most number of followers, but I had the most number of interactions. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=303.32s)]
*  And so I clearly know something about how to use Twitter. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=308.76s)]
*  People's attention is limited, so just make sure you put the stuff that's most important [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=312.12s)]
*  there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=315.56s)]
*  So because you and people like you do interact on Twitter, it's obviously enormously powerful [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=316.56s)]
*  in shaping public opinion. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=323.88s)]
*  It's where a lot of ideas and trends are incubated. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=325.28s)]
*  You know it, that's why you buy it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=327.84s)]
*  It's also a magnet for intel agencies from around the world. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=329.88s)]
*  And one of the things we learned after you started opening the books is that they were [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=333.52s)]
*  exerting influence from within Twitter. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=337.42s)]
*  I mean, it was absurd. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=340.08s)]
*  Did you know that going in? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=344.32s)]
*  No. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=345.52s)]
*  Since I've been a heavy Twitter user since 2009, it's sort of like I'm in the matrix. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=346.52s)]
*  I mean, I can see, like, do things feel right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=353.52s)]
*  Do they not feel right? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=357.32s)]
*  What tweets am I being shown as recommended? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  I get a feel, like, what accounts are making comments? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=363.68s)]
*  Where are the comments eerily similar? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=367.6s)]
*  And then you look at the account and it's just obviously a fake photo and, you know, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=372.6s)]
*  it's just obviously a bot cluster over and over again. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  So I started to get, like, just more and more uneasy about the Twitter situation. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=380.8s)]
*  I started to feel like something's wrong in the state of Denmark here. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  Something feels wrong about the platform. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=389.72s)]
*  It seemed to be just drifting in a, I couldn't place it exactly, just it had a, it felt [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=391.88s)]
*  like it was drifting in a bad direction. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=397.88s)]
*  So then I was like, and my conversations with the board and management seemed to confirm [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=399.68s)]
*  my intuition about that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=405.96s)]
*  But basically I was convinced these guys do not care about fixing Twitter. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  And I had a bad feeling about where I was headed based on the conversations I had with [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=414.36s)]
*  them. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=418.24s)]
*  So then I was like, you know what, I'll try acquiring it and see if acquiring it is possible. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=419.24s)]
*  Now I didn't have enough cash to acquire it, so I would need support from others, from [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=428.52s)]
*  some of the existing investors. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  I would also need, like, a lot of debt. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=434.32s)]
*  And so it wasn't clear to me whether an acquisition would succeed, but I thought I would try. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=436.76s)]
*  And ultimately it did succeed. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=442.08s)]
*  Anyway, here we are. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=444.76s)]
*  But when you got there and all of a sudden you own it and all the data on the servers [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=446.52s)]
*  belongs to you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=449.96s)]
*  Well, it belongs to the people in my view, but yes. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=450.96s)]
*  But you can see what it is. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=453.79999999999995s)]
*  I guess. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  And you can see what they've been doing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=455.79999999999995s)]
*  And you can see who's been working there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=456.88s)]
*  You were shocked to find out that various intel agencies were affecting its operations? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=458.76s)]
*  The degree to which various government agencies had effectively had full access to everything [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  that was going on on Twitter blew my mind. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=471.6s)]
*  I was not aware of that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=474.32s)]
*  Would that include people's DMs? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=475.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=478.72s)]
*  Yes, because the DMs are not encrypted. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=479.72s)]
*  So one of the things that we're about to release is the ability to encrypt your DMs. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=484.2s)]
*  That's pretty heavy duty, though, because a lot of well-known people, reporters talking [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=489.12s)]
*  to their sources, government officials, the richest people in the world, they're DMing [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=493.24s)]
*  each other. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  And the assumption, obviously it was incorrect, but was that that's private, but that was [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=498.44s)]
*  being read by various governments? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=502.52s)]
*  Yeah, that seems to be, yes. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=504.84s)]
*  Scary. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=508.32s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=509.32s)]
*  So like I said, we're moving to have the DMs be optionally encrypted. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=510.8s)]
*  I mean, there's like a lot of DM conversations which are just chatting with friends. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=517.2s)]
*  It's not important. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=521.16s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=522.16s)]
*  It's hopefully coming out later this month, but no later than next month, is the ability [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=523.16s)]
*  to toggle encryption on or off. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=527.8s)]
*  So if you are in a conversation you think is sensitive, you can just toggle encryption [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=530.36s)]
*  on and then no one on Twitter can see what you're talking about. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=534.12s)]
*  I could put a gun to my head and I couldn't tell. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=537.48s)]
*  That's sort of the gun to the head test. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=542.52s)]
*  If somebody puts a gun to my head and I can I still not see your DMs? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=543.52s)]
*  That's the acid test. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=549.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=550.32s)]
*  And that's how it should be if you want your... [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=551.32s)]
*  Have you had complaints from various governments about doing this? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=554.52s)]
*  I haven't had direct complaints to me. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=557.8s)]
*  I've had sort of like some indirect complaints. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=559.84s)]
*  I think people are a little concerned about complaining to me directly in case I tweet [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=562.32s)]
*  about it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=565.86s)]
*  You know. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=566.86s)]
*  They're like, uh-oh. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=567.86s)]
*  So there's sort of a tend to be more roundabout than that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=573.5s)]
*  You know, I mean, if I got something that was unconstitutional from the U.S. government, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=575.82s)]
*  my reply would be to send them a copy of the First Amendment and just say like, what part [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  of this are we getting wrong? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=586.02s)]
*  You have a lot of government contracts. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=589.02s)]
*  I'm just curious, what part of this are we getting wrong? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=591.02s)]
*  Please tell me. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=592.5s)]
*  No, I'm just saying, but you're kind of exposed to new other businesses. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=593.66s)]
*  So this is just in case our viewers aren't following this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=596.02s)]
*  This is not you're not just like a journalist taking a stand on behalf of the First Amendment. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=599.48s)]
*  You're a guy with big government contracts giving the finger to the government. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=602.98s)]
*  Do you think Twitter will be as central to this presidential campaign as it was in the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=606.84s)]
*  last several? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=614.06s)]
*  I think it will play a significant role in elections, not just domestically, but internationally. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=615.4s)]
*  The goal of new Twitter is to be as fair and even-handed as possible. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=620.98s)]
*  So not favoring any political ideology, but just being fair at all. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=627.22s)]
*  Why doesn't Facebook do this? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=637.34s)]
*  I know that Zuckerberg has said, and I take him at face value, that he... [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=638.58s)]
*  Well, I do actually in this way, that he is a kind of old fashioned liberal who doesn't [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=642.74s)]
*  like to censor, he has, but he... [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  Why wouldn't a company like that take the stand that you have taken? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=651.52s)]
*  Which is pretty rooted in American traditional political custom for free speech. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=655.52s)]
*  My understanding is that Zuckerberg spent $400 million in the last election, normally [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=663.52s)]
*  in a get out the vote campaign, but really fundamentally in support of Democrats. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=670.48s)]
*  Is that accurate or not accurate? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=674.68s)]
*  That is accurate. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=676.0s)]
*  Does that sound unbiased to you? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=677.6s)]
*  No it doesn't. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=679.72s)]
*  So you don't see hope that Facebook will approach this as a non-aligned arbiter. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=681.52s)]
*  You've allowed Donald Trump back on Twitter, he hasn't taken you up on your offer because [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=688.04s)]
*  he's got his own thing. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=691.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=692.28s)]
*  Do you think he will go back on Twitter? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=693.28s)]
*  Well that's obviously up to him. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=696.24s)]
*  My job is to... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=699.1600000000001s)]
*  I take freedom of speech very seriously. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=702.76s)]
*  So it's... [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=708.32s)]
*  I didn't vote for Donald Trump, I actually voted for Biden. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=711.6s)]
*  Not saying I'm a huge fan of Biden, because I think that would probably be inaccurate. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=714.08s)]
*  But we have difficult choices to make in these presidential elections. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=719.0s)]
*  I would prefer, frankly, that we put someone, just a normal person, as president. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=724.92s)]
*  A normal person with common sense, and whose values are smack in the middle of the country, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, just center of the normal distribution, and I think they would be great. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=739.76s)]
*  I think we have made maybe being president not that much fun, you know, to be totally frank. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxStDmHFAE&t=745.88s)]
