# Oil & Gas Association chief sends a 'call for BS' to end at the White House
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ)
*  Tim Stewart is the president of the U.S. Gas and Oil Association. We're honored to be joined by him tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tim, thanks so much for coming on. So, you know, to someone who's not in the business, as you are selling off an asset like this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=5.0s)]
*  and allowing it to be sold to China seems like criminal, honestly. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=13.5s)]
*  You know, Tucker, you articulate it better than just about anybody. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=19.5s)]
*  The question, I think, to answer that question, we have to ask ourselves, how did we get here in the first place? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=23.5s)]
*  How did we replace one bad policy with another bad policy? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=29.5s)]
*  How did we go from being the world's energy superpower, being number one in oil and gas and coal and geothermal [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=33.0s)]
*  and second in wind and solar, to shaking the tin cup to the Saudis and not even being able to track where our strategic petroleum releases end up? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=40.0s)]
*  It's really quite disconcerting, isn't it? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=50.0s)]
*  I would say it's really important to know that the exploration production companies were not supportive of the strategic petroleum reserve release. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=54.0s)]
*  Why weren't we allowed to just open up the spigot of what we're already doing versus shutting that off and tapping into the nation's credit card? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=62.0s)]
*  It really is quite frustrating. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=70.0s)]
*  I've got to be honest, I've talked to most of the people who run the oil and gas companies and they all act like they're selling cigarettes to kids. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=71.5s)]
*  They're always a little bit embarrassed, oh, it's oil and gas, but really we're about green energy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=77.5s)]
*  Why don't they step up in public and say, without us, this is an impoverished country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=80.5s)]
*  This is central Africa. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=85.0s)]
*  You need us in order to stay solvent and make some noise and fight back. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=86.0s)]
*  Well, and we're trying to. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=93.0s)]
*  That tweet that the president sent out on Saturday, we had a response where, you know how it is, Twitter is sort of an exercise in futility. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=95.0s)]
*  There are thousands and thousands of people who think that they're experts in oil and gas because they re-tweet something that some celebrity does. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=104.0s)]
*  And so we've avoided it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=111.0s)]
*  But we saw that tweet come across and it just sort of struck a nerve. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=113.0s)]
*  And so we did our best to kind of call the BS on the White House and say, look, somebody's got to go back and look at economics here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=117.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is over if we get rid of fossil fuels. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=124.0s)]
*  That's just true. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=128.0s)]
*  And I wish we could stop whining about it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=129.0s)]
*  Tim Stewart, I appreciate your coming on tonight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=130.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=132.5s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-OCPsioGQ&t=133.5s)]
