# Tucker Carlson: This was all a lie
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=0.0s)]
*  and Happy Tuesday. We'll admit it up front, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=2.0s)]
*  we can't get off this Martha's Vineyard store [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=4.0s)]
*  because there's just so much there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=6.0s)]
*  So last week you'll recall, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=8.0s)]
*  our Venezuelan visitors to this country, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=10.0s)]
*  our brothers and sisters, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=12.0s)]
*  as they're now known on CNN, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=14.0s)]
*  took what amounted to the shortest vacation [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=16.0s)]
*  ever recorded to Martha's Vineyard. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=18.0s)]
*  They were on that island for just hours, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=20.0s)]
*  less than two full days. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=22.0s)]
*  It was hardly enough time to pick up a fair trade coffee [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=24.0s)]
*  at Mocha Motz in Vineyard Haven [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=26.0s)]
*  or go kite boarding on South Beach. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=28.0s)]
*  In fact, we have literally been talking [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=30.0s)]
*  about their trip longer than it lasted. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=32.0s)]
*  It was that brief. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=34.0s)]
*  On the other hand, so was the moon landing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=36.0s)]
*  So was the Wright Brothers' first flight at Kitty Hawk. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=38.0s)]
*  Duration is no measure of effect. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=40.0s)]
*  Those brief hours [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=42.0s)]
*  our Venezuelan brothers and sisters [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=44.0s)]
*  spent on Martha's Vineyard changed history [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=46.0s)]
*  and left what they're calling [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=48.0s)]
*  an indelible mark on the people who live there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=50.0s)]
*  They enriched us, said one resident. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=52.0s)]
*  We were happy to help them, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=54.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, as it turned out, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=56.0s)]
*  that journey ended abruptly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=58.0s)]
*  at a military base on Cape Cod [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=60.0s)]
*  where our Venezuelan brothers and sisters [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=62.0s)]
*  are now being held against their will. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=64.0s)]
*  Prisoners in a country they thought was their own. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=66.0s)]
*  There are no Mocha Motz where they are now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=68.0s)]
*  Kite boarding is completely out of the question. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=70.0s)]
*  It's just a bitter dream at this point. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=72.0s)]
*  Now, the people of Martha's Vineyard [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=74.0s)]
*  knew this was going to happen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=76.0s)]
*  And yet, none of them thought to tell [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=78.0s)]
*  their Venezuelan brothers and sisters [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=80.0s)]
*  that they were going to die. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=82.0s)]
*  They thought to tell their Venezuelan brothers and sisters [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=84.0s)]
*  before it happened. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=86.0s)]
*  Quote, I kept telling them it was like a dormitory, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=88.0s)]
*  said Jackie Stallings, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=90.0s)]
*  who lives on the island, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=92.0s)]
*  as soldiers arrive to deport her Venezuelan siblings. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=94.0s)]
*  I didn't want to say, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=96.0s)]
*  you're going to a military base. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=98.0s)]
*  Well, of course not. It's a dormitory. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=100.0s)]
*  Just like your dad sent your elderly dog to a farm [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=102.0s)]
*  because he'll be happier there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=104.0s)]
*  But the Venezuelans [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=106.0s)]
*  are not happier in military lockup. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=108.0s)]
*  They loved Martha's Vineyard. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=110.0s)]
*  As they told MSNBC, they considered it a paradise. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=112.0s)]
*  They left here a few minutes ago. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=114.0s)]
*  They moved to Cape Cod, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=116.0s)]
*  to the joint base in Cape Cod, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=118.0s)]
*  with new clothes, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=120.0s)]
*  new cell phones, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=122.0s)]
*  haven't talked to lawyers for the first time [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=124.0s)]
*  and saying that they were actually brought to paradise. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=126.0s)]
*  They don't resent it for now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=128.0s)]
*  And they know they're the lucky ones. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=130.0s)]
*  So finally, one reporter [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=132.0s)]
*  over at NBC News tells the truth [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=134.0s)]
*  about what is actually a pretty sad story. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=136.0s)]
*  Our Venezuelan brothers and sisters [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=138.0s)]
*  came to this country for a better life. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=140.0s)]
*  And unlike so many, they actually found it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=142.0s)]
*  They arrived in one of the prettiest [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=144.0s)]
*  and most affluent destinations on the planet, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=146.0s)]
*  an idyllic island with unlimited resources [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=148.0s)]
*  and many thousands of empty beds. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=150.0s)]
*  And best of all, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=152.0s)]
*  a population that claimed to love them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=154.0s)]
*  No person is illegal, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=156.0s)]
*  read the lawn signs. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=158.0s)]
*  But it was all a lie. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=160.0s)]
*  50 brown people was too many [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=162.0s)]
*  for the people of Martha's Vineyard. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=164.0s)]
*  They called in the army to have them removed, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=166.0s)]
*  like trash, as one island resident said. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=168.0s)]
*  So actually, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=170.0s)]
*  judging by their behavior [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=172.0s)]
*  and not simply by their lawn signs, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=174.0s)]
*  which is the best way to judge people, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=176.0s)]
*  the people of Martha's Vineyard are not especially compassionate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=178.0s)]
*  In fact, they're small-minded [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=180.0s)]
*  and cheap and pretty nasty, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=182.0s)]
*  as any waiter or babysitter [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=184.0s)]
*  who works on the island can tell you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=186.0s)]
*  So once again, the ones who claim [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=188.0s)]
*  to be the best people [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=190.0s)]
*  are actually the worst people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=192.0s)]
*  Remember when Jimmy Swagger [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=194.0s)]
*  got busted with hookers and porn? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=196.0s)]
*  It's very much like that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=198.0s)]
*  The truth turns out to be the opposite of what they told you it was. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=200.0s)]
*  It's highly embarrassing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=202.0s)]
*  But here's the weird thing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=204.0s)]
*  On Martha's Vineyard, they're not embarrassed at all. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=206.0s)]
*  Jimmy Swagger famously apologized [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=208.0s)]
*  for his sins because he had shame. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=210.0s)]
*  But the people of Martha's Vineyard have no shame. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=214.0s)]
*  And so they're not apologizing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=216.0s)]
*  In fact, against all evidence, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=218.0s)]
*  they're now bragging about how wonderful they are. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=220.0s)]
*  Yesterday, Kerry Pickett of the Washington Times [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=224.0s)]
*  caught up with Martha's Vineyard's senior sender. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=226.0s)]
*  That would be Ms. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=228.0s)]
*  Listen to Elizabeth Warren's version [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=230.0s)]
*  of the Martha's Vineyard story. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=232.0s)]
*  Do you think Martha's Vineyard is getting a bad rap right now? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=244.0s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=246.0s)]
*  Yeah. No. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=248.0s)]
*  I think they did. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=250.0s)]
*  The people of Martha's Vineyard [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=252.0s)]
*  opened their hearts [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=254.0s)]
*  and were helpful [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=256.0s)]
*  to the migrants [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=258.0s)]
*  who were deceived [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=260.0s)]
*  and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=262.0s)]
*  dropped there [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=264.0s)]
*  in a privately [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=266.0s)]
*  chartered jet [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=268.0s)]
*  and treated like a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=270.0s)]
*  prop [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=272.0s)]
*  for a governor [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=274.0s)]
*  who's just trying to make [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=276.0s)]
*  news. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=278.0s)]
*  Well, if nothing else, it's interesting to see history, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=280.0s)]
*  history that we've watched unfold, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=282.0s)]
*  a story in which the facts are not at all in dispute, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=284.0s)]
*  get rewritten in real time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=286.0s)]
*  And you wonder how many other stories have been rewritten. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=288.0s)]
*  But we can see this one being rewritten. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=290.0s)]
*  In Elizabeth Warren's telling, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=292.0s)]
*  actually, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=294.0s)]
*  the people of Martha's Vineyard are the heroes [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=296.0s)]
*  and Ron DeSantis is the villain [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=298.0s)]
*  because he deceived them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=300.0s)]
*  Now, we're not going to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=302.0s)]
*  go into the details of the story [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=304.0s)]
*  because we're going to go into the details of the story. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=306.0s)]
*  But they were deceived them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=308.0s)]
*  Now, we just heard, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=310.0s)]
*  and it's again factually not in dispute, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=312.0s)]
*  that island residents deceived [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=314.0s)]
*  their Venezuelan siblings by telling them [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=316.0s)]
*  they were just going to a dorm. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=318.0s)]
*  They're not being locked up on a military base [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=320.0s)]
*  like terrorists. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=322.0s)]
*  So actually, the people of Martha's Vineyard, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=324.0s)]
*  the residents there, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=326.0s)]
*  are the ones who did the tricking. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=328.0s)]
*  They tricked the Venezuelans [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=330.0s)]
*  into going to a military base. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=332.0s)]
*  But that wasn't deception. Now, according to Elizabeth Warren, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=334.0s)]
*  it was an act of love. But at some point, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=336.0s)]
*  whatever, the people of Martha's Vineyard [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=338.0s)]
*  got what they wanted. Everything is back to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=340.0s)]
*  normal there. The people who live there [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=342.0s)]
*  are relieved. They're not going to be [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=344.0s)]
*  50 needing minorities in their midst [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=346.0s)]
*  to spoil the usual festivities. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=348.0s)]
*  And that would include the Food and Wine [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=350.0s)]
*  Festival. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=352.0s)]
*  So, just so you know, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=366.0s)]
*  you taste the wine, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=392.0s)]
*  and then eat the oyster, and then you taste the wine again. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=394.0s)]
*  OK, and the way they mesh in your mouth, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=396.26s)]
*  those flavors, the complexity of them, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=398.36s)]
*  it's like an explosion on your palate. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=402.24s)]
*  And that's why thousands of people [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=404.68s)]
*  come to Martha's Vineyard every year for that festival. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=406.12s)]
*  But guess who doesn't come? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=408.6s)]
*  Venezuelans, unless they're serving the oysters [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=410.08s)]
*  and pouring the wine. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=413.76s)]
*  So really, we could go on at great length about this, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=415.84s)]
*  because it's just such a great story and reveals so much. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=418.64s)]
*  But it's much bigger than the now established fact [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=421.16s)]
*  that Martha's Vineyard is populated [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  by nasty liberals who don't tip and don't actually [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=427.04s)]
*  want colored people in their midst. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=431.6s)]
*  We know that now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=432.16s)]
*  But the bigger story, and the one that affects the rest of us, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=433.56s)]
*  the other 340 million people who live here, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  is that what we saw in Martha's Vineyard is, in fact, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=438.6s)]
*  just a taste of what is absolutely [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=441.44000000000005s)]
*  the official policy of the Democratic Party. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=443.72s)]
*  And it is this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=446.20000000000005s)]
*  If your town votes the right way, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=447.68s)]
*  then you get military protection. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=450.24s)]
*  The military shows up immediately, 50 people, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=452.44s)]
*  not hurting anybody. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=455.04s)]
*  And the army comes to remove them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=456.12s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=458.32000000000005s)]
*  Talk about a 911 call. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  That's pretty great. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=462.48s)]
*  All you need to do is vote 80% for Joe Biden, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=463.6s)]
*  and you can do that and throw some donations his way, too. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=465.48s)]
*  But what about everybody else? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=469.12s)]
*  Well, everyone else is SOL, and that would include all of us. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=470.88s)]
*  Over the past 11 months, American authorities [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=476.16s)]
*  have encountered more than 2 million illegals [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  along the southern border. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=480.56s)]
*  That's the highest number ever recorded by the US government. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  At least another 1 million were allowed into this country [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=484.44s)]
*  as so-called economic migrants, meaning they want better jobs [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=487.2s)]
*  because who doesn't want a better job? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=490.52000000000004s)]
*  Hundreds, thousands more. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=492.56s)]
*  We don't know the number, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=493.68s)]
*  but clearly hundreds of thousands just sneaked in. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=494.68s)]
*  That's according to the official data. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=497.64s)]
*  Now, how many of those are headed to military bases [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=499.48s)]
*  for deportation? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=502.24s)]
*  In how many cases did the US military arrive [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=503.88s)]
*  to solve what is so clearly a disaster? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=507.71999999999997s)]
*  Zero, because it wasn't Martha's Vineyard. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=511.11999999999995s)]
*  Now, we've been making a documentary on this, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=514.04s)]
*  a documentary on the border. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=517.16s)]
*  It's called Battle for the Borders, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=518.4s)]
*  coming out later this year. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=519.6s)]
*  And in the course of reporting that out, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=520.72s)]
*  we obtained this footage showing how some of these illegal [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=522.64s)]
*  aliens enter this country. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=525.56s)]
*  These pictures were shot on July 23rd this year. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=527.36s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=534.84s)]
*  Stay police. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=536.24s)]
*  Where you from? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  Huh? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=539.36s)]
*  Pakistan. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=541.36s)]
*  What you all doing here? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=543.36s)]
*  Keep your hands out of your pocket. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=545.36s)]
*  You got any weapons on you? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=547.36s)]
*  You got an ID? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=549.36s)]
*  Come on, come on, shoot him in the head. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=551.36s)]
*  No IDs? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=563.84s)]
*  No machine, no machine. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=565.84s)]
*  Machine, good. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=567.84s)]
*  So when people on Martha's Vineyard [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=569.84s)]
*  think of illegal immigration, they really [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=572.0s)]
*  think groundskeepers and waiters and people [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=575.52s)]
*  who work at the back end of the kitchen, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  people who clean up or prepare the food. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what illegal immigration is to them. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=584.96s)]
*  They're not really thinking, none of us [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=587.44s)]
*  are really thinking that people might be showing up from Pakistan. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=589.1600000000001s)]
*  Really, Pakistan? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=592.0s)]
*  They didn't walk. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=593.12s)]
*  And by the way, isn't Pakistan the place [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=594.48s)]
*  where ISIS has just called for jihadis to enter the United [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=596.16s)]
*  States and kill Americans? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=598.68s)]
*  Why are these guys walking along a road in Texas? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=600.04s)]
*  Now, during their interview with the police, both of the men [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  you just saw admitted they were here illegally. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=605.96s)]
*  They said they each paid thousands of dollars [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=608.0s)]
*  to be smuggled into the United States. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=609.76s)]
*  This is very common now. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=611.36s)]
*  It's not the immigration you remember. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=613.12s)]
*  Who are these people? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=616.2s)]
*  Do they mean us harm? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not simply a matter of competing [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=618.64s)]
*  for jobs with American citizens. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=620.2s)]
*  It's potentially a grave threat. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=623.2s)]
*  And a lot of people like this are coming across the border [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=625.36s)]
*  right now. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=627.5600000000001s)]
*  Here's Fox's Bill Mlugin. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=628.44s)]
*  For the very first time, a brand new Fox News drone [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=630.88s)]
*  equipped with thermal imaging captures images [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=634.32s)]
*  of mass illegal crossings in the middle of the night [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=637.0400000000001s)]
*  in Eagle Pass, Texas this morning. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=639.76s)]
*  Migrants could be seen crossing the river [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=641.84s)]
*  and walking onto private property, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=643.76s)]
*  where over 100 gathered and waited [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=645.5200000000001s)]
*  for border patrol processing. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=647.72s)]
*  Sometimes the Del Rio sector here [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=649.2800000000001s)]
*  gets upwards of 2,000 illegal crossings in a single day. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=651.16s)]
*  And this was only one of three huge groups [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=655.72s)]
*  we have already seen so far this morning. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=658.64s)]
*  And it's not even noon yet out here. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  Take a look at this second group we saw. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=662.72s)]
*  This was another group of about 200 who crossed illegally [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=664.36s)]
*  and started walking along a local highway out here. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=668.08s)]
*  This is how it is in Eagle Pass. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=670.84s)]
*  You can just be driving down the road [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=672.12s)]
*  and you'll see large groups of several hundred migrants [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=673.84s)]
*  just walking down the highway, waiting to be picked up [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=676.04s)]
*  and apprehended by border patrol. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=678.84s)]
*  So we're just getting word right now [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=681.92s)]
*  that the White House, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=683.72s)]
*  many White House officials are telling, quote, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  journalists that they are very annoyed [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=687.12s)]
*  by Bill Mollugin's reporting. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=689.36s)]
*  It's, quote, alarmist. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=690.72s)]
*  In other words, unlike reporters [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=692.2s)]
*  at the Washington Post and the New York Times, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=694.04s)]
*  Bill Mollugin doesn't think that he works for Joe Biden. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=696.08s)]
*  He's taking pictures of what's actually happening. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=699.04s)]
*  And that's wrong. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=702.12s)]
*  What's interesting, given what is happening, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=704.24s)]
*  which is that we are being invaded [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=707.16s)]
*  by people with no right to be here [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=708.76s)]
*  for reasons that we don't really understand, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=710.4399999999999s)]
*  is that none of the people who are complaining [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=714.6s)]
*  about Ron DeSantis sending 50 Venezuelans to Martha's Vineyard [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=716.76s)]
*  have said a word about what else is happening on the border. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  And a lot is happening. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  It's an ongoing humanitarian disaster, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=725.0s)]
*  a tragedy for the people being trafficked [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=727.3199999999999s)]
*  and they are being trafficked. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=729.48s)]
*  But it's also an ongoing disaster for us who live here. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=731.4399999999999s)]
*  It's our country. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=733.68s)]
*  As Mollugin reported, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=735.56s)]
*  human traffickers are loading more than a dozen people [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=736.48s)]
*  into the backs of cars right now, which is a disaster. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=738.88s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  In Uvalde, Fox News was with Texas DPS troopers [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=744.4s)]
*  as they pulled over a human smuggler from Michigan. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=747.48s)]
*  Hidden inside his trunk, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=752.12s)]
*  two illegal immigrants from Honduras, all of them arrested. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  And in Kinney County, Texas DPS troopers [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=757.88s)]
*  pulled over this van and were shocked [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=760.64s)]
*  when they found 16 illegal immigrants [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=762.96s)]
*  being smuggled in the back. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=765.4000000000001s)]
*  So it's a human wave. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=769.0s)]
*  And that's not an attack on the people coming over here. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  They are being rewarded by the Biden administration [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=773.32s)]
*  in exchange for breaking our laws, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  for mocking our constitution. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=777.6800000000001s)]
*  They're being rewarded with public benefits. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=780.12s)]
*  So why wouldn't they come? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=782.72s)]
*  But the volume of this is without precedent [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  in American history. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=788.12s)]
*  And you have to ask yourself, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=789.2s)]
*  what does this mean for the country? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  It's obviously destabilizing, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=793.0400000000001s)]
*  but what does it mean for the people who are coming over here? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  It's obviously destabilizing, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=797.88s)]
*  but what does it mean long-term for the country? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, just to give you some perspective on the numbers here, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=802.1199999999999s)]
*  as Neil Monroe at Breitbart has reported, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=806.68s)]
*  in a given year, roughly three migrants arriving [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=808.4799999999999s)]
*  for every four Americans who were born in this country. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=812.0s)]
*  Three migrants for every four Americans born. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=815.52s)]
*  Oh, remember the great replacement theory? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  Was it conspiracy theory? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=822.3599999999999s)]
*  It sounds more like a statistical fact, actually. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=824.52s)]
*  But did they get to vote on this? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=827.84s)]
*  Do people want this? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  Democracy, remember that? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=831.76s)]
*  That's where people vote, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=833.24s)]
*  and they get to decide what kind of government they get [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=834.08s)]
*  and what sort of policies that government enacts. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=836.2800000000001s)]
*  No, no, no one voted on this. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  Nobody wants this. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=840.24s)]
*  It's happening anyway, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=841.08s)]
*  against the will of the entire country. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=842.2800000000001s)]
*  So what did Biden say about this? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=844.12s)]
*  Well, here's what he said today. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=845.2800000000001s)]
*  On the border, why is the border more overwhelmed [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=847.12s)]
*  under your watch, Mr. President? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  Because there are three countries that are never... [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=851.36s)]
*  There are fewer immigrants coming from Central America [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  and from Mexico. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=858.92s)]
*  This is a totally different circumstance. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=860.28s)]
*  What's on my watch now is Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=862.4799999999999s)]
*  And the ability to send them back to those states [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=868.0s)]
*  is not rational. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  You could send them back and have them, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=872.8s)]
*  while we're working with Mexico and other countries [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=874.16s)]
*  to see if we can stop the flow. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=876.1999999999999s)]
*  But that's the difference. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=878.04s)]
*  Well, that's just completely insane, of course. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=880.4399999999999s)]
*  They're coming through Mexico [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=883.0799999999999s)]
*  and we control the Mexican economy. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=884.5999999999999s)]
*  We could turn off the Mexican economy in one minute [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=886.4399999999999s)]
*  if we wanted to, of course. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=889.24s)]
*  We're by far their biggest trading partner. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=891.7199999999999s)]
*  And so we have an enormous amount of leverage [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=893.88s)]
*  over the Mexican government. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=895.7199999999999s)]
*  And if we send the Mexican government, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=896.7199999999999s)]
*  not one more crosses through your country in two hours, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=897.8399999999999s)]
*  that'd be the end of it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=901.52s)]
*  Because no one wants to tang with the federales. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=902.64s)]
*  No one takes American law enforcement seriously [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=904.36s)]
*  because they know they're just gonna direct you [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=906.12s)]
*  to the local welfare office. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=907.48s)]
*  Nobody messes with the Mexican federales, period. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=908.52s)]
*  And everyone knows that. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=911.36s)]
*  But we're not doing that. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=912.52s)]
*  What Biden said that is true is that as of this fiscal year, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=914.12s)]
*  migrants in places other than the Northern Triangle countries [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=917.04s)]
*  in Mexico, specifically Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=919.6s)]
*  do make up nearly 40% of the total apprehensions [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=922.6800000000001s)]
*  at the border as of last month. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=925.52s)]
*  That's a 175% jump from last year. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=927.4s)]
*  What Biden didn't say, of course, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=930.6800000000001s)]
*  is that it's all his fault. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=932.16s)]
*  He's solely responsible for this. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=933.36s)]
*  He stopped deporting asylum seekers [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=935.36s)]
*  and he's allowing asylum seekers with fraudulent claims [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=937.48s)]
*  to remain in this country. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=939.6s)]
*  And of course, the message has gone out to the world. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=940.92s)]
*  Just show up and you'll be fine. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=942.76s)]
*  So let's say you wanted to harm the United States. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=945.76s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=948.8s)]
*  Well, what did Fidel Castro do in 1980 [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=950.0s)]
*  with the Mariel Boatlift? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=952.4799999999999s)]
*  He opened his prisons and mental hospitals [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  and sent them to Miami, thereby changing Miami forever. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=955.36s)]
*  Venezuela is doing something very similar. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=958.8s)]
*  Venezuela is opening its prisons and sending them here. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=961.4799999999999s)]
*  Breitbart reports tonight that DHS [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=964.8s)]
*  is warning border officials to be on the lookout [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=966.4s)]
*  for Venezuelan convicts entering the country. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=968.48s)]
*  DHS indicates that, quote, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=971.4000000000001s)]
*  the Venezuelan government is purposely freeing inmates, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=973.0s)]
*  including some convicted of murder, rape and extortion. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=976.08s)]
*  This is unbelievable. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=980.2800000000001s)]
*  Again, we've seen this before and it's a catastrophe. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=982.5200000000001s)]
*  Again, during the Carter administration, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=986.32s)]
*  Fidel Castro's government, the Cuban government, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=988.36s)]
*  did the very same thing. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=991.12s)]
*  125,000 people came to Florida. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=993.0400000000001s)]
*  A Sun Sentinel article from 1985 [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=997.88s)]
*  estimated that out of the 125,000 migrants who came [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=999.72s)]
*  at the time, 16 to 20,000 were criminals. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  The Miami district director for immigration [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1007.1600000000001s)]
*  called it an invasion, quote, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1008.8000000000001s)]
*  the boat list should never been allowed to happen. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1010.44s)]
*  At any other time, it would have been an act of war. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1012.44s)]
*  And Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas at the time, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
*  said exactly the same thing, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1017.88s)]
*  but a lot has changed since 1985. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1019.2800000000001s)]
*  No one in the federal government will admit what this is, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1021.24s)]
*  which is an invasion. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1023.0400000000001s)]
*  And of course, the media are totally for it [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1024.08s)]
*  because, hey, cheap housekeepers. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1026.04s)]
*  So law enforcement authorities, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1028.24s)]
*  rather than doing anything [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1030.48s)]
*  about the people invading our country, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1032.08s)]
*  are talking about prosecuting Ron DeSantis. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1033.36s)]
*  As we understand it, 48 migrants were lured, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1037.0s)]
*  I will use the word lured, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1041.2s)]
*  under false pretenses into staying at a hotel [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1043.12s)]
*  for a couple of days. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1047.68s)]
*  They were taken by airplane. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1049.44s)]
*  At a certain point, they were shuttled to an airplane [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1051.52s)]
*  where they were flown to Florida [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1054.48s)]
*  and then eventually flown to Martha's Vineyard. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1056.56s)]
*  Again, under false pretenses is the information that we have [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1059.0s)]
*  that they were promised work, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1062.48s)]
*  they were promised the solution to several of their problems. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1063.8s)]
*  We do have the names of some suspects involved [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1066.28s)]
*  that we believe are persons of interest [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1068.68s)]
*  in this case at this point, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  but I won't be parting with those names. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1071.48s)]
*  I think to be fair, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1073.68s)]
*  I think everybody on this call [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1075.8s)]
*  knows who those names are already, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1077.0s)]
*  so I won't be naming any of them. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1078.32s)]
*  That's appalling and shocking. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1081.4s)]
*  For any law enforcement official, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1083.2s)]
*  a guy who carries a gun and has a right to shoot you, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1084.8400000000001s)]
*  to be parroting by administration [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1087.68s)]
*  political talking points in front of a camera, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1090.6000000000001s)]
*  that man should be ashamed. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1093.16s)]
*  That is completely over the top [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1095.3200000000002s)]
*  that he would say something like this. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1097.0800000000002s)]
*  This is all crazy. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1098.24s)]
*  We're being invaded, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1099.4s)]
*  and now they're talking about prosecuting Ron DeSantis [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1101.0800000000002s)]
*  because he sent 50 people to Martha's Vineyard [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1104.64s)]
*  who immediately deported so they wouldn't get in the way [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1106.44s)]
*  of the Food and Wine Festival? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1107.96s)]
*  True craziness. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLI2LWcO6Cc&t=1110.0s)]
