# Civil rights Icon: White America can't solve problems of Black America
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [October 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg)
*  We actively seek out people who will tell the truth on this subject. There aren't many. Bob Woodson is one of them. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=0.0s)]
*  He's of course a civil rights icon, a frequent guest on this show, and we're delighted to have him join us tonight. Mr. Woodson, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=6.16s)]
*  thanks so much for coming on. Why won't- Thanks for having me, Tucker. It's so obvious what's happening. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=10.8s)]
*  It's been going on for 50 years. If there's one thing that's wrecked the country, it's this. Why won't anybody say it? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=15.48s)]
*  Well, because it's not politically correct to say that, because they're buying into the race, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=23.5s)]
*  the whole race theory that somehow the problems that black America faces today is a legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=29.1s)]
*  and it's patently not true. And we at the Woodson Center have demonstrated this with Delano, who is a part of our group too, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=38.94s)]
*  with just wonderful statement. But in fact, dads are stepping up, and they have been around the country. We saw this in Louisiana [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  when kids were fighting in their schools for three days, and they were arrested. These black dads didn't go to the school [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=54.74s)]
*  and demand that teachers receive DEI training. Instead, they said, these are our children destroying one another [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=65.74s)]
*  and destroying their future. We have the responsibility and the obligation to respond. So five of them got together [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=72.74s)]
*  and went into the school, and then it soon expanded to 40 men. And these dads are patrolling the schools, going to classes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=80.05999999999999s)]
*  They work with local law enforcement to make sure that the dads were screened going in. It's a part of a movement, Tucker, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  that's been going on for a number of years. The Woodson Center has supported groups like this. In fact, we spent about $500,000 [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=96.86s)]
*  giving $5,000 grants to grassroots groups like this dad's group in the country. I'm just pleased that they're getting [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=104.86s)]
*  the kind of public recognition that they need. And what they need, though, is more rewards. They need rewards. We need to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  shift some of the money that's being wasted by corporations on Black Lives Matter and spend the money on people inside these [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=124.18s)]
*  communities. The solutions are where the problems are. Well, of course. If you ask any successful, well-adjusted, productive [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=132.18s)]
*  man in this country, what's the secret to your happiness? Most of them will say, you know, my dad had a lot to do with it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=140.18s)]
*  That's just true. Everyone knows it's true. I cannot believe we're ignoring this, but we are because I'm not sure why. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=146.18s)]
*  Well, because it's not politically correct. I think the radical left has been using Black America as a political tool. And [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=154.18s)]
*  they are exploiting the whole race issue for their own gain. And so the only way that that's going to change and be challenged [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=164.18s)]
*  is to allow Black America to speak for themselves. And that's what the Woodson Center is doing. We're going to be expanding on our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=172.18s)]
*  Black Lives Matter grants program, and we hope to go out and reach others to convince them that we need to invest in these [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=179.18s)]
*  dads. They recognize that they are willing to be surrogate fathers to hundreds of other children. And so we hope and pray [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=189.18s)]
*  that the country will wake up. Instead of seeing George Soros spend a million dollars in Texas town to promote defund the police, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=197.18s)]
*  we need to invest instead on these grassroots healing agents, not only to heal the community from within. White America can't do a thing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=205.18s)]
*  to solve the problems of Black America. Making white people less racist doesn't make Black people much safer. That they have to be agents of their own uplift. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=216.18s)]
*  Exactly. That's true for everyone. Robert Woodson, thank you very much. Great to see you tonight. Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJSn9u1ztg&t=223.18s)]
