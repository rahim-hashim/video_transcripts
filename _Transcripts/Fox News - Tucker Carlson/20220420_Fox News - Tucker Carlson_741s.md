# Tucker: Biden has not been able to think clearly for years now
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, if you've seen video of Joe Biden [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  mumbling in public recently, and we bet you have, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=5.24s)]
*  there's probably not anything we could tell you tonight, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=8.28s)]
*  excuse me, that's gonna surprise you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=10.74s)]
*  Would you be shocked to learn that Joe Biden [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  recently got lost in his own bedroom? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=14.98s)]
*  That he introduced a table lamp as his wife? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=17.02s)]
*  That he bragged to the Japanese Prime Minister [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=20.18s)]
*  about saving Marie Antoinette's life [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=22.42s)]
*  during a cavalry charge in the Crimean War? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=24.5s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  Now, we can't say that any of these things [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=28.58s)]
*  actually happened, but they could have, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=30.18s)]
*  they're entirely plausible. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=32.46s)]
*  And if you think that's a mean thing to say, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=34.62s)]
*  don't worry, Joe Biden will never know. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=35.82s)]
*  At this point, other people are not real to Joe Biden. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=37.42s)]
*  He lives in a world of ghosts and fog-shrouded memories. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=39.62s)]
*  But you knew that because you've seen the tape. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=42.66s)]
*  Maybe the only thing that would surprise you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=44.8s)]
*  about Joe Biden 15 months into his presidency [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=46.8s)]
*  is learning that he plans to run for reelection. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=49.84s)]
*  Now, that would be outlandish, impossible, really, ridiculous. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=52.58s)]
*  Were Joe Biden somehow able to stay in the White House, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=56.900000000000006s)]
*  he would be 86 years old by the end of his second term. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=60.0s)]
*  Do the math on that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=63.68s)]
*  Even now, at 79, past the life expectancy [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=65.54s)]
*  of the average American man, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=68.84s)]
*  Joe Biden can barely speak English. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=70.26s)]
*  And that is not a trend that will improve with time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=71.92s)]
*  What kind of president would Joe Biden be by the year 2028? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=74.88s)]
*  You shudder to think about that, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=79.5s)]
*  but you can bet that more Botox and hair plugs [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=81.12s)]
*  would not improve him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=83.30000000000001s)]
*  The whole idea is grotesque, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=84.97999999999999s)]
*  weekend at Bernie's White House edition. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=86.72s)]
*  It's an insult to the principle of self-government. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=88.88s)]
*  But that doesn't mean it's not coming. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=92.16s)]
*  According to a piece this week in the Hill newspaper, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=94.16s)]
*  Joe Biden has confided in his old boss, Barack Obama, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=96.5s)]
*  that he does, in fact, plan to run for reelection. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden believes he is, quote, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=103.46s)]
*  the only one who can beat Donald Trump, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=104.96s)]
*  which, if nothing else, suggests that Joe Biden [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  believes he beat Donald Trump the first time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=109.89999999999999s)]
*  Hey, guys, I got 81 million votes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'll get 500 billion next time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=113.8s)]
*  So how did Barack Obama respond to that? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=116.7s)]
*  Well, the Hill newspaper didn't say. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=118.58s)]
*  We do know that earlier this month, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=120.34s)]
*  Obama referred to Joe Biden as, quote, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=121.58s)]
*  vice president, so you can guess. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=123.3s)]
*  Obama never hid the fact that he didn't like [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=126.02s)]
*  or respect Joe Biden. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=128.12s)]
*  Obama thought Biden was fake and incompetent, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=129.78s)]
*  old, white, and annoying, and that was 10 years ago. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=132.12s)]
*  So you can imagine how Obama feels [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=135.54s)]
*  about the prospect of an 86-year-old president, Joe Biden. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=137.54s)]
*  Now, Michelle Obama, by contrast, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=141.3s)]
*  has just turned 60 by the time [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=143.06s)]
*  the next presidential election rolls around, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=144.9s)]
*  so clearly it's her turn. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=146.58s)]
*  It's not just Obama who feels this way. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=148.46s)]
*  A lot of Democrats agree. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=150.02s)]
*  Just for the sake of amusement this morning, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=152.74s)]
*  we tried to find a Democratic Party official [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  who'd be willing to go on the record [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=157.8s)]
*  to endorse a second Joe Biden candidacy, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=159.22s)]
*  and we couldn't find a single one. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=161.66000000000003s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, these are the same people [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=164.02s)]
*  who are delighted to tell you [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=166.62s)]
*  that you can change your biological sex [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=168.3s)]
*  just by wishing it so. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  Like Dorothy clicking her heels at Oz. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=172.18s)]
*  Boom, you're transgender now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=174.22s)]
*  They consider that believable. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=175.78s)]
*  Yet they will not tell you [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=178.56s)]
*  that Joe Biden should be president again. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=179.8s)]
*  A Biden re-election campaign [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=181.82s)]
*  is just too absurd even for them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=183.22s)]
*  It strains credulity past the breaking point. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden? Come on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=187.88s)]
*  That's the consensus in Washington tonight, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=190.06s)]
*  and for once, it is correct. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  So given that, now you know [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  what is going on with the news media. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=197.06s)]
*  Joe Biden's most loyal constituency [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  has turned on him with a vengeance. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=201.02s)]
*  After getting the mannequin elected, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  the White House press corps is telling you [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=205.06s)]
*  night after night, he's a loser. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  Why are they saying this? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  Because they don't want him to run again. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=209.82000000000002s)]
*  They know he will lose. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  Watch CNN remind you that Joe Biden [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  is now less popular [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=215.02s)]
*  than most sexually transmitted diseases. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  These numbers kind of differ. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=219.18s)]
*  They range from the low 30s to the low 40s. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=220.34s)]
*  Low 40s is not good either. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  But what's key is the lowest are tied [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=224.38s)]
*  for the low for the pollster. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=226.96s)]
*  Lowest tier, lowest tier. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  This is one point off the lowest, lowest tier. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=230.02s)]
*  And when you have three or four pollsters [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=232.62s)]
*  showing the lowest numbers [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=234.46s)]
*  for the president of the United States, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=236.12s)]
*  that is indicative of a president [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=237.5s)]
*  who's in a lot of trouble, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=239.5s)]
*  at least to where he is, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=240.78s)]
*  standing historically. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=241.82000000000002s)]
*  This is the lowest for anyone [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  who was elected to the presidency [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=244.34s)]
*  and didn't get up there through the vice presidency. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=245.78s)]
*  This is a really, really, really bad number. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=247.8s)]
*  Okay, so that's one piece of tape, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=252.72s)]
*  but it's not just a single oily poll reader on CNN. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=254.78s)]
*  Pretty much every media outlet in the country [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=257.66s)]
*  is saying the same thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=260.66s)]
*  So they've gone beyond reading the terrible poll numbers [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=262.14s)]
*  and now they're agreeing with the terrible poll numbers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=264.82s)]
*  Here's Chief Biden toady, Chuck Todd of NBC, quote, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=267.18s)]
*  news turning on his former patron live on television. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=270.54s)]
*  It's like a scene from the Godfather. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=274.74s)]
*  Ooh, the betrayal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=276.3s)]

*  to showcase Joe Biden's strengths [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=565.66s)]
*  and his fundamental awesomeness. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=567.9s)]
*  Now imagine what he must be like around the office, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=570.2199999999999s)]
*  where there are no cameras or special injections [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=572.62s)]
*  from the White House physicians to clear his head. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=574.7399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's gotta be Thanksgiving at the rest home, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=577.66s)]
*  with Biden sitting alone making designs [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=579.7399999999999s)]
*  in his mashed potatoes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=581.5799999999999s)]
*  His coworkers are clearly worn out by this, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=583.14s)]
*  if not affirmatively sick of the whole thing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=585.06s)]
*  Watch what happened at the White House earlier this month, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=587.9s)]
*  and remember, as you view this, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=590.2199999999999s)]
*  that virtually everyone in the room works for Joe Biden, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=591.78s)]
*  but they're ignoring him anyway. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=595.42s)]
*  So that's the polite version of what happened that day. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=600.9399999999999s)]
*  Here's the scene moments later with Barack Obama, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  the rudest president in American history. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=606.62s)]
*  Obama never liked Joe Biden, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=609.5s)]
*  and he's hardly gonna start pretending to now. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=611.02s)]
*  We should warn you, this is horrible. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=613.3s)]
*  How are you? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=616.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=617.4599999999999s)]
*  How are you? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=618.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=619.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=620.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=621.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=622.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=623.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=624.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=625.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=626.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=627.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=628.4599999999999s)]
*  Who's crying like that? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=629.7800000000001s)]
*  We could play clip after clip after clip like that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=650.1s)]
*  We've got a whole montage with Joe Biden referring [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=652.98s)]
*  as the President of the United States. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=655.34s)]
*  Spoiler alert, she's not. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=657.94s)]
*  The whole thing is depressing. You get it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=659.3s)]
*  Everyone gets it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=661.5s)]
*  The Democratic Party installed Joe Biden [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=663.06s)]
*  in a last desperate effort [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=664.9799999999999s)]
*  to stop the economic populism of Bernie Sanders, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=666.38s)]
*  and then in the general election, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=668.66s)]
*  in an effort to silence the uncontrollable [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=670.42s)]
*  talking of Donald Trump. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=672.9799999999999s)]
*  To be clear, permanent Washington [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=675.26s)]
*  never feared what Donald Trump would do. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=676.66s)]
*  It was pretending to fear that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  What actually legitimately terrified them [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=681.06s)]
*  was what Donald Trump might say. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=683.66s)]
*  What if Trump started noting obvious things [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=686.0999999999999s)]
*  and then the whole system came tumbling down? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=688.58s)]
*  That could happen. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=690.5400000000001s)]
*  Words are the one thing you can't take back. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=692.0200000000001s)]
*  So it was not worth the risk to keep Trump. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=693.9000000000001s)]
*  It absolutely had to be Joe Biden. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=696.1800000000001s)]
*  They assumed Joe Biden would be grateful for the promotion, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=698.62s)]
*  a ceremonial retirement gig, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=700.82s)]
*  one last government sinecure before the end. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=702.94s)]
*  But somewhere along the way, things changed, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=705.5s)]
*  as they often do. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=707.62s)]
*  Joe Biden forgot the terms of the deal. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=708.98s)]
*  He started running up to microphones [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=711.38s)]
*  and pretending to be president. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=712.94s)]
*  At a certain point, the kabuki went to his head, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=714.6600000000001s)]
*  and then he decided he might actually run for reelection. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=716.98s)]
*  What the hell? I got 81 million votes the first time. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=719.74s)]
*  For the Democratic Party, this was disaster. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=724.62s)]
*  Frankenstein had escaped the lab, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=726.4200000000001s)]
*  so they had to take him out, and now they are. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC2rRw_Z7HE&t=728.86s)]
