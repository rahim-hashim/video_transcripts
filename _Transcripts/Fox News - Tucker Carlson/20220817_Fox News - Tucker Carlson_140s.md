# Is the 'Last White Man' novel 'liberal pornography'?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40)
*  Pedro Gonzalez is associate editor at Chronicles. He joins us tonight. Pedro, this seems like kind [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=0.0s)]
*  of a sea change. You didn't used to be allowed to say, I hate an entire race of people and hope for [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=5.68s)]
*  their extinction. Wired magazine wouldn't kind of have your back on that, but now they do. What is this? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=10.08s)]
*  Right. Well, it's a new phenomenon that goes just beyond books, but I think it's important to actually [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=16.4s)]
*  do an overview of The Last White Man. Basically, the characters suffer through these apocalyptic [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=22.16s)]
*  changes as violence escalates, as whites disappear. Pale skinned militants in woodland camos stalk the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=27.2s)]
*  streets, attacking people with impunity from the cops. But a calm settles upon the world once [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=35.12s)]
*  whites disappear from its face forever. A book like this, which is somewhere between racial [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=41.92s)]
*  exterminationist literature with a kind of wistful touch and liberal pornography, could only be [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=48.96s)]
*  written about one group, and that privilege is reserved for whites. There's a whole industry for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=55.2s)]
*  this stuff, Tucker, and there are no shortage of eager consumers who eat this stuff up because they [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=60.56s)]
*  believe truly that there's no limit to the amount of demeaning that we can inflict on whites. And [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=67.12s)]
*  again, it goes beyond bad books like The Last White Man. And I'll give you a different but related [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=73.12s)]
*  example of this phenomenon. The Minneapolis Public Schools and Local Teachers Union have recently [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=79.2s)]
*  instituted a new policy in which when it comes to downsizing and layoffs, the rule is white teachers [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=85.68s)]
*  must be laid off before any teacher of color. In other words, they've codified racial discrimination [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=92.64s)]
*  against whites in real life, not in fiction. In an age where we talk a whole lot about discrimination [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  and hate speech, we've actually formally instituted it in the United States against the group who we [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=105.12s)]
*  blame for this stuff, and that is obviously white people. Yeah, I mean, racism doesn't ever end well, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  and at this scale it will end very badly, and I hope they stop it immediately. It's beyond belief. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=120.72s)]
*  Patrick Gonzales, I appreciate the clarity of that. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=125.44s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. We hope you are changing the world and changing your life. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=135.12s)]
*  From Dr. Carlson tonight. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ8coFTtG40&t=138.16s)]
