# US has already started war with Russia: Former CIA officer
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ)
*  Most Americans deeply sympathize with the people of Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  They got invaded. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=3.84s)]
*  Who wouldn't sympathize with them? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=5.44s)]
*  So our Congress and our executive branch have been busy shoveling armaments to the government [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=7.62s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=12.34s)]
*  And again, no one's questioning anyone's motives here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=13.34s)]
*  But if you're going to accelerate a conflict in Eastern Europe, you have to wonder what [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=16.64s)]
*  the consequences might be. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=22.32s)]
*  What would it mean if the United States was sucked into a war with Russia? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=24.62s)]
*  Well that's one of the questions we asked the other day to Congresswoman Maria Salazar [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=29.92s)]
*  of Florida. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=33.52s)]
*  She's the one who refused to rule out imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=34.84s)]
*  In fact, called for it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=38.08s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=39.32s)]
*  My position is that we should not take the no-fly zone off the table. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=40.32s)]
*  But before that, that's two. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=46.44s)]
*  We need to do one. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=48.28s)]
*  And one is to give Zelensky exactly what he's asking for. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  No troops on the ground. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=53.0s)]
*  Let's give him the MiG-3 and the S-300 what he needs to defend his own airspace. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=54.72s)]
*  So he will create his own no-fly zone. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=61.2s)]
*  So if you're starting to get the impression that the people formulating our foreign policy [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=65.88s)]
*  have no freaking clue what they're talking about and haven't thought past, say, tonight [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=71.56s)]
*  in the implications of what they're recommending, you may be on to something. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=76.36s)]
*  There are a lot of deeply ignorant, reckless people, even some of them motivated by perfectly [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=80.88s)]
*  noble impulses, who are running things. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  So now may be the time to pause and ask what would it mean to enter into a hot war with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=89.86s)]
*  Russia? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Brian Dean Wright is a former CIA operations officer. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=97.0s)]
*  He's thought a lot about that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=99.8s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  Brian, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  So this is one of those questions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=104.16s)]
*  I think the public has a right to determine what it thinks of this and make that decision [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=106.64s)]
*  on the basis of all available facts. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=112.84s)]
*  So I'd just be interested in asking what you think. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  How close are we to an open war with Russia and what would that mean for the United States? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  Great questions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  It gets worse every day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=128.08s)]
*  The possibility of a hot war are real and getting more real every day. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=129.08s)]
*  Look, what I'm asking Americans to do tonight is put aside their hatred for Putin or Zelensky [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=133.84s)]
*  for that matter, or Ukraine or Russia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=139.64s)]
*  Put all that aside for a moment. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=141.68s)]
*  Understand that we have in effect declared war against Russia. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=144.04s)]
*  We have done three things. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=147.52s)]
*  One, we have crippled their economy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=148.6s)]
*  Two, we are shoving in all these weapons. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=150.64s)]
*  And third, this hasn't gotten a lot of press. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=153.36s)]
*  We are giving tactical intelligence to the Ukrainian government to put an X on the forehead [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=156.32s)]
*  of a Russian soldier and Russian equipment. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=161.16s)]
*  Let me say that a little differently. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=163.84s)]
*  Our spies and our satellites are helping the Ukrainians kill Russians. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=165.76s)]
*  So we have declared war. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=171.44s)]
*  So we should be asking, shouldn't we, what's that war going to look like, to your point? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=173.3s)]
*  And indeed, we should start with the first place of, well, who's actually putting together [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=178.0s)]
*  our war response? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=181.24s)]
*  Well, we know that the folks of the Pentagon are the ones who are primarily responsible [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=182.72s)]
*  for that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=187.9s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=188.9s)]
*  They just got us out of a 20-year war, didn't they? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=190.18s)]
*  Or actually, they kept us in one and we lost it to goat herders. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=192.46s)]
*  OK? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  Now we have folks on Capitol Hill and the White House who were also around for 20 years, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  and they were the ones who were formulating the policies that also lost that war. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  So the people who are now formulating our response to a nuclear-armed Russia are the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=207.02s)]
*  same ones who couldn't figure out how to beat goat herders in Afghanistan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=211.46s)]
*  That should cause everyone a very real degree of concern, and we should be asking each other [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=216.1s)]
*  about it and we should be talking about it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  So then the second question becomes, if in fact this gets hot, what happens? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=223.32s)]
*  We know that it will escalate, and so that means some of the first steps will be what [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=227.66s)]
*  are called asymmetric, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=231.06s)]
*  Russia can't sanction our economy in the way that we did his, so he's going to do things [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=232.66s)]
*  like a cyber attack. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  I want people to ask themselves tonight, what if in their hometown Russia were to shut off [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=238.82s)]
*  the lights or the water? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=243.38s)]
*  Do you think there might be riots? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=245.54s)]
*  Probably. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=247.38s)]
*  You brought forward this very horrific idea and notion tonight in Brooklyn of the places [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=248.74s)]
*  of bread lines. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=252.78s)]
*  Do you think that could get violent? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=253.78s)]
*  Of course it could. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=255.12s)]
*  So how would people's mayors and governors respond to riots? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=256.5s)]
*  We saw it a couple years ago. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=260.54s)]
*  Does that give you pause? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=261.54s)]
*  Seeing the BLM riots? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=262.54s)]
*  That should also give you a pause. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=263.54s)]
*  So we have a whole variety of issues about the sacrifice that will go on. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=266.32s)]
*  That's a whole different segment, but it involves young people dying, and we should [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=271.4s)]
*  also be talking about that because our people in Washington aren't going to be the ones [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=275.12s)]
*  sacrificing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  But they are the ones who feel virtuous by doing all of this stuff and damn the consequences. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=280.64s)]
*  I see a pattern, a recurring theme here, and I'm just grateful for the clarity you provided. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=284.64s)]
*  Brian Deanwright, I hope you'll come back. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=290.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=293.76s)]
*  You bet. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=294.76s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTqph3cdgQ&t=295.76s)]
