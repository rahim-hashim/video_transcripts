# Charlie Gasparino: The Biden admin won't admit this
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ)
*  So in just the past two years, the Federal Reserve has increased the money supply in the United States by more than 40% in two years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=0.0s)]
*  During the COVID pandemic, the Fed bought up more than five trillion dollars worth of mortgage back in government securities. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  The Treasury Department also borrowed trillions of dollars for stimulus checks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=16.02s)]
*  So what was the effect of that? Well, it was historic levels of inflation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=20.32s)]
*  Can they admit that? If not, why not? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=24.72s)]
*  Charlie Gasparino has followed this from the beginning, a senior correspondent, of course, at Fox Business, a prolific business journalist for many decades. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=26.4s)]
*  We're happy to have him on tonight. Charlie, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=33.44s)]
*  So it seems I mean, I'm not an economist, but even I can see the connection between higher spending and inflation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Why can't they just admit that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=42.84s)]
*  The Biden administration won't admit it. Wall Street is grudgingly admitting it after being behind it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=45.08s)]
*  You know, you hear people like Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink and everybody say, wow, you know, maybe we kept the pedal to the metal too long. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  And now we're paying the price. The unfortunate thing is that it's not Wall Street that is paying the price here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=58.36s)]
*  It's average Americans. I mean, here's the thing. I grew up in the 70s. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure you remember the 70s a little bit. Yes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=66.12s)]
*  My old man worked three jobs and he worked three jobs because working class people couldn't afford, you know, everything, putting their kids to school, buying them clothes, sneakers, whatever. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=68.44s)]
*  And the mortgage, when inflation is raging and it's a it's a it's a heinous tax on the on the working class and it's always propagated by by elites on Wall Street and in any government. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=77.28s)]
*  So now we're in a pickle. Like, how do you get out of it? And it's it's there's no good choices here because the Biden administration won't help the supply side of the of the equation, which means how you increase supply to meet the demand. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  They won't cut regulations. That would be a smart thing to do. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=100.0s)]
*  You don't have to cut taxes, cut some regulations, be a little more pro-business friendly. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=102.92s)]
*  They won't do that. So all you have is really the heavy hammer and it's a sledgehammer of consistent Fed rate increases. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=107.72s)]
*  Now, you know, markets liked a 75 basis point increase as opposed to a full point. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=114.0s)]
*  However, how many more of these 75 basis points are we going to have to deal with? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  And for how long? If we don't get rid of inflation, this thing could be going on until next year if inflation doesn't go away. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=125.08s)]
*  And that will be a slow grind on the economy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=130.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we really got ourselves in a pickle here. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=132.6s)]
*  Very quick. Almost all of the business titans that you know and cover and have for so long supported Joe Biden. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  Do they regret it? Do you think they do now? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the thing is that they did not think he would he was this incompetent. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=145.92s)]
*  You know, I guess that's the easiest way to say they did not think he would fill his cabinet with far left people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, they thought it would be much more. Listen, this is further to the left than Barack Obama's cabinet. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=158.2s)]
*  Larry Summers had a place in Barack Obama. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't have a place with Joe Biden. You know, no, that's that's a really perfect example of it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  Charlie Esperman, great to see you tonight. Thank you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=172.0s)]
*  Anytime. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5Znb80QQ&t=173.56s)]
