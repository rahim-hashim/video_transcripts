# Tucker laughs at Politico following 'news story' about him
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek)
*  Now, no matter how cynical you are about the media, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=0.0s)]
*  and you ought to be pretty cynical, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=2.16s)]
*  it may not have occurred to you [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  that they're literally for sale. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=4.48s)]
*  The national news media can be bought, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=6.2s)]
*  give them enough money and they will cover you favorably. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Then they will attack anyone who disagrees with you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=10.92s)]
*  But that is of course true. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=13.08s)]
*  And the stories around FTX, the crypto scam and Pfizer [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=15.24s)]
*  show that very clearly. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=20.54s)]
*  So if you ask journalists about this, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=22.48s)]
*  usually they seem, well, ashamed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=23.84s)]
*  because that's prostitution, not journalism. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=26.8s)]
*  But Politico, which is a left-wing political blog [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  in Washington is not ashamed at all. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=32.6s)]
*  If you send Politico enough money, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  they will run your ads and then publish stories [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=37.3s)]
*  attacking anyone who criticizes you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=40.4s)]
*  without disclosing their conflict of interest at any point. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=42.7s)]
*  Now they've been doing this for quite some time. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=45.64s)]
*  It's an open secret in Washington. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=47.0s)]
*  They're not the only ones who do it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=48.08s)]
*  But we just noticed because they attacked us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=49.68s)]
*  Just the other day, they wrote a piece called [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=52.36s)]
*  Why Whale Deaths Are Dividing Environmentalists [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=53.92s)]
*  and Firing Up Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=56.36s)]
*  As if you have to be some kind of right-winger [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=58.1s)]
*  to care about the unexplained deaths [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=59.86s)]
*  of the biggest mammals on earth. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=61.4s)]
*  Lots of whales die, it's fair to ask why. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  But shut up, says Politico. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=64.78s)]
*  We have no idea why a dozen whales just turned up dead [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=67.78s)]
*  on the beaches of New Jersey. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  Does it have anything to do with the construction [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=72.54s)]
*  of wind turbines off the coast? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=73.78s)]
*  That's speculation, Politico reports. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=75.44s)]
*  Probably climate change. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=78.26s)]
*  So the story was ridiculous, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  but what we didn't get at first [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=81.9s)]
*  was that Politico was paid to run it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=83.38s)]
*  Politico is taking a lot of money [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  from the corporations who manufacture [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=88.66s)]
*  and profit from commercial wind turbines. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=91.42s)]
*  Politico has been running this ad [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  on behalf of the Danish wind power company Orsted. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=97.28s)]
*  It appears on Politico's website. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=100.1s)]
*  It looks like a news article, but it's not. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=101.94s)]
*  No, it's an ad. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=104.46s)]
*  You wouldn't know, you're not supposed to know. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=105.36s)]
*  It's supposed to fool you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  Here's the headline. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=107.86s)]
*  Offshore wind, the green energy panacea with some hurdles. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  Oh, what, just a few are like killing all the whales. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=112.86s)]
*  No problem, just a little hurdle. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=114.74s)]
*  That's how the fake article begins. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=116.46s)]
*  Quote, the EU will have to dramatically boost [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=117.74s)]
*  its production of renewable energy [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  to meet its green deal targets. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=121.17999999999999s)]
*  Enter offshore wind. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's the news story of Politico. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  They're prostitutes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=128.54s)]
*  And they're not even ashamed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=130.62s)]
*  So we reached out to them today and asked, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=132.4s)]
*  well, why didn't you disclose the fact that you're a hooker? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=134.14s)]
*  Sorry, that you're taking money [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=137.66s)]
*  from offshore wind turbine manufacturers [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=139.34s)]
*  in your article about offshore wind turbines. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=143.7s)]
*  They don't want to answer that question. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  Oh, shut up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=151.14s)]
*  Subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGVla3ooek&t=152.45999999999998s)]
