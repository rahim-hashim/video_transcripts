# Here's why crime rates are continuing to climb across America
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [August 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0)
*  Larry Elder joins us now. He is a former candidate for California governor, the one we would have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  voted for. He's the host of Larry Elder's show on the Epoch Times. Happy to see him. Larry, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  thanks so much for coming on. So why don't, I mean, you live in a state and you tried to fix it [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=10.64s)]
*  yourself, but you live in a state where stores can't stay open because they're being looted. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=16.72s)]
*  I don't ever hear officeholders even mention this. Well, Tucker, excellent monologue as usual. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=23.2s)]
*  Three broad themes. The first is let's talk about the police. The police in city after city, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=29.68s)]
*  whether it's L.A., whether it's Chicago, whether it's New York, they are demoralized by this lie [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=34.72s)]
*  that they are engaging in systemic racism against minorities, that they're using deadly force [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=39.92s)]
*  against minorities just because they're black. And they're no longer engaging in proactive [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=44.32s)]
*  policing. They're not engaging in some form of stop, question, and frisk, which happened under [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  the Giuliani regime in New York that caused a deep, deep decline in crime. Even Mayor Rahm [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=52.8s)]
*  Emanuel, the Democrat mayor of Chicago, even said when he was mayor that the Chicago police [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=58.96s)]
*  had, quote, gone fetal, close quote, meaning they weren't engaging in proactive policing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=63.84s)]
*  The second big theme, of course, is soft on crime policies, soft on crime governors like the one in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=69.36s)]
*  California, soft on crime D.A.s. Gavin Newsom bragged during COVID that he released 8,000 convicted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=74.16s)]
*  felons. Some of them were violent offenders, Tucker, and the odds are that at least half of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=80.32s)]
*  them are going to reoffend. You have these soft on crime policies like Proposition 47 that allows [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=85.6s)]
*  you to steal $950, not just a day, but per store. And if you get caught, they write your ticket as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  a misdemeanor, and you don't go to jail because you got cashless bail. Proposition 57 that allows [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=96.72s)]
*  a bunch of categories of crime to be called nonviolent. And they include assault on a police [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  officer. I kid you not. That's nonviolent. Serial arson, nonviolent. Rape of an intoxicated victim, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  nonviolent. And as a result, you're finding a greater chance that the bad guy doesn't get [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=112.4s)]
*  caught. And when the bad guy knows he's not going to get caught, crime goes up. If he knows he's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=118.4s)]
*  not going to get convicted, crime goes up. If he knows he's not going to get incarcerated, crime [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=122.64s)]
*  goes up. They may be crooks, but they're not stupid. And finally, the one that few people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  like to talk about, and you mentioned it in the monologue, is the breakdown of the family. You [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  said their parents, plural, are not telling them not to steal. That assumes that there are two [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=134.24s)]
*  parents. Often it is the parent or the grandparent. 40% of all kids in America today enter the world, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=139.44s)]
*  Tucker, without a father married to the mother. 70% of black kids, half of all Hispanic kids, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=146.0s)]
*  25% of white kids. And if you enter the world without a father married to the mother, you're [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=151.2s)]
*  many times more likely to drop out of school, commit crime, and end up going to jail. A young [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=155.2s)]
*  black man is eight to 10 times more likely to be murdered than a young white man. In fact, murder [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=160.64s)]
*  is the number one preventable cause of death for young black men, whereas accidents like car accidents [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=166.4s)]
*  and drownings are the number one cause of preventable death for young white men. And a lot of this crime [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=172.0s)]
*  is taking place in the inner city, in the ghettos, and in the barrios where the father is not there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't know why every Republican in the country wouldn't be running on this. I mean, it's just so [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=184.0s)]
*  obvious if this continues, we'll be living in a completely different place that we don't want to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=188.88s)]
*  live in. So why don't they say that out loud? Well, you know, I ran for governor of California, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=192.96s)]
*  as you pointed out. It's one thing to talk about these issues because it was a central [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=198.16s)]
*  tenet of my campaign. But all the media wanted to talk about is whether or not Larry Elder thought [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=202.08s)]
*  2020 was stolen. I said, I'm here to talk about crime. I'm here to talk about bad schools, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=206.24s)]
*  underperforming schools. Yeah, but do you think 2020 was stolen? So I cannot control the filter [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=210.88s)]
*  through which my message goes. They still, ABC, NBC, CNN, LA Times, where I was called the black [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=216.8s)]
*  face of white supremacy, they didn't care that I wanted to talk about crime. They wanted to talk [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=222.4s)]
*  about the fact that I was Republican, that I voted for Trump, and that had Gavin Newsom been recalled, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=226.08s)]
*  it would have been a Republican takeover. That's all they cared about. And Republicans are outnumbered [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=230.16s)]
*  in California, three to one. And California independents and Democrats are conditioned [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=235.12s)]
*  to loathe Republicans. And I don't know what it's going to take. It's going to take, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=239.12s)]
*  like a drug addict, you've got to hit rock bottom. And more and more of this crime is taking place [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=243.76s)]
*  in the suburbs, like Beverly Hills, like Hancock Park. And until and unless it happens, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=247.68s)]
*  we're going to still have the same old policies pushed by the same old people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Make them defend the looting of 7-Eleven at every turn. Can you do, you did this, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=256.8s)]
*  can you defend this? And of course they can. Larry Elder, great to see you. Thank you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs2TMVeJTQ0&t=262.48s)]
