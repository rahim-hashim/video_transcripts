# Tucker: This once respected institution has gone off the rails
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Tonight, happy Friday. If you've been living [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=0.0s)]
*  in America over the past few years, you've definitely had this experience. You wake up [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=5.0s)]
*  one morning and you realize that some institution you grew up with, a group you once loved and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=8.98s)]
*  trusted, has somehow changed completely. It's not what you remember. It's unrecognizable. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=14.98s)]
*  In fact, it's now insane. Chances are that's happened at the school you went to, maybe [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=20.56s)]
*  to the church you grew up in or a charity you've long supported. They're very different. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=26.34s)]
*  If you're an Episcopalian, you know exactly what we're talking about. If you've ever given [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=30.82s)]
*  money to the Sierra Club hoping they'd, I don't know, protect the Sierras, you get it [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=34.14s)]
*  too. So everywhere in this country, formerly respectable organizations seem to have gone [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=38.54s)]
*  off the deep end. Have you listened to national public radio recently? Now admittedly, NPR [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  was always a little nutty, but in a familiar, non-threatening kind of way. Your average [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=50.46s)]
*  public radio station ran niche cultural programming most of the time, the Celtic Music Hour or [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=55.22s)]
*  a bluegrass show. In fact, for decades, public radio's most popular feature was something [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=61.38s)]
*  called Car Talk. Remember that? It was a show where two Italian mechanics from Boston, hilarious, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=66.14s)]
*  both of them, argued about the relative merits of carburetors versus fuel injections. They [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=71.5s)]
*  gave you free advice on how to fix your Honda. And then in the morning and again at night, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=75.42s)]
*  as always, in drive time, all NPR stations aired the news from Washington. There was [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=79.66s)]
*  morning edition in the morning. There was all things considered on the trip home. NPR [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=84.58000000000001s)]
*  anchors were left of center, obviously, but more than anything, they were self-consciously [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=89.7s)]
*  upmarket. They spoke in comically stilted voices designed to suggest deep airy edition. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  You can imagine them reading a lot of Rilke in their spare time and having complicated [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=100.5s)]
*  opinions about wine. This is NPR, they'd say, national public radio. It was all pretty [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  amusing, easy to mock, but it was basically harmless. NPR didn't call for violent revolution [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=112.02s)]
*  or denounce white people as demons. That did happen on some radical stations like Pacifica, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=118.02s)]
*  but not at NPR. At NPR, they were just dopey, self-important, 70-styled liberals, the kind [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=123.02s)]
*  of dangly earrings and composting bins in their yards. Not anymore. You ought to listen [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  to NPR now. Actually, don't listen. We pulled the clips for you. Keep in mind that what [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  you're about to hear is entirely real. All of it aired on NPR over just the last few [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=139.22s)]
*  weeks. First up is a segment about dieting, and that seems like a sensible topic. Obviously, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=144.22s)]
*  the country could use some help dropping weight, particularly with COVID in the air, but NPR [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  doesn't run straightforward segments anymore on anything. So it never occurred to them [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=154.74s)]
*  to air a feature about how to rid yourself of extra Christmas pounds. No, a segment [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=160.06s)]
*  like that would be racist. It has nothing to do with equity or marginalized communities. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=164.62s)]
*  So instead, here's how NPR approached dieting. Listen. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=170.22s)]
*  I am a Chinese-American non-binary therapist and psychologist and DEI consultant. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=174.22s)]
*  Chang specializes in research and treatment of eating disorders within marginalized communities [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=182.22s)]
*  in the Bay Area. They say decoupling from diet culture is often eye-opening and also [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=186.02s)]
*  uncomfortable. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  Decoupling from diet culture. Are you following this? By the way, you can't even have a conversation [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=195.42s)]
*  without certain prerequisites. If you're going to talk about dieting on NPR, you're going [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=200.32s)]
*  to need a Chinese-American non-binary therapist and psychologist and DEI consultant to do [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  it. A mere nutritionist won't cut the mustard. Those are the new rules at NPR. But actually, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=210.1s)]
*  don't talk about dieting at all. Dieting is racist. It's part of white supremacy culture. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=215.14s)]
*  Here's NPR's explanation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=223.14s)]
*  The thing is, the BMI was never meant to measure individual health. And again, was based purely [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=246.14s)]
*  on studies of white men. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=253.14s)]
*  Do they believe any of this? So here's NPR National Public Radio telling you that your [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=256.14s)]
*  weight has nothing to do with your health. It's decoupled, as they might say, from your [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=263.14s)]
*  health. And if you think otherwise, you're engaging in fat phobia. And that means you, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=268.14s)]
*  Mr. American, must ignore the COVID numbers. The numbers that suggest being overweight [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=273.14s)]
*  is in fact a major risk factor for death, in fact the biggest risk factor for death [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=277.14s)]
*  among the young. But keep in mind, those statistics compiled by white men. The real problem with [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=281.14s)]
*  being fat, says NPR, is that you're constantly being oppressed by racist diet culture. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=288.14s)]
*  Entry is limited to an assumed body size. We might consider basic accommodations like [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=303.14s)]
*  doorways or seatbelts as value neutral, but that only shows us how much diet culture has [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=308.14s)]
*  influenced the design of our world. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=312.14s)]
*  We'd love to get Andy Tegel on tonight to explain why the size of doorways is racist. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=316.14s)]
*  Now you're probably thinking at this point, well they just pulled the looniest examples [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=322.14s)]
*  off NPR. Nope. That's a representative sample. What you're hearing there is NPR's approach [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=325.14s)]
*  to every story. So you could do actual reporting on actual trends or stories that are of interest [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=333.14s)]
*  to your audience and have some inherent meaning. No. NPR has decided only to complain about [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=342.14s)]
*  frivolous questions. Listen to this segment in which NPR's news division informs us that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=350.14s)]
*  our long national nightmare is finally over and thank God, Sesame Street has finally hired [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=357.14s)]
*  an Asian American puppet. Watch. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=363.14s)]
*  This year the show welcomed a new character, electric guitar playing Ji Young, the first [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=365.14s)]
*  Asian American puppet in its history. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=371.14s)]
*  I think the sort of genesis of Ji Young was accelerated with the rise in hate crimes against [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=373.14s)]
*  Asians this year. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=379.14s)]
*  Yeah, the rise in hate crimes against Asians committed by all those Trump supporters. That [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=381.14s)]
*  spurred Sesame Street to get an Asian puppet and it spurred NPR to celebrate it. Now this [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=386.14s)]
*  is a big change. If you remember Sesame Street, there was Big Bird and Cookie Monster. They [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=391.14s)]
*  didn't seem to have ethnicities. In fact, that was the point. There was no tribalism [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=397.14s)]
*  on Sesame Street. That's why they used animals, not people. Not anymore. According to NPR, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=402.14s)]
*  the ethnicity of the Sesame Street Muppets is the most important thing and not just on [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=408.14s)]
*  Sesame Street, in all entertainment and art and culture. No one at NPR reads books anymore, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=413.14s)]
*  obviously. They've thrown down the real cut, which they probably never read in the first [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=420.14s)]
*  place. But they do stream a ton of garbage off the internet and when they watch it, they're [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=423.14s)]
*  most interested in what the people look like, the shades of their skin. Here's an NPR producer [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=430.14s)]
*  explaining what he's been watching recently. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=435.14s)]
*  Well, Kamari, what TV show were you binging this year? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=438.14s)]
*  I was watching We Are Lady Parts. It's a musical comedy about a punk band in London that is [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=443.14s)]
*  made up of all Muslim women. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=448.14s)]
*  It's a musical comedy about a punk band in London that's made up of all Muslim women. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=451.14s)]
*  I mean, okay, I guess there's something wrong with that. But every story is a story about [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=458.14s)]
*  a musical comedy in London about a punk band of all Muslim women. I mean, really, the programming [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=464.14s)]
*  is like AI generated. That's all of NPR right now. Listen to the question this NPR personality [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=471.14s)]
*  asks about the new Matrix film. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=478.14s)]
*  Emily, have you seen the latest Matrix film? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=481.14s)]
*  I have indeed. It's wonderful. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=484.14s)]
*  Now, any additional trans allegories teased in the film or is this something that maybe [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=486.14s)]
*  is being left for the first three? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=493.14s)]
*  So if you're running a news organization, obviously one of the critical questions you're [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=497.14s)]
*  going to have to answer right up front is how many trans allegories are there in the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=500.14s)]
*  Matrix? NPR is doing that. And we could go on and on. In fact, we could play you NPR's [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=504.14s)]
*  coverage about decolonizing hair salons and a lot more, but we'll stop because it's tiresome [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=510.14s)]
*  and this isn't NPR. But it is still not enough for NPR's own hyper woke employees. National [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=514.14s)]
*  Public Radio has been so thoroughly radicalized, it's on the verge of destroying itself from [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=523.14s)]
*  within. Crystal Fleming, a sociologist, presumably studying marginalized communities, just released [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=528.14s)]
*  this assessment of NPR's toxic white supremacy. Quote, the problem at NPR is white supremacy [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=533.14s)]
*  that so few are saying this explicitly is telling indeed. By the way, notice the passive [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=540.14s)]
*  construction of the sentence and the word indeed. Signifiers of low IQ, just so you [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=547.14s)]
*  know. In any case, a former NPR co-host called Shrinil Mirajai agreed with this. Quote, one [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=552.14s)]
*  thing I want to point out is the small percentage of Latino, Latina, Latinx employees who work [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=560.14s)]
*  at NPR. What are we now? We? 18.5% of the U.S. population, but only 7% at NPR. Not a [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=566.14s)]
*  good look. How upset about this can you be? The revolution always eats itself. In an NPR's [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=573.14s)]
*  case, it's kind of hard to weep about that. But here's the deepest irony of all. This [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=582.14s)]
*  is what you will enjoy the very most. So NPR spends all of its time attacking privileged [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=586.14s)]
*  white people. Privileged white people, white supremacy. But privileged white people are [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=591.14s)]
*  NPR's core audience. In fact, they're the only people who listen. And we check the audience [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=595.14s)]
*  numbers. Here's what they are. NPR's audience is 84% white. Now, we have no problem with [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=600.14s)]
*  that. We don't hate white people. We're not racist, unlike NPR. But for comparison, that's [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=605.14s)]
*  higher than the numbers at Fox News. Now, NPR is always claiming that Fox News is some [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=612.14s)]
*  kind of white supremacist organization. By the way, Fox News has a significantly larger [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=617.14s)]
*  black and a much larger Hispanic audience than NPR has, both overall and as a percentage [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFPuPQUF80&t=622.14s)]
