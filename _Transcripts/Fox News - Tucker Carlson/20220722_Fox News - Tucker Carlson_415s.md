# Steve Bannon talks to Tucker Carlson on 'guilty' verdict
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [July 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw)
*  Steve Bannon is the former White House Chief Strategist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=0.0s)]
*  He's also the host of The War Room. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=3.58s)]
*  And as we just told you, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=4.94s)]
*  he's just been convicted of two crimes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=5.88s)]
*  Steve Bannon, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=7.94s)]
*  You can't kind of help but notice [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=10.02s)]
*  that you were convicted of a crime, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=12.86s)]
*  which is not actually a crime [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=14.76s)]
*  most of the time in Washington or ever. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=15.94s)]
*  Within the same 24 hour period [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=18.7s)]
*  is a guy who tried to murder a gubernatorial candidate [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=21.22s)]
*  in New York was released with no bail. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  What are we to make of these two events occurring [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=26.54s)]
*  the same day? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=29.48s)]
*  Well, as you can tell, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  the Democrats are completely lawless [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=33.32s)]
*  and look how they've run this committee. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=34.92s)]
*  There's no ranking member. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  There's no minority council. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=37.64s)]
*  It's not like the traditional hearings [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=38.72s)]
*  that have galvanized the nation in the past. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=41.0s)]
*  And Tucker, I think it's one of the reasons [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=42.56s)]
*  that it hasn't really had that big an impact. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=44.44s)]
*  You know, when they interviewed the people on the trial, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=46.74s)]
*  I think almost all the working class people [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=49.68s)]
*  didn't even know what was going on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=51.28s)]
*  Your show with people like Darren Beatty [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=53.32s)]
*  and Revolver and Rahim Ghani, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  you've done actually more original reporting [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=57.4s)]
*  on what we've got to get to the bottom. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=59.78s)]
*  Look, we need a commission or a committee on January 6th. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=61.14s)]
*  It's got to be with the new Congress, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  with Republicans in charge. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=67.3s)]
*  And we've got to get to the bottom [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=68.86s)]
*  of the intelligence failures, FBI involvement, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  DHS involvement, the intelligence services, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=72.38s)]
*  what happened to the Pentagon and the National Guard, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=74.7s)]
*  all of this, Ashley Babbitt, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=77.34s)]
*  all of this, we have to get to the bottom of it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=79.5s)]
*  And people are going to get to the bottom of it, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=82.06s)]
*  even to the fact of some of the testimony [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  that was given by staffers in mild trial. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=85.64s)]
*  You know, we wanted decision makers to come over [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=88.54s)]
*  and actually go on record under oath [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=91.3s)]
*  and say exactly what happened here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=94.34s)]
*  And they wouldn't, they hid behind a privilege [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=95.74s)]
*  of which they wouldn't allow me to judge [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=97.9s)]
*  the time NARA cast us on the executive privilege issue. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=101.64s)]
*  I spent my whole life in Washington. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=104.7s)]
*  I've seen a lot of acrimonious debates, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=106.9s)]
*  but the idea you would send someone to prison [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=108.78s)]
*  because you don't like his political views, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=111.86s)]
*  there's no allegation that you organized January 6th [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  that were there storming the cabinet, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=116.27999999999999s)]
*  this is fully insane. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  They don't like your politics, they hate your attitude [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=118.96s)]
*  and they're trying to send you to jail. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=122.28s)]
*  Did you think this, I didn't think this could happen, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  we'll start there, did you think this could happen? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  100% I think it happened. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=129.12s)]
*  Remember, these guys all thought they were going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=130.88s)]
*  to change China and the Chinese Communist Party, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=132.92s)]
*  they're taking on the aspects of the authoritarian state [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=135.12s)]
*  and state capitalism combined. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=137.68s)]
*  This is the elites that run this country, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=139.64s)]
*  this is exactly how they want to run it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=141.86s)]
*  Remember, Tucker, I'm not new to this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  I've spent more than any Trump official in intense, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=145.54s)]
*  being a witness in the Mueller Commission [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  for I think 30 hours, in the House Intelligence Committee, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=153.26s)]
*  the Senate Intelligence Committee, I had Bill Burke, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=157.1s)]
*  I had Alex Spyro, here I had David Schoen, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=159.08s)]
*  I had top lawyers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=161.72s)]
*  They wouldn't even let it be that I could rely [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=163.02s)]
*  on the opinion of my lawyer. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=165.66s)]
*  Here they took away every possible defense, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=167.74s)]
*  somebody can have a defense of law. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=170.72s)]
*  That's why we didn't even put on the defense, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  we just had a closing argument, a closing argument. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=174.48s)]
*  Tucker, this is where they're going. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  You document it better than anybody, but no. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=178.76s)]
*  People have to understand, this is just one fight [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  in an entire process and that's why it's absolutely incumbent [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  that Liz Cheney's defeated in a couple of weeks in Wyoming [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=187.04s)]
*  by the Republican Party and by conservatives and by MAGA [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=190.64s)]
*  and then later, we've already got Kinzinger out, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=194.04s)]
*  we got another member of the committee [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  I think has already retired, we got to defeat Luria, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=197.44s)]
*  but we must have a sweeping victory in the House [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=199.5s)]
*  and then Republicans have to have the stones [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  to put on a real hearing and by the way, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=205.38s)]
*  let the Democrats have a ranking member, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=207.38s)]
*  let them have a council and just get to it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  If you look at what Darren Beatty's done on your show alone, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  it's outrageous what the public doesn't know about this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  For the good of the system, this has to happen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=217.54s)]
*  But in the meantime, you've just been convicted. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=221.2s)]
*  How do you feel about going to jail? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=226.5s)]
*  Are you confident you would be safe there, for example? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=228.4s)]
*  First off, if I go to jail, I go to jail. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=232.56s)]
*  I will never back off a second, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=234.72s)]
*  look, I spent eight years as a naval officer, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=236.96s)]
*  I've committed my life to this program to get this done. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  I will never back off. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  I support Trump in the Constitution [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=243.46s)]
*  and I'm not backing off one inch. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=245.4s)]
*  If I go to jail, so be it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=247.06s)]
*  But look, we've got a long appeals process. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=248.64s)]
*  Andy McCarthy did a great hit on Fox earlier today. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=250.56s)]
*  We got a long appeals process. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=253.64s)]
*  I think the law's with us on a number of situations. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  I think some of this is really gonna be adjudicated, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=258.66s)]
*  maybe even higher than the appellate courts. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=260.82s)]
*  I'm very confident that we're 100% right on the law, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=262.98s)]
*  but I'm gonna fight this all the way. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=266.18s)]
*  And this is not the only battle we're fighting. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  They're coming at us on every aspect. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=269.02s)]
*  Look, they're trying to shut you down, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=270.98s)]
*  they're trying to throw off Fox anchors, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=272.58s)]
*  they're coming for everybody. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=274.82s)]
*  And people have to understand, right now, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=275.88s)]
*  this is an ideological war and we cannot lose. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=278.02s)]
*  The fate of the country is over the next couple of years. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  And if people just wanna go on vacation and say, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  hey, I'll just let it get sorted out, that's fine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  But there are just thousands and thousands [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=288.2s)]
*  and thousands of fighters out there to say, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEw1cg1D3Jw&t=290.71999999999997s)]
