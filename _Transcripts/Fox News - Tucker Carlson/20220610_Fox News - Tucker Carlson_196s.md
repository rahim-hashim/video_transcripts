# Michio Kaku: The entire universe will be aware of this one explosion
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [June 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY)
*  So we don't care what anybody says. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=0.0s)]
*  We don't care how many people dismiss that if you're crazy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=11.84s)]
*  We think the fact that there are objects floating around in our atmosphere and apparently outside [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=15.22s)]
*  it that are not of human origin, but are that it clearly intelligently controlled is a huge [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=20.66s)]
*  story. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=26.32s)]
*  In fact, it's hard to think of a bigger story. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=27.32s)]
*  And I know it's not about January 6th, but it's important and it has extraordinary implications [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=28.44s)]
*  for all of us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=34.12s)]
*  Scientists have now detected mysterious radio signals coming from space. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=35.12s)]
*  What does that mean exactly? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=38.16s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=39.72s)]
*  Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist and one of the people who's been paying closest [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=40.72s)]
*  attention, and one of the most knowledgeable on this, he joins us to explain. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  So what do you think this is or what could it be? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=51.24s)]
*  Well, these are called FRBs, fast radio bursts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=56.48s)]
*  They are among the biggest explosions of radio energy in the entire universe. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=60.08s)]
*  They generate more energy than a billion suns. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=66.08s)]
*  The energy in radio frequencies is so great that eventually the entire universe will be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  aware of this one explosion. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=75.38s)]
*  And then the question is, what drives these things? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=78.34s)]
*  Colliding black holes, neutron stars being gobbled up? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=81.12s)]
*  Well, your guess is as good as mine, but some people believe in renegade theories that perhaps [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=85.0s)]
*  there's a design to some of these things. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  Do they seem to be behaving in a way that suggests a design, an intelligent design? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, we've detected 500 of these bursts of radio radiation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Most of them are irregular. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=108.72s)]
*  They burst once in a millisecond and then they're gone forever. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=109.72s)]
*  But recently in the Chinese radio telescope, they were able to show that their bursts are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=113.56s)]
*  periodic and some people are saying maybe, just maybe there's a reason for that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=121.56s)]
*  You see, if you were an alien civilization and you want to have a coming out party, so [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  to speak, wouldn't you want to advertise to the entire universe that you have come of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  age? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=136.72s)]
*  And that's what these bursts of radiation can do. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=137.72s)]
*  They will eventually permeate the entire universe. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=140.28s)]
*  Now, if that sounds crazy to you, just realize that even on the Earth, astronomers about [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=143.56s)]
*  two years from now will celebrate the fact that 50 years ago we sent a message saying [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=148.64s)]
*  that we have come of age. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Carl Sagan was the one who famously got this information together about who we are and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=156.44s)]
*  they broadcasted it to the heavens so that some alien civilization will pick it up and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=161.76s)]
*  perhaps encounter us and say, hi, we picked up your invitation for your going coming out [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=167.56s)]
*  party. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=173.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=174.0s)]
*  Well, they haven't shown any malicious intent so far, whatever this is. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=175.0s)]
*  Professor Koppio, I appreciate you coming on tonight. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=180.4s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=182.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=183.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pchMFN14dY&t=184.4s)]
