# Doctor warns Tucker of the dangers of race-based hiring
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A)
*  So the thing you want to watch is not the periphery but the core. That is the critical industries [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=0.0s)]
*  aviation transportation more broadly energy and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=6.76s)]
*  medicine and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=10.8s)]
*  there's a problem in the medical profession for some reason medical schools and hospitals have become convinced that the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=12.08s)]
*  appearance of your doctor is [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=19.64s)]
*  The most important thing you can judge a book by its cover and CNN of course is pushing hard watch [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=21.92s)]
*  Right now fewer than six percent of doctors in the u.s. Identifies black or african-american [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=28.840000000000003s)]
*  That's despite the fact that the community makes up 12 percent of the country's total population [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=35.0s)]
*  And that's raising concerns about the impact on public health research shows that when we have a more diverse physician workforce. There's more [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=39.88s)]
*  Understanding and more trust between the patient and the doctor the doctor has an understanding of the patient's cultural [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  experiences cultural background lived experiences [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=54.96s)]
*  Especially when it comes to racism or discrimination or other aspects of their life that can help with that physician patient a relationship [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=57.6s)]
*  It's super simple if there was ever a place where we need a pure meritocracy the most qualified people get the jobs [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=67.36s)]
*  It's in medicine most doctors believe that very few are willing to say it. Dr. Marilyn Singleton is one of them [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=73.68s)]
*  She's got a piece in the Washington Post called [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=79.84s)]
*  I'm a black physician and I'm appalled by mandated implicit bias training and we are happy to have her join us today [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=82.2s)]
*  Dr. Marilyn Singleton doctor. Thank you so much for coming on why you've practiced medicine for a long time. Thank you for inviting me [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Oh, well, we're delighted to have you. What have you noticed that has changed in your profession in medicine recently? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  And why are you concerned about it? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=102.28s)]
*  Well, I'm concerned one I grew up in a time when there was [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  Segregation and we moved from black people having to go to black universities [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=111.02000000000001s)]
*  To where it was completely open and I was able to go to top-tier universities where my parents didn't necessarily do that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=115.78s)]
*  And then when I went to medical school [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=122.78s)]
*  Diversity meant groups of different people all over the country different [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  Backgrounds and whatnot all we wanted to do was get good grades and be the best doctor that we possibly could and take the best [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=131.26s)]
*  care of patients [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=138.9s)]
*  suddenly we fast forward now and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=140.74s)]
*  We don't even hear about getting good grades. All we hear about is oh a black patient should have a black doctor [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=143.82s)]
*  well, that is so wrong a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=150.34s)]
*  Black patient should have a good doctor and that's what all patients want and certainly black patients [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=153.38s)]
*  Don't want that and you believe me if you get rolled into an emergency room [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=160.26s)]
*  You don't want a patient having to look up at that doctor sideways something [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=165.9s)]
*  Hmm, is this one of those evil white devils or is this a good doctor? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=170.42s)]
*  who's going to take care of my stab wound to the abdomen and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=175.38s)]
*  This is so wrong and it's being [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=180.02s)]
*  Pushed on people and I don't like the demonization of my colleagues that I've worked with for years [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=184.94s)]
*  For years [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=191.5s)]
*  Save patients lives with have them come to me for advice on how to do something and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=192.66s)]
*  Suddenly, I'm not supposed to trust them. They're not supposed to trust me [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=199.26s)]
*  Am I suddenly a stupid black person? It's it's completely flipped on its head [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=203.82s)]
*  There was a time when black people were considered not up to the to the task to the job and couldn't be [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=209.66s)]
*  professionals couldn't be doctors and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=217.06s)]
*  We are we're smart. We're just like anybody else and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=219.26s)]
*  Suddenly white doctors are the ones that have the evil aura around them and we expect [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=223.3s)]
*  Black patients to then want to trust that doctor and it's hokum that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=230.86s)]
*  Black patient needs a black doctor number one. It could never happen. There aren't enough doctors [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=236.66s)]
*  How could you match these people up? What happens when you go into an emergency and I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=241.86s)]
*  Honestly as an anesthesiologist, I've done plenty of emergencies. I've been a doctor for hate to say 50 years now and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=247.9s)]
*  patients look at you and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=257.14s)]
*  Years ago all they wondered are you old enough to know how to do this and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=260.94s)]
*  they wondered about your competence and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=266.62s)]
*  this is wrong having so much focus on race and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=270.14s)]
*  Bringing back the kind of focus that we fought for so many years to be gone to look at people as [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=275.18s)]
*  individuals and their talents their personality their compassion and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=283.06s)]
*  They're wiping it away and it's just wrong. It's criminal [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=290.06s)]
*  Why are you one of such a tiny minority of practicing physicians willing to say that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it's like so many times and I'm sure you've been in these meetings where everybody's thinking the same thing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  but nobody wants to say it out loud and with and part of it is what's happening in medicine all over that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=307.4s)]
*  We now have private practice only 47% of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=314.8s)]
*  Physicians and so you're looking at 53% of physicians are employed or they work for one of these big health systems [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=318.68s)]
*  They're afraid [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=326.52s)]
*  They're afraid how they're afraid to lose their jobs and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=328.32s)]
*  It's kind of hard to blame them when you're in private practice and you're taking care of your own patients for your own self [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=333.2s)]
*  You know you can say what you want and your patients when they love you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=340.56s)]
*  They love you and they don't care what color you are. They're just glad that you give them good treatment [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=344.88s)]
*  Bless you for saying that I mean it sounds obvious [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=351.68s)]
*  But when you're one of the only people willing to say it we're really grateful for your willingness to do that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=354.32s)]
*  Dr. Marilyn Singleton appreciate it [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhseL3fgD4A&t=358.92s)]
