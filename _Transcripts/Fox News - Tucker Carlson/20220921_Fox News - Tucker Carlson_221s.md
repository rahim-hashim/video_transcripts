# Will other countries follow El Salvador's lead on tackling crime?
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s)
*  We are honored to be joined right now by the president of El Salvador, President Buckele. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. President, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=5.36s)]
*  So it sounds to me like you reduced the murder rate in El Salvador in a pretty straightforward [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=7.92s)]
*  way. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=13.44s)]
*  I wonder why other heads of state aren't calling you for advice on how to do it in their countries. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=14.44s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker, for having me. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=20.56s)]
*  And I'm glad to be here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=21.56s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=23.56s)]
*  Every country, I think, has their own problems. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=25.32s)]
*  I would guess that probably our approach, that is very, very popular with the people, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=28.259999999999998s)]
*  has a problem. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  And the problem is that it has common sense. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=35.78s)]
*  And I say it's a problem because usually the new wave of governance is taking away common [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=38.7s)]
*  sense and it started doing things the other way around, the way that, of course, you shouldn't [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  do them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  So when you, it seems like when you became president in 2019, you focused very specifically [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=51.339999999999996s)]
*  on crime, gangs, murder. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=58.12s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  And why did you do that? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  Why that issue? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=63.22s)]
*  Well, not only on crime, of course, we focus on other issues, education, health, public [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=64.22s)]
*  works, investment, tourism, infrastructure, et cetera. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=69.17999999999999s)]
*  But of course, crime is the most important thing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=72.62s)]
*  I mean, you might enjoy a road or a beach, but that's if you're alive. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=75.7s)]
*  So of course, the lives of the people are the most important thing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=80.82s)]
*  So that's why we focus on crime more. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=83.41999999999999s)]
*  But of course, we did focus on all the other issues as well. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=86.41999999999999s)]
*  So you've threatened to cut off food to gang members in prison if they don't stop the killings [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=91.05999999999999s)]
*  on the outside. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that they are directing those killings? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  They're responsible for them? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=101.74s)]
*  And do you think this will work? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=102.74s)]
*  Well, at the beginning they were. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=103.74s)]
*  They were ordering the killings from the prisons. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=105.22s)]
*  In the prisons they had, if you see most of the prisons in Latin America, they're like [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  headquarters for crime. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  They'll be there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=115.58s)]
*  They have phones, internet access, computers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=116.58s)]
*  They will give orders from the inside to the outside. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=118.66s)]
*  You can find everywhere in Central and Latin America, you can find all of those examples. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  Now in El Salvador, communicating to the outside, it's impossible. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=131.22s)]
*  You can't communicate from a prison to the outside. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=134.98s)]
*  The internet access is blocked. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=138.42s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=140.7s)]
*  So, but still, all these gang members are the bosses of the other gang members outside. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=141.7s)]
*  So of course, gang members outside resent if you, and what would it be like if you do [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=148.48s)]
*  something to their bosses inside the prisons? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=155.42s)]
*  So one of the things we did was we threatened gang members outside that we will take retaliation [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=158.56s)]
*  with their people inside if they continue the killings of innocent people in El Salvador. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=164.5s)]
*  That actually, if some people don't know this, but El Salvador was actually the murder capital [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=170.94s)]
*  of the world. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=175.66s)]
*  I mean, we were a lot more dangerous than Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, you name it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=176.66s)]
*  El Salvador was the worst and the most dangerous place to live. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=182.18s)]
*  It was the murder capital of the world. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=187.3s)]
*  And now we're on our way to be the safest country in the whole American continent. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=189.98s)]
*  It's an amazing story. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=196.06s)]
*  And I hope mayors of our cities, Baltimore, Gary, Indiana, New York City will call you [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=197.98s)]
*  for advice on how to replicate your successes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=204.82s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=206.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=207.7s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=208.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dST-SqoKk0s&t=219.98s)]
