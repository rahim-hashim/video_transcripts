# Tucker: Biden can't regulate his emotions
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, Joe Biden announced he was running for president again in April of 2019. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=3.56s)]
*  It was Biden's third or fourth attempt at the office, depending how you count. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=8.84s)]
*  So at that moment, most Americans thought they knew who Joe Biden was. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=13.16s)]
*  After 50 years in office, they were familiar with his face, but it turns out they weren't [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=16.88s)]
*  familiar with his new face. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=20.46s)]
*  Two months later, Biden appeared on stage in Miami for the first Democratic primary [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=22.2s)]
*  debate, and he was hard to recognize, even for people who had known him. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=26.32s)]
*  Extensive plastic surgery made him look like a different person, but most jarring was the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=29.8s)]
*  fact that he did not sound like the old Joe Biden. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  You probably remembered Biden as blustery and jovial, Irish charm by the bucket load. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=37.04s)]
*  He was famous for that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=42.68s)]
*  And yet on stage, Biden came off as remote and muted. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=44.28s)]
*  He seemed to be at times afraid to speak for fear of tripping over words or forgetting them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Several times, the camera caught him just staring out into the middle's distance. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  He was apparently absorbed in memory. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=55.96s)]
*  When Biden did manage to focus his attention, he seemed highly annoyed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=58.96s)]
*  Whatever the cause, Democratic primary voters were not impressed by his performance. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=64.4s)]
*  Joe Biden's numbers dropped 10 points overnight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=67.72s)]
*  The Biden campaign has never explained what exactly happened to Joe Biden that night in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=70.72s)]
*  Miami, but whatever it was, it never got fixed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  It continues. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=77.2s)]
*  From that day until now, probably the most authentic feature of Joe Biden's public performances [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=78.28s)]
*  has been his anger that seems to come over him in waves. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=83.8s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=87.36s)]
*  What's on this man? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=88.36s)]
*  What he's doing that no president has ever done? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=89.96s)]
*  No president. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=93.48s)]
*  No, I haven't taken a test. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=94.48s)]
*  Why the hell would I take a test? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=96.12s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=99.12s)]
*  That's like saying you, before you got in this program, you take a test where you're [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=100.56s)]
*  taking cocaine or not. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=103.8s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=104.8s)]
*  Huh? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=105.8s)]
*  Are you a junkie? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=106.8s)]
*  I'm not out of time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=107.8s)]
*  You spoke over time and I'm going to talk. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=108.8s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=110.8s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=111.8s)]
*  The fact of the matter is, look at what's happening here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=112.8s)]
*  Well, that's not true. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=117.72s)]
*  You're saying things you do not know what you're talking about. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=118.72s)]
*  No one said that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=121.4s)]
*  Who said that? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=122.4s)]
*  Who said that? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=123.4s)]
*  You said I set up my son to work in an oil company. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=124.4s)]
*  Do you know what you said? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=127.4s)]
*  Get your words straight, Jack. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=128.4s)]
*  That's a great asset. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=129.4s)]
*  More inflation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=130.4s)]
*  What a stupid son of a bitch. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=131.4s)]
*  So you know exactly what that is. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=132.4s)]
*  You've seen it in people around you, people you love. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=133.88s)]
*  You've seen it in people around you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=136.88s)]
*  You've seen it in people around you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=139.88s)]
*  You've seen it in people around you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=142.88s)]
*  People you love. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=146.04s)]
*  It has nothing to do with politics. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=147.04s)]
*  What you just saw is a man who is losing the ability to regulate his emotions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=149.12s)]
*  Uncontrollable flashes of anger are common among people who are aging, particularly among [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=154.24s)]
*  men and they often accompany senility. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=158.44s)]
*  Losing it is a very frustrating experience and your heart goes out to anyone who is. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=161.44s)]
*  We have deep sympathy for anyone in that position, including Joe Biden. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=165.88s)]
*  But Biden is the president of the United States and this is the single most volatile moment [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=170.56s)]
*  in the recent history of our country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=175.48s)]
*  Biden is leading the U.S. toward war. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  And so it's fair to assess the effect on the rest of us of his mental and emotional [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  conditions. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  Not simply about age. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  Biden is 79. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  Biden is clearly unable to speak with precision. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=190.04s)]
*  And when you're president of the United States and the world hangs on your every word, when [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  your words constitute American policy, when you can change American policy, particularly [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  simply by saying so, it is essential that you speak the words you intend to speak, that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=204.08s)]
*  you not get carried away because you're mad and say something you don't mean that might [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=211.24s)]
*  threaten the long term interests of this country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=216.12s)]
*  Threaten the families and the children of the rest of us and our future. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=219.52s)]
*  But he is. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  That's exactly what he's doing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  That's not a partisan attack. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  It's true. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=227.52s)]
*  If you doubt that it's true, watch his performance just over the past week. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=228.82s)]
*  On Thursday, for example, Joe Biden was asked how the United States would respond if the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  Russian government used chemical weapons in Ukraine. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=237.14s)]
*  Now that's a hypothetical question. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=240.18s)]
*  Presidents at the podium often get those. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=241.84s)]
*  Presidents rarely respond to hypothetical questions for a very simple reason. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=244.34s)]
*  They don't know the circumstances ahead of time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=248.18s)]
*  So there's no reason to risk American prestige or to terrify the rest of the world by saying [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=251.54s)]
*  the wrong thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=256.92s)]
*  They don't. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=257.92s)]
*  Biden had no obligation to answer that question. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=258.92s)]
*  Very few presidents would have answered it, but Biden did answer it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=262.24s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=265.32s)]
*  And to clarify on chemical weapons, could, if chemical weapons were used in Ukraine, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  would that trigger a military response from NATO? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  It would trigger a response in kind, whether or not you're asking whether NATO would cross, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=275.48s)]
*  we'd make that decision at the time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=282.04s)]
*  So he's closing his eyes trying to remember what the cue card says. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=284.86s)]
*  What's our policy? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=288.76s)]
*  And what he comes out with is if Russia uses chemical weapons, the U.S. will respond in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=289.76s)]
*  kind. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=296.2s)]
*  If Russia uses new chemical weapons, the United States will use chemical weapons. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=297.42s)]
*  So no American president has said anything like that in your lifetime. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=303.82s)]
*  You grew up assuming the United States would never use chemical weapons because the United [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  States is not a rogue state. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=311.76s)]
*  In fact, our role globally is to suppress rogue states. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=313.46s)]
*  They tell us that's what we're doing right now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=316.36s)]
*  And yet in a flash of peek, because he couldn't remember the correct words, Joe Biden, the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=319.12s)]
*  president of the United States, reversed 100 years of American security policy in the middle [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  of a war. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=330.04s)]
*  This did not escape the attention of his own national security adviser, who instantly responded [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  by restoring the status quo or attempting to. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=337.32s)]
*  The United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period, under any circumstances, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=340.28s)]
*  said Jake Sullivan, flatly contradicting his boss. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  No one who works for the president wants to do that, but Jake Sullivan had no choice. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=350.0s)]
*  He works for a man who cannot even pronounce his own vice president's name consistently [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=355.79999999999995s)]
*  and yet is in charge of the United States at the most delicate moment in our lifetimes. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=361.12s)]
*  But Biden didn't slow down. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=368.96s)]
*  He kept going. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=370.38s)]
*  The next day, his advisers allowed him to fly to Poland to, quote, rally the international [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=371.62s)]
*  community in support of Ukraine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  And while in Poland, Biden met with soldiers from the 82nd Airborne. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  They're currently stationed there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=381.88s)]
*  As cameras roll, Joe Biden informed these soldiers that they would soon be sent to Ukraine. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=383.76s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=388.88s)]
*  The average citizen, look at how they're stepping up. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=389.88s)]
*  Look at how they're stepping up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=393.56s)]
*  And you're going to see when you're there, some time you've been there, you're going [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=396.08s)]
*  to see, you're going to see women, young people standing in the middle of a damn tank just [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  saying, I'm not leaving. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=406.68s)]
*  I'm holding my ground. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  So the previous president was often criticized, sometime with justification, for not using [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=412.12s)]
*  words precisely. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=417.38s)]
*  You're the president. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=418.38s)]
*  You can't just tweet out anything. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=419.38s)]
*  That's the case you heard for four years. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=421.52s)]
*  And again, it was often rooted in truth. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=423.2s)]
*  But the last president never said anything that even approaches the crazed recklessness [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=425.92s)]
*  of what you just heard. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=430.62s)]
*  You're going to see when you're there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  Where? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=433.24s)]
*  In Ukraine. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=434.24s)]
*  So the 82nd Airborne apparently is going to Ukraine. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=435.38s)]
*  Their commander in chief just told them that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=438.12s)]
*  Of course, they had no idea. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=440.12s)]
*  Neither did their families. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=441.64000000000004s)]
*  Neither did anyone in the United States until Joe Biden said it live on Friday. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=442.76s)]
*  The White House didn't even know. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  Fox News reached out to Biden's spokesman after those remarks, and no one there. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=449.56s)]
*  No one in the White House seemed to wear that those remarks had been caught on tape. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=454.24s)]
*  So how to explain this abrupt change in American foreign policy? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  Quote, the president has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=463.32s)]
*  is no change in that position. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  End quote. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=470.64s)]
*  So for the second time in three days, the administration has to flatly contradict the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  commander in chief. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=478.08s)]
*  And not on a minor question. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  These are often written off as a gaffe. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=481.68s)]
*  No, a gaffe is when you mispronounce somebody's name. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  Telling troops they're going to be sent to Ukraine, pledging the United States is going [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  to use chemical weapons? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=492.8s)]
*  These are not gaffes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=494.68s)]
*  These are something else. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=496.6s)]
*  They're dangerous, that's for sure. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=497.76s)]
*  So the best the White House can do is telling us, well, the president, by saying he's sending [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=499.92s)]
*  American troops to Ukraine, is reaffirming our policy of not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for the clarification. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=508.76s)]
*  What else could they say? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=509.92s)]
*  And it got even weirder from there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=511.36s)]
*  On Saturday, once again, completely out of nowhere, with no warning whatsoever and apparently [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  no forethought, Joe Biden called for regime change in Russia. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=522.52s)]
*  A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people's love for liberty. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=523.52s)]
*  Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=532.2s)]
*  For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=536.72s)]
*  Doing his Churchill routine fine. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=544.32s)]
*  When things aren't going well at home, all presidents seek solace abroad, where they're [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=546.52s)]
*  taken much more seriously than they are by their own voters. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  But he couldn't stop himself. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=555.4s)]
*  Joe Biden said of Vladimir Putin, now set aside how you feel about Putin, you probably [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=559.12s)]
*  don't like him. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=563.52s)]
*  For good reason, our policy, according to the President of the United States, is to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=565.52s)]
*  take Putin out, to remove him as head of state. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=567.92s)]
*  To be clear, regime change in Russia has never been American policy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=572.4s)]
*  And this is hardly the first time we have tangled with Russia. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=577.26s)]
*  We've had far more threatening circumstances than this one. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=580.28s)]
*  The United States, you'll recall, waged a proxy war against the Russian government for [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=583.04s)]
*  11 years in Vietnam. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=586.68s)]
*  Nearly 60,000 Americans died in that war. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=589.0s)]
*  And yet, no American president mentioned regime change at the Kremlin. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=592.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=597.44s)]
*  Because they were soft on the Russians? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=598.44s)]
*  No. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=599.64s)]
*  Because Russia has about 6,000 nuclear weapons. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=600.64s)]
*  So let's say we eliminated the Russian head of state and, of course, that country's central [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=604.08s)]
*  government. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=608.08s)]
*  What would happen to those weapons? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=609.08s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  In Iraq, Saddam's weapons stockpiles, all conventional, wound up in the hands of militia that used [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=612.0400000000001s)]
*  them to kill Americans. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=617.84s)]
*  So Russia has a large and restive population of Islamic extremists. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=619.84s)]
*  Do we think it's possible that with no one running the country, because of course we [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=624.96s)]
*  have no chosen successor to Putin, is it possible, if we did that, that one of those 6,000 nuclear [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=627.96s)]
*  weapons might wind up in the hands of some anti-American terror group and be used against [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=633.4s)]
*  our civilian population here? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  A nuclear weapon? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=639.96s)]
*  Well, that's not just possible. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=640.96s)]
*  It's likely. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=643.76s)]
*  And that's if we were to succeed in killing Putin. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=645.12s)]
*  What if we don't kill Putin? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=647.72s)]
*  This apparently is now our policy. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=649.9000000000001s)]
*  The President of the United States just informed the Russian government that he seeks its overthrow. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=652.1s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself, does hearing that make Vladimir Putin more or less likely [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=656.5s)]
*  to use a nuclear weapon against the United States and Western Europe? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=664.5400000000001s)]
*  How do trapped animals behave? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=665.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, they lash out with fangs and claws. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=666.5400000000001s)]
*  Desperate people are dangerous people, of course. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=669.7800000000001s)]
*  So it would be in the interest of the United States, and that's the only interest that [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=674.62s)]
*  matters from our perspective, to cool the rhetoric a little bit. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=678.1s)]
*  Or when you employ overheated rhetoric to do it for a reason, in the service of a clearly [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=681.78s)]
*  articulated goal that helps the United States and not just because you're old and pissed, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=686.62s)]
*  which is exactly what you just saw. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=690.78s)]
*  A guy who just lost control of what he was saying because he was too mad. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=692.3000000000001s)]
*  It's all pretty obvious. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=697.1800000000001s)]
*  No one in Washington has spent 30 seconds thinking about what would happen if we knocked [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=698.1800000000001s)]
*  off Putin or if we talk about knocking off Putin. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=702.0s)]
*  In fact, our foreign policy establishment spent the weekend congratulating Joe Biden [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=705.06s)]
*  on saying the wrong thing. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=709.18s)]
*  They compared him to Ronald Reagan. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=710.68s)]
*  Washington loves regime change. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=713.2199999999999s)]
*  It's what comes after regime change they'd rather not consider and have no track record [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=715.02s)]
*  of pulling off. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=719.7199999999999s)]
*  But for now, they were thrilled. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=721.4599999999999s)]
*  Bill Kristol compared Biden's threat to Reagan, telling Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down this [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=722.4599999999999s)]
*  wall because everything in D.C. is cliche based. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=727.3s)]
*  Rick Wilson agreed, quote, Biden did tear down this wall for our era. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=730.1s)]
*  Again, the cliches. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=734.66s)]
*  Dumb people speak and think in cliches because they have no other terms at hand. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=736.14s)]
*  Former White House correspondent at CBS News, Mark Knoller, said Biden was even better than [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=741.22s)]
*  Ronald Reagan. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=744.48s)]
*  Quote, tops Reagan's 1987 tear down this wall speech. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=745.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=748.74s)]
*  To its credit, for once, the White House did not run toward the applause. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=750.22s)]
*  They're apparently still an adult or two working there. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=753.82s)]
*  And they immediately tried to tell us that Biden hadn't actually meant what he told us [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=756.86s)]
*  on camera. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=760.76s)]
*  He didn't really mean it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=761.76s)]
*  Any statement that begins this way is a lie. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=762.76s)]
*  The president's point, okay, we can discern his point, he said it, but the president's [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=765.0s)]
*  point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=769.0s)]
*  He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia or regime change. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=773.8000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=777.74s)]
*  Well, that's of course not true, but at least it's reassuring to know our policy remains [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=778.74s)]
*  the same. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=783.26s)]
*  The Republicans in DC, of course, were highly distressed. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=784.26s)]
*  CIA operative Rodney Farron, for example, wrote this, quote, this would have been Biden's [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=787.58s)]
*  tear down this wall moment, but for White House staffers watering down his meaning afterward. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=792.14s)]
*  A few hours ago, Biden once again stepped in front of the microphone and reaffirmed [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=797.78s)]
*  that the words that had accidentally slipped out of his mouth over the weekend because [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=803.5s)]
*  he was mad and he has no self-control are actually, officially, U.S. policy. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=812.3s)]
*  Do you believe what you said, that Putin can't remain in power? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=813.8599999999999s)]
*  Or do you now regret saying that because your government has been trying to walk that back? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=817.8599999999999s)]
*  Did your words complicate matters? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=822.54s)]
*  Well, yes, three different questions. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=824.3s)]
*  I'll answer them all. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=826.6999999999999s)]
*  Number one, I'm not walking anything back. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=827.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm not walking anything back. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=831.42s)]
*  So regime change in Russia is now our policy. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=833.52s)]
*  That's what the president of the United States just told us. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=838.5799999999999s)]
*  And as he did, he rebuked the people who worked for him, which is fine with us. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=841.44s)]
*  They spent all week correcting statements that he makes up on the fly and hasn't thought [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=845.2800000000001s)]
*  through in any way. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=849.48s)]
*  Purely reactive. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=851.48s)]
*  Hey, Joe Biden, what would be the long-term effect of the United States of what you're doing? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=852.48s)]
*  No idea. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=856.8800000000001s)]
*  Don't have to think about the future now. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=857.8800000000001s)]
*  When everything is suddenly at stake, there has never been recklessness at this level [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=860.48s)]
*  in the White House. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=864.44s)]
*  And yes, that includes the last president, who was often attacked for being reckless. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=865.44s)]
*  Nothing he said compares to this. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=869.32s)]
*  Fox's Peter Ducey asked for clarification. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=871.4000000000001s)]
*  In response, Joe Biden revealed that he is completely unaware that his staff has been [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=873.24s)]
*  continuously updating American policy all week as he changes it on the fly. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=877.84s)]
*  Watch Joe Biden. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=882.48s)]
*  Are you worried that other leaders in the world are going to start to doubt that America [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=883.9200000000001s)]
*  is back if some of these big things that you say on the world stage keep getting walked [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=889.32s)]
*  back? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=895.48s)]
*  What's getting walked back? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=896.48s)]
*  It made it sound like just in the last couple days, it sounded like you told U.S. troops [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=897.48s)]
*  they were going to Ukraine. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=902.6800000000001s)]
*  It sounded like you said it was possible the U.S. would use a chemical weapon. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=904.6s)]
*  And it sounded like you were calling for regime change in Russia. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=908.28s)]
*  And we know... [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=913.0s)]
*  None of the three occurred. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=914.0s)]
*  None of the three occurred? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=916.0s)]
*  None of the three. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=917.0s)]
*  Mr. President? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=918.0s)]
*  You interpret the language that way. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=919.0s)]
*  What's getting walked back? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=922.28s)]
*  To be clear, he's not fit to lead, particularly right now. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=923.92s)]
*  Bernie Sanders scared the hell out of the banks. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=928.68s)]
*  Democratic Party short-circuited his campaign and installed Joe Biden. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=931.24s)]
*  Biden seemed kind of passive for a lot of voters. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=935.24s)]
*  That was a welcome respite from the last president who seemed kind of loud. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=938.12s)]
*  That's what actually happened. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=941.56s)]
*  No one anticipated at that moment that we would be on the cusp of a war with the nuclear [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=943.56s)]
*  on power in less than two years. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=947.84s)]
*  But that's exactly where we are now. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=949.84s)]
*  And under those circumstances, to have someone who has literally no idea what's going on, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=951.48s)]
*  doesn't even know that he's changing long-standing policies that adults have thought through, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=954.72s)]
*  when he does it, does scary describe that? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=958.48s)]
*  No, it's worse. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=961.8000000000001s)]
*  So Biden just said everything that he has said for the last week is true and none of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=963.12s)]
*  it has been corrected by people who work for him. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  The truth is Joe Biden has no idea. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=974.48s)]
*  Joe Biden has no idea what his publicists say when he goes to sleep. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=978.24s)]
*  Then midway through his answer, Biden starts walking back his own comments. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=982.36s)]
*  He does that just minutes after saying he would never walk back his own comments. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=985.16s)]
*  None of that occurred, Biden said. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=988.04s)]
*  Look, it feels almost like we're being mean to the guy by quoting him. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=990.32s)]
*  And no one wants that. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=993.76s)]
*  No one is making fun of his age or his diminished condition, only trying to defend the country. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=994.76s)]
*  Then moments later, Biden declared that no reasonable person would think he wants regime [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=999.12s)]
*  change in Russia. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=1002.52s)]
*  Watch this if you can stand it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=1003.52s)]
*  I was talking about taking down Putin. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=1008.24s)]
*  Nobody would believe that. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=1012.6800000000001s)]
*  All right, joke's over. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=1013.6800000000001s)]
*  Too much is at stake. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=1016.48s)]
*  If there was ever a time, if there was in U.S. history, ever a time to invoke the 25th [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=1017.48s)]
*  Amendment, it is now. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=1021.92s)]
*  As Joe Biden himself put it, for God's sakes, this man cannot remain in power. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsOnnLts-4U&t=1023.12s)]
