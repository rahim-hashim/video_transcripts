# Portnoy on Musk: Twitter needs to be 'even playing field', end censorship
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [April 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew)
*  So Elon Musk has bitten off a lot here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=0.0s)]
*  He's famously smart. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  He probably understands that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=3.84s)]
*  But what is it like to run a digital media property [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=5.12s)]
*  that's maybe out of step with the hurt? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=8.92s)]
*  Well, Dave Portnoy has been doing that for a long time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=11.92s)]
*  He funded Barstool Sports, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=13.96s)]
*  and we thought it'd be worth asking him what it's like. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=15.0s)]
*  So, Dave Portnoy, you don't run a political site, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=17.64s)]
*  but you don't want to be controlled. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=20.2s)]
*  They've gone after your personal life. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=22.6s)]
*  They really actually tried to destroy you for real. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=24.52s)]
*  What do you think Elon Musk is in for? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=27.52s)]
*  Well, he has one big advantage over me. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=31.28s)]
*  He controls now Twitter, and he's the ultimate say. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=33.32s)]
*  But, you know, Elon said something that rung true to me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=35.6s)]
*  He said if you're running this correctly, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=39.44s)]
*  it's 10% on each side are gonna hate you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=41.28s)]
*  And that's the thing about this whole Elon Musk [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=44.16s)]
*  buying Twitter, and I, even when I come on the show, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=46.56s)]
*  you know, Tucker, I always say, people think I'm political, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=50.28s)]
*  but all the complaining is from one side. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=52.92s)]
*  It's all from one side, it's not from the other. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=55.16s)]
*  You just want an even playing field. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=57.36s)]
*  If somebody says something about you, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=58.92s)]
*  you want the ability to respond. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=60.88s)]
*  What I find happens, you know, there's people, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=62.68s)]
*  I'll make up a name, Julia Hack. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=64.76s)]
*  There's people like this, they'll throw shots at you, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=66.64s)]
*  and when you respond on Twitter, they have an army of bots, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=69.68s)]
*  people who say harassment, harassment, harassment, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=73.0s)]
*  and they get you banned. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=75.76s)]
*  So they throw all the arrows, and if you respond [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=76.88s)]
*  in kind once, or defend yourself, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=79.24s)]
*  you get banned, or you get in trouble. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=81.48s)]
*  I think that is essentially what spurred this on for Elon, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=83.08s)]
*  because he got muted, and he's just saying, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=86.92s)]
*  hey, let's open a playing field, exchange of ideas. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=89.16s)]
*  I don't think anybody's saying somebody should run around [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=91.84s)]
*  and be like, I wanna kill your mom, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=94.08s)]
*  I wanna kill your mom, I wanna kill your mom. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=95.2s)]
*  No, but if you have an idea, a thought, you criticize, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=96.72s)]
*  the other side is allowed to respond. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=100.64s)]
*  But the good news is, he's the ultimate guy, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=103.68s)]
*  he's the ultimate gangster. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=105.84s)]
*  I've said a million times, I wish I could be him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=106.88s)]
*  If you don't like me, you don't like what's going on, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm just gonna buy you up and let it run, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  and he said something very key in a piece [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  you played earlier, it's not about economics. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=115.76s)]
*  So, I mean, how much of that is true, I'm not sure, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=118.12s)]
*  because everything he touches is gold, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=120.84s)]
*  but the major thing, whenever you look, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  why is one side all complaining and the other side isn't? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=126.04s)]
*  That to me tells everything. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=129.36s)]
*  Give people a level playing field, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=131.56s)]
*  that's all anybody wants, the ability to speak back [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=133.08s)]
*  and debate points. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=136.32s)]
*  But why is that, I mean, what you've said [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=138.16s)]
*  is the definition of fairness, it's how we conduct sports, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=139.96s)]
*  and business at its best, why is that such a threat [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=144.12s)]
*  when it takes place in the media? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=147.8s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't think there's an illusion of fairness, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=150.0s)]
*  but there is no fairness going around it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=154.36s)]
*  There's that account, Defiant L's, Business Insider, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=156.56s)]
*  they had a tweet that said how great it was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=159.52s)]
*  that Jeff Bezos was buying the Washington Post. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  Now they had a tweet that said this is the end [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=165.44s)]
*  of civilization because Elon Musk is buying Twitter. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=167.4s)]
*  It just depends what you're looking for. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=170.4s)]
*  But the key thing is there is no fairness. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=172.4s)]
*  Anybody who's paying attention, there's nothing fair. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=175.32s)]
*  There's the illusion of fairness and woe is me, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=177.72s)]
*  we're trying to be fair, but anybody who's paid [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  an ounce of attention knows each platform [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  specifically leans certain ways. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=185.12s)]
*  And you know what the craziest thing is? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=187.16s)]
*  Like Instagram or the Facebook or Zuckerberg, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=189.36s)]
*  I feel like they censor 10X what Twitter does. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=192.16s)]
*  They all do it and they all lean certain ways, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=194.8s)]
*  but there's nothing wrong with fairness, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  but you're an idiot if you think these are neutral [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=199.84s)]
*  platforms any more so than certain newspapers [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=203.24s)]
*  lean certain ways or even Fox News or CNN. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=206.12s)]
*  If you think those two are looking at every subject [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=209.4s)]
*  down the middle, well, your head is in the sand [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=212.0s)]
*  and it's the same with Twitter. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=214.28s)]
*  Right, all you can ask for is clarity [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=216.04s)]
*  and giving other people the opportunity to respond. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=220.16s)]
*  And that's what he's promising. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=224.04s)]
*  And if you literally listen to anything Elon has said, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=225.0s)]
*  I don't know why anybody on either side [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=228.72s)]
*  would have a problem with it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=230.68s)]
*  He's literally saying he wants to play dead down the middle [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  and wants 10% on both sides to be like, this is wrong, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=234.84s)]
*  that's how he knows he's been doing right. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=238.32s)]
*  I've never heard anything political about Elon. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=239.96s)]
*  I think it blows down, you know what, as simple as it is, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=242.0s)]
*  as stupid as it is, he's gonna bring back Trump. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=244.52s)]
*  I think that's a lot of what people are freaking out about. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  No, I think you're absolutely right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  Dave Portnett, great to see you tonight. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhix3Q6S-Ew&t=254.48000000000002s)]
