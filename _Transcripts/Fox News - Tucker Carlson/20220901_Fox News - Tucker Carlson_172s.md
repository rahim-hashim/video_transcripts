# Attorney: This is why we're suing AMEX
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [September 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs)
*  Well, it's so common that you barely notice it, but the biggest companies in the country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=0.0s)]
*  discriminate openly against their employees on the basis of skin color. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=3.18s)]
*  They call that equity. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=6.74s)]
*  It's racism. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=7.74s)]
*  But it's everywhere. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=8.96s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=9.96s)]
*  What's changing is that some employees are now fighting back. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=10.96s)]
*  Brian Netzel, who worked for a decade at Amex until he was fired in 2020, just filed a class [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  action lawsuit against the company. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=19.56s)]
*  He says that American Express, quote, gave preferential treatment to individuals for [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=21.6s)]
*  being black and unambiguously signaled to white employees that their race was an impediment [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=25.5s)]
*  to getting ahead in the company. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=30.9s)]
*  Again, that's happening everywhere. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=33.46s)]
*  And here's someone who's taking it to court. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  David Piftorak is the lawyer in this case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  He represents Netzel and he joins us tonight. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=42.54s)]
*  Mr. Piftorak, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=44.66s)]
*  So I'm not a lawyer, but it does seem that this is unambiguously illegal, correct? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely, Tucker. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=55.06s)]
*  It's unlawful. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=56.06s)]
*  It's been illegal since at least the 1960s, since the passage of the Civil Rights Act. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=58.18s)]
*  But the reason that this is happening is because back in the summer of St. Floyd in 2020, a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  lot of these corporations, they saw that the BLM rioters were allowed to burn down entire [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=70.3s)]
*  cities with absolutely zero consequences because it was in the name of social justice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=74.98s)]
*  So why wouldn't the companies be emboldened to treat their white employees like second-class [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=81.04s)]
*  citizens violate the most fundamental civil rights laws in this country when we see this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  precedent that was happening for several years now? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Companies want to do all kinds of crazy things, but then the U.S. government pushes them back [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  within the bounds of the law. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  That's why we have a Justice Department which has a civil rights division whose whole purpose [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  is to prevent racial discrimination in the workplace. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  Have they said anything about this? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=109.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=111.92s)]
*  We filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is the administrative [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=113.08s)]
*  arm of the government that's supposed to be handling stuff like this and go after companies [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=119.64s)]
*  like American Express, like a lot of these companies like Uber and Chase and a lot of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=123.74s)]
*  these other companies that are instigating these policies, but they just don't enforce [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=130.84s)]
*  it because again, it's done in the name of quote social justice. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=137.22s)]
*  They think it's benign discrimination, which you know, the late Justice Scalia said is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=142.1s)]
*  never the case. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=148.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=150.1s)]
*  Well, racism is always wrong no matter who is being hurt by it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=151.1s)]
*  And it's as wrong in this case as it ever was in any other case. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=155.02s)]
*  And so we're certainly rooting for you to prevail. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=157.84s)]
*  I appreciate you coming on tonight, David. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHUp04wrOs&t=159.26s)]
