# This is the Left's religion: Chadwick Moore
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus)
*  Chadwick Moore is a columnist with The Spectator and he joins me now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, Chadwick, OK, give it to me. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=4.0s)]
*  Is this an act of love or is this really just about consequence-free sex? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=6.08s)]
*  I mean, why stop at the vasectomy? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=11.68s)]
*  I think it just lobbed the whole thing off and become trans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=13.8s)]
*  That's what you should do if you really love your wife and want to show her what a supporter [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=16.52s)]
*  of womanhood you are and of the female cause. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=20.54s)]
*  I would also wonder, I would love to see how the Washington Post and this reporter, who [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=23.96s)]
*  is clearly a bit too excited about the idea of men being mutilated in a clinical setting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=28.3s)]
*  unnecessarily, how would she react if women were doing the same thing? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=35.300000000000004s)]
*  If there were a trend of women that were getting their tubes tied to show how much they loved [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=39.34s)]
*  their husbands, and maybe that's not such a bad idea, how would they react to that? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=43.260000000000005s)]
*  Of course, we know it would be, you know, these women are horrible and self-hating, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=47.86s)]
*  and of course we can laugh at these men who are doing this as well. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=52.58s)]
*  And it fits perfectly in line. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=57.06s)]
*  I mean, consequence-free sex is what drives the left. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  It's their religion. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  It fuels almost everything they do. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=63.46s)]
*  And of course they believe in population control. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=65.18s)]
*  They want fewer people on the planet. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=68.22s)]
*  Of course, populations aren't growing in rich Western countries except by illegal immigration. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=70.14s)]
*  So I wonder how, if you were to take this to parts of the world where the population [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=75.9s)]
*  is exploding, like in, I don't know, Sub-Saharan Africa or Central America, I wonder how those [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=80.18s)]
*  men would react to being told that they should have a vasectomy to show how much they love [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=86.0s)]
*  their women. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=90.24s)]
*  Well, Chadwick, isn't this really good politics? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=91.24s)]
*  Because if you have all these woke, liberal men in bike shorts that get vasectomies and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  not have kids, but you have conservative men like me who have nine kids, isn't that great [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=99.36s)]
*  because you have conservatives being born and you're not even having liberals not having [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  kids? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Good politics. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's why we're not, like, super mad about it, right? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  Because they're just not breeding, and that's fine. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=113.56s)]
*  I hope that these men get a free box set of Harry Potter when they go in for their snip [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=115.64s)]
*  and some soylents and whatever else they like to do with their free time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  Fine, if that's what you want to do, go for it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=123.96s)]
*  But it does make you less of a man. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=127.24s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=129.84s)]
*  So, Chadwick, you saw the video of AOC who's out there saying, listen, we want to save [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=130.84s)]
*  the environment, and so let's not have kids. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=136.12s)]
*  Give me your take on AOC saying don't have kids, save the environment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=139.04s)]
*  Well, this is something, I mean, at least they're finally out in the open with this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  The left has sort of secretly been saying this for a long time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=147.24s)]
*  They really think that the way to save the planet is fewer people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=150.08s)]
*  Of course, that doesn't sound very nice, but they've become so brazen lately with [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=154.08s)]
*  what they truly believe and what they're truly about. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=158.36s)]
*  They've really kind of gone off the deep end. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  I think she's saying what she's been learning in college and what has been circulating around [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=163.84s)]
*  the Progressive Caucus for a very long time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=167.68s)]
*  They want fewer people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=170.72s)]
*  They want less people. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=172.16s)]
*  And there's many ways to do that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  This one just sounds a little nicer than other tactics that the left has tried in the past [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=176.28s)]
*  and sadly successfully tried in the past. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=181.08s)]
*  Hey, Chadwick, some would say save the world, have no kids. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=184.08s)]
*  Others would say save America, have less liberals. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=188.0s)]
*  But listen, hey, thank you for joining me tonight. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=190.24s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Df2SyvQJus&t=192.36s)]
