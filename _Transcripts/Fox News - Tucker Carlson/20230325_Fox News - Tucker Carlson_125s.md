# The Trump probe is about these lies: Alan Dershowitz
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [March 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY)
*  Alan Dershowitz, formerly of Harvard, author of Get Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=0.0s)]
*  The Threat to Civil Liberties, Due Process, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=2.84s)]
*  and our Constitutional Rule of Law. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=4.48s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz joins us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=6.08s)]
*  Professor, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=7.68s)]
*  And with that introduction, I do think you're a credible [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=9.8s)]
*  assessor of the case against the Republican front-runner [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  in New York. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=17.68s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=18.52s)]
*  Well, first of all, I just got a tweet or a note [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=20.88s)]
*  from Donald Trump himself in which he endorsed my book, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=23.76s)]
*  urged everybody to read it, but he says, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=27.2s)]
*  Alan enjoys saying, I didn't vote for Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=29.2s)]
*  I believe he probably did. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=32.88s)]
*  He just uses that phrase for added credibility, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=34.8s)]
*  but it doesn't matter. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=37.76s)]
*  He's a brilliant guy and you should read his book. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=38.68s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=41.0s)]
*  I never mixed politics and my constitutional analysis. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=42.6s)]
*  Get Trump is a book about lying. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=47.28s)]
*  It's all about lying. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  It's about the four lies that have resulted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=51.16s)]
*  in four investigations, including doctoring a tape, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=54.32s)]
*  which is of course what the January 6th committee did [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=59.44s)]
*  when it left out the words, peacefully and patriotically. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=61.16s)]
*  It's about Michael Cohen, who may be the world's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=64.88s)]
*  biggest liar, he gets all the Pinocchios [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=67.8s)]
*  and the district attorney is making a very hard decision [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=70.32s)]
*  now, does he put his bar at risk, his bar certificate [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  at risk by putting on the stand the man he knows [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=77.24s)]
*  is gonna lie in violation of the rules of ethics? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=81.32s)]
*  So it's all about lying. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  My book Get Trump, documents lie after lie. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=86.84s)]
*  The so-called liberals, they're not liberals, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=90.8s)]
*  they're radicals, will do anything, stretch the constitution, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  destroy the constitution to prevent Trump [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  from running for president. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=100.44s)]
*  And it's degrading to our country and to all of us. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=102.84s)]
*  I appreciate your writing this book. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=106.0s)]
*  I know you paid quite a personal cost [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=107.2s)]
*  for saying things like this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=109.0s)]
*  And we appreciate your coming on. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudTpm0GeFY&t=110.48s)]
