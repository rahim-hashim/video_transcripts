# Here's how the political left is aliening its base: Colin Wright
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [May 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI)
*  So suddenly the same kind of nihilism you're seeing in our foreign policy, we don't care what happens, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=0.0s)]
*  you're seeing applied to our domestic policy and even to questions of science. So the people in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=4.8s)]
*  charge are telling you that biological sex isn't real and if you disagree you're a racist. Now for [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=9.76s)]
*  a lot of lifelong Democrats this is bewildering, they didn't sign up for this. Colin Wright's been [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=14.8s)]
*  a Democrat all his life, didn't sign up for this. So a year ago he came up with a cartoon to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=18.96s)]
*  illustrate what he thought was going on. He hasn't changed but the people who represent him in the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Democratic Party have become very unreasonable. Elon Musk agrees he just shared this cartoon on [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=27.28s)]
*  Twitter. In Wall Street Journal op-ed, Colin Wright explained that he made the cartoon to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=32.24s)]
*  kind of sort out how he feels as a lifelong Democrat. Colin Wright is an evolutionary [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=36.88s)]
*  biologist and we're happy to have him join us tonight. Colin thanks so much for coming on. So [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=41.68s)]
*  you can describe this better than I can paraphrase. Why did you draw this cartoon? What does it mean? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=45.44s)]
*  Yes, so I drew this cartoon in bed one night in my pajamas because I had this increasing feeling of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  alienation from the political left on a lot of core values that I felt were central to who I was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=58.32s)]
*  as a voter. So on issues such as free speech for instance that I think the left had held as being [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=64.32s)]
*  sacrosanct for much of its history. You know, it's been, these values of free speech were [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=70.96s)]
*  generally held to be like these core values in order to uphold free speech, to speak truth to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=80.24s)]
*  power and it's being increasingly viewed as sort of... Well it's unacceptable. I mean people are [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  being called racist for wanting free speech. I mean you keep hearing that. Is that when you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=95.28s)]
*  signed up as a liberal or a Democrat or you thought the Democratic party represented you [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  even five years ago, would it have been plausible that somebody in MSNBC would say you're racist if [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=105.04s)]
*  you want free speech? Well no, see it's being increasingly viewed as hostile to the government, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=110.72s)]
*  as being hostile to, you know, these ideas that we have of free speech and on issues such as like [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=118.08s)]
*  racism for instance where the previous values that we had of judging people by the conduct of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=125.04s)]
*  their character for instance rather than by, you know, the color of their skin. This has been [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=129.52s)]
*  replaced by these sort of identity politics and equity initiatives that are really valuing group [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=134.32s)]
*  identity over individual rights. And then on the issues of women's rights for instance, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  we see, you know, and I don't think the right has been always the best or most consistent [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=147.12s)]
*  on these issues, but at least the right knows what a woman is, you know, as an adult human female. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=151.04s)]
*  And I say this as a biologist, so I say that with certainty. The left on the other hand, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=156.72s)]
*  you know, they can't even tell you what a woman is, so they can't even really pretend [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=161.12s)]
*  to understand or to protect women's rights. So this is the kind of my growing feeling of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  being disaffected from the left on these many issues and I think a lot of Americans and people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=170.56s)]
*  abroad feel the same way. I think that, you know, people abroad too, I agree with that, it's not [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  just in this country. The world takes its cues from us, the West does, and they're shocked by it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=178.64s)]
*  Colin Wright, thank you for that. If you liked that conversation, we had a long conversation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=183.44s)]
*  with Colin Wright for an episode of Tucker Carlson Today. You can check it out on Fox Nation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqYubrW2NI&t=187.04s)]
