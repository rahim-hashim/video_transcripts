# Democrats hell-bent on authoritarian power: Missouri attorney general
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [December 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w)
*  Eric Schmidt is one of the few who is taking active steps to stop this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the attorney general of the state of Missouri. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Missouri is leading a coalition of states that have just obtained an injunction against [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=5.8s)]
*  Joe Biden's vaccine mandate for health care workers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=10.1s)]
*  He joins us tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=12.76s)]
*  Mr. Attorney General, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=13.76s)]
*  I appreciate this, again, since you're one of so few office holders who are standing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  up for the citizens of this country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=21.0s)]
*  Tell us where we are tonight with your effort to stop these mandates. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, in your monologue, you hit the nail on the head here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=28.2s)]
*  This has never been about facts or science or data. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=31.88s)]
*  It's about aggregating power and control, and they want to exercise it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=35.04s)]
*  If the left had it their way, you'd have Lord Fauci in his black turtleneck and his tweed [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=39.28s)]
*  jacket dictating how we live our lives. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  But thankfully, this is still American. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=47.16s)]
*  We've got to push back, because I don't know about you, Tucker, I know how you feel about [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=48.64s)]
*  this, but I don't want to live in some futuristic dystopian biomedical security state. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=52.4s)]
*  America has been the freest country in the history of the world because we believe in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=58.04s)]
*  individual rights. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=60.82s)]
*  We believe that when you diffuse power, it allows people to pursue their dreams. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=61.82s)]
*  Why these lawsuits are so important. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=65.84s)]
*  So just this week, we led a 10-state coalition that won against Joe Biden, against his federal [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=67.32s)]
*  vaccine mandate against health care workers. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=72.6s)]
*  There is no statutory or constitutional authority for any of this stuff. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  They're making it up as they go along. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=78.66s)]
*  So we're going to court and we're winning because, in my view, the future of this country [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=80.2s)]
*  is at stake. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=84.64s)]
*  Who we are, who we've been, what kind of country we're going to be, and we've got to fight [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=85.64s)]
*  back on every front, every single day. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=89.12s)]
*  So are you, since you are an attorney, well, you're the attorney general, of course, of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=92.4s)]
*  a major American state, I mean, how did Rochelle Walensky, who has been a demonstrable failure [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=96.48s)]
*  as CDC director, more people have died under her than the last CDC director, so you failed, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=103.68s)]
*  okay, with its kind of beyond debate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=107.72s)]
*  How did she wind up with Intel agency-level surveillance powers over American citizens? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=110.08s)]
*  I'm completely confused by this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=116.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I think what we have to understand is that the left is hell-bent on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=119.12s)]
*  authoritarian-like power. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=127.18s)]
*  And the good news here is our founders, like, they were great students of human nature. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=130.44s)]
*  They had seen, you know, how tyrants and dictators and these authoritarian regimes [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=136.32s)]
*  throughout history aggregated power. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=140.88s)]
*  So their system was, hey, separation of powers, checks and balances, federalism, right, so [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=142.5s)]
*  that you diffuse this power so individuals have rights, they can pursue their dreams, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=147.88s)]
*  they can pursue happiness. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  That is not the left's vision of America right now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=153.64s)]
*  They believe in command and control. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=156.78s)]
*  So we're not having debates about, you know, like, what's the tax rate or, you know, these [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  kind of traditional political debates. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  We're having a big debate here, Tucker, about who we are, what this country is going to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=165.7s)]
*  look like a generation from now and right now because you played the clip from Australia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=170.5s)]
*  Look, people are being arrested in parts of the world right now for not wearing masks [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  in a park. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=180.2s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=181.2s)]
*  And that's the vision of America for the left. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  So we have to fight back and we have to be, as Republicans, as conservatives, we have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=185.54s)]
*  to fight back against this stuff and reclaim. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=190.16s)]
*  I mean, Americans want America back. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=193.46s)]
*  They want to get back to living their lives and they can do it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=195.96s)]
*  But we got to put a stop to this hypocrisy that's happening and these elites ruling [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  from on high trying to dictate what, where, if we can go to work that day, we can go outside [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  of our house, what you have to put on your face. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=207.8s)]
*  That's not what America's about and why these legal battles are so important. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=210.02s)]
*  No, yeah, that's right. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=213.86s)]
*  Rochelle Lewinsky has no right to spy on you as an American citizen, period. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=215.74s)]
*  And we should all do everything we can to resist this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=220.28s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=221.94s)]
*  Mr. Attorney General, thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=222.98s)]
*  Eric Schmidt of Missouri. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=223.98s)]
*  Thanks, Doctor. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asr08x1wE9w&t=226.14s)]
