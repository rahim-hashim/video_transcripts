# Kyle Rittenhouse tells Tucker his future plans
**Fox News - Tucker Carlson:** [November 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA)
*  So we're about 45 minutes into our interview with Kyle Rittenhouse, and the picture that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=0.0s)]
*  emerges is of a working class kid who sincerely believes in America. His community falls apart, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=4.0s)]
*  and he tries his best to do the right thing at a time when almost nobody else in the community [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=10.68s)]
*  is trying to do the right thing, but he does. And in return for that, the state, under political [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=14.94s)]
*  pressure, throws him in prison. Then the people who swear they will help him take advantage [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=19.2s)]
*  of him. That's a lot. So what does he plan to do now, now that he's been acquitted? Well, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=24.24s)]
*  here's that part of the interview. What do you think your life's going to be like after [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=31.24s)]
*  this? I'm hoping I can live a quiet, stress-free life, and be free of any intimidation or harassment, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=37.04s)]
*  and just go on with my life as a normal 18-year-old kid attending college. So you're going to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=47.72s)]
*  go to college? I am in college. I'm a student at Arizona State University. I mean, are you [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=53.6s)]
*  going to go to campus? I think I am. I want to. It's a lot of things we have to look into, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=59.88s)]
*  so I don't know for sure yet, but I do intend on going in campus and pursuing a career in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  nursing. I may change it. I've been looking into law. I may want to become a lawyer. I [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=73.08s)]
*  haven't completely decided yet, but I've been looking. I want to be a nurse, so I've been [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=78.08s)]
*  doing the prerequisites for that. Interesting. Do you think you can have that, that you can [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=83.64s)]
*  live peacefully in this country, unmolested? I hope so, but I can't read the future. I'm [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  hoping that people go back and understand the facts and be like, watch the trial, watch [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=97.32s)]
*  the prosecutorial misconduct that I believe happened, and realize that I was an innocent [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=103.22s)]
*  17-year-old who was violently attacked and defended myself. Because you wanted to clean [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=109.66s)]
*  graffiti and protect a car lot. And apparently, a lot of people on the left, it's criminal [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=115.34s)]
*  to want to protect your community. Do you feel like your life's been destroyed by this? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  I feel my life has been extremely defamed by it. I don't think I would be able to go [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=127.18s)]
*  out and get a job and not have to deal with harassment, but I'm at a place now to where [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=132.82s)]
*  I have to have people with me because people want to kill me just because I defended myself, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=142.18s)]
*  and they're too ignorant to look at the facts of what happened. Do you feel the threats? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=148.7s)]
*  I do. I see some of the threats. Some of the things people say, it's absolutely sickening. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=155.78s)]
*  Are you confident that the government will protect you from these threats? Because that's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=162.94s)]
*  of course the government's job. I hope so, but we all know how the FBI works. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=165.62s)]
*  Looking back, it's been a year and a half, less than even. This is not the life that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=174.74s)]
*  you planned, obviously. No. It is far from the life I planned. This is something that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=183.22s)]
*  I wish never would have happened, but it did, and we can't change that. How it polarized [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=190.62s)]
*  it became is absolutely sickening. Right or left, people are using me for a cause that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=202.02s)]
*  should never have been used as a cause. I read that you're not going to stay in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=209.46s)]
*  Midwest. I'm not. I'm going to find somewhere to live. Before this, I actually wanted to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  move to Naples, Florida, and then this happened. I don't know where I'm going to go. I'm going [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=219.46s)]
*  to go lay low and live my life and enjoy it. Why are you so calm? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm a naturally calm person. I find it to be a problem when people are overreacting, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  because things are out of our control. I try not to deal with that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=240.18s)]
*  Huh. Believe me, on the inside I'm freaking out. For the record, you just got acquitted [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=245.9s)]
*  two days ago. That was the first thing I noticed, that you seem very calm. You don't seem like [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=255.74s)]
*  someone who's just been through, had his mind blown. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=261.62s)]
*  Yeah, on the inside I'm freaking out, but the best thing you can do, you freak out, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=266.14s)]
*  everybody else freaks out. It's like a chain reaction. So the best thing I can do is stay [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=270.18s)]
*  calm. Do you feel like you've been watched over? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  I believe God's been on my side through the beginning. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  I'd imagine you could have watched the whole trial and then watched those 48 minutes and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  come away thinking Kyle Rittenhouse is a monster. Just the opposite, actually. As we said, this [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=289.58s)]
*  is a boy who sincerely believed in the promises of America. Do the right thing, be honest, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=294.62s)]
*  worked hard to turn himself into the police. Their response? They pepper sprayed him. He [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=301.74s)]
*  had to drive across state lines, speaking up, to turn himself into the police. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=306.42s)]
*  It's an amazing story, and it's a deeply sad story for what it says, not about him, but [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=310.14s)]
*  about the rest of us. We've got reactions tonight to the interview we just did from Judge [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=314.38s)]
*  Jeanine Peer. We've also got behind the scenes footage that we shot, our producer shot for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=318.14s)]
*  our documentary series, behind the scenes at the Rittenhouse trial. That's all next. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L33XDGdYaGA&t=322.38s)]
