# “Biden Wasn’t Running the Country.” Speaker Mike Johnson on the Biden Cover-Up
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0)
*  From the free press, live in DC and presented by Uber and X, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=0.0s)]
*  Being Republican House Speaker is a little bit like marrying Henry VIII. At some point, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=7.2s)]
*  your head will be chopped off. But for now, Mike Johnson looks physically intact and also is in a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=12.4s)]
*  position of incredible power. Two weeks ago, Johnson was re-elected Speaker of the House on [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=17.92s)]
*  the first ballot, which is saying something. Despite having only the narrowest of House [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=23.36s)]
*  majorities, he was able to unite the various factions of the warring Republican Party. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=28.0s)]
*  The moderates, the Freedom Caucus, the Raw Milk Caucus, the Libertarians, the Hawks, the Doves, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=33.6s)]
*  and whatever we call Lauren Boebert. It was a tough thing to pull off and it would only have [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  taken a couple no votes to send him to that Republican Valhalla where John Boehner chains [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=43.84s)]
*  smokes and chugs Merlot, Paul Ryan does his pushups, and Kevin McCarthy throws darts at a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=48.72s)]
*  photo of Matt Gaetz. Now, Donald Trump will become President of the United States very shortly and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=53.84s)]
*  Mike Johnson, you, will have the thankless task, arguably, of shepherding his agenda through [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  Congress. And because the Republicans control the House by only four seats, you're going to have to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  get close, I think, to some moderate Democrats, particularly those with constituents looking for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=72.0s)]
*  a tax cut. So, Speaker Johnson, officially, thanks for joining me on Honestly and thanks for making [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=77.2s)]
*  the time on this busy weekend. Thanks, Barry. It's a great delight. That's a very unique [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=82.4s)]
*  introduction. I haven't had one like that in a while. Thank you so much. You like the visual [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  of Paul Ryan doing the P90X or whatever it's called? Very accurate, yes. First simple question, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=89.76s)]
*  why do you want this job? Great question. This might sound hokey to you, but I feel called to it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=95.68s)]
*  It's not an easy job. I mean, Newt Gingrich, who was a predecessor, of course, the most famous [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=102.72s)]
*  speaker still in my mind of the modern era, wrote an op-ed a few months back and said, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=107.2s)]
*  poor Johnson has the most challenging speakership since the Civil War, and he noted all the reasons [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=111.52s)]
*  for that. It's a challenging time, but it's also a time of great opportunity for the nation. And [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=115.92s)]
*  we feel the weight of that, not in a burdensome way, but we understand that we're at a precipice [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  as a nation. This election cycle was a big turning point, I think. I think we have an opportunity to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  fix things, to get back to common sense, and I'm excited by that. So, there are great challenges, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=132.8s)]
*  great opportunity at the same time, but I'm convinced we're going to be able to deliver on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=138.48s)]
*  this and we're going to do well for the country, so that's why we're here. Since your predecessor, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=141.84s)]
*  John Boehner, was pushed out of the speakership in 2015, then we had Paul Ryan, then we had Kevin [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  McCarthy, it's a lot of drama and a lot of chaos. You look at the other side of the aisle, and Nancy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=151.12s)]
*  Pelosi was able to run things with an iron fist. What is it about Republicans that make them so [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=156.72s)]
*  ungovernable or hard to harness? You know, that's a really good question. I was asked that question [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=163.2s)]
*  a lot of times over the last year. We had a big election cycle, and so every day that we were not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=170.48s)]
*  in session, almost literally, I was on the road. So, I did over 350 campaign events, 250 cities, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=176.0s)]
*  40 states, logged enough miles to circle the globe five and a half times, campaigning to keep the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=181.6s)]
*  majority. And we did by a narrow margin, but it was a success. But no matter where I was coast to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=185.76s)]
*  coast, this is a common question. How come, how come the Democrats stick together and Republicans [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=191.04s)]
*  don't? And here's my answer, and I think it will make sense to you. Democrats really are consistent [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  in their philosophy. They think very much and operate very much like a union. They're very [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=201.04s)]
*  collectivist, sort of in their worldview and their ideology. They move together as a pack. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=205.84s)]
*  It almost is kind of a, they're all sort of social animals. It's socialism, it's in some real respect. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Whereas on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans are by nature more independent, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=216.48s)]
*  you know, rugged individualists and deeply rooted in our philosophy, and you can tell me what to do [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=220.88s)]
*  and all that stuff. And that's great. I mean, there's great blessing to that. I'm one of those [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=225.68s)]
*  people as well, until you have a one vote margin, and then you need everybody to move together. And [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=229.36s)]
*  so that is the challenge every day. I mean, the modern speakership has evolved to where [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=233.84s)]
*  the margins are so small, and they're going to be for the foreseeable future, no matter who has the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=239.36s)]
*  majority. You can't spare hardly any votes, or sometimes no votes. And so you have to operate [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=243.12s)]
*  sort of like a mental health counselor. I mean, no kidding. I spend the large share of my day [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=249.76s)]
*  sitting down with members, working through their issues, helping them come to consensus. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=255.12s)]
*  And so we have to bury our personal preferences sometimes, because we're in a deliberative body. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  That's the nature of the beast. But I'll never ask anybody to compromise their core principles. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=263.92s)]
*  And that's the fine line where you've got to sort of navigate. Come with me, you're not going to get [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=268.16s)]
*  all that. None of us are. But you've got to be part of the team. And that's a great challenge [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=272.08s)]
*  some days. So as someone that's trying to manage a team of disagreeable misfits myself, what advice [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=276.24s)]
*  do you have for me? Well, seriously, I was asked this on a podcast several days ago. How do you do [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=281.68s)]
*  it? This is such a great challenge. I mean, how do you just not pull your hair out? How do you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  maintain composure? Like, look at your hair. Yeah, right. Well, it's going gray quickly. I'm aging [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=292.24s)]
*  prematurely in this job. This is really genuinely how I sort of operate my worldview is that you [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=297.52s)]
*  have to actually have love for your colleagues, you know, love everybody. This is a biblical [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=303.68s)]
*  admonition. I'm one of those guys. And if you really take hold of what that means, it allows you to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=307.2s)]
*  have a lot of tolerance for people, a lot of empathy, sympathy, whatever is occasioned of the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  day. And you can see past their frustrations and peccadilloes. And even when they come after you [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=317.68s)]
*  personally, you can forgive it and not keep a record of wrongs. These are all biblical admonitions. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  If you follow that, it's a very liberating way to live. And because I genuinely love all my [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=326.96s)]
*  colleagues, I understand what they bring to the table. I appreciate their skill sets, their life [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=332.4s)]
*  experiences, all these things. And I'm trying to leverage that because I want them to be of their [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  highest and best use for the cause and the country and our caucus, our conference. But also, they've [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  got to be able to work cohesively with the team. It's easier with some than others, but that's the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  job. Well, let's talk about some of the others that you're referring to there. You've sort of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  obliquely referred to some of the show ponies in your party. And it's no secret that certain people, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm thinking of Chip Roy, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Thomas Massey, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=363.44s)]
*  they are the challenging wing of the party. How do you manage that group? I don't even know how [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=367.76s)]
*  they would identify themselves at this point, but they have brought down other speakers before you, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=374.96s)]
*  they and similar figures. How do you manage them? And frankly, and if there's a way to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=379.68s)]
*  characterize that group, what do they want? Well, I don't manage them. I work with them as a family. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=384.72s)]
*  We're kind of like a big family and families can be messy sometimes and dysfunctional sometimes. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=393.6s)]
*  But at the end of the day, everybody has the same objective. We're trying to do best for the country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  Those you named are all friends. I love and value them all, even when we disagree. And we can [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=402.48s)]
*  disagree in an agreeable manner. And that's what allows you to navigate through it. So, I understand [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=408.0s)]
*  where they're coming from. Chip Roy, for example, is a very good friend of mine. Like we disagree on [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=414.24s)]
*  tactics, but not necessarily on philosophy or principle. And so that tactics is where in the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=418.32s)]
*  deep south we say intense fellowship. We have a lot of intense fellowship. And Chip is very, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=423.92s)]
*  he gets very animated. He's very passionate about his principles, which I actually [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=429.12s)]
*  love and value about him. So we're not at odds personally. I'm not at odds personally with anybody. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=433.04s)]
*  And my job at the end of the day is take Chip and Thomas on this side and my colleagues who are [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=437.6s)]
*  elected in Kamala Harris districts, right, from New York and New Jersey and California and other [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=443.44s)]
*  places, and get them to the point where we can find consensus with the whole group. And it takes [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=448.24s)]
*  a lot of patience, a lot of time, but we can get everybody there and we will. You were elected [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=453.84s)]
*  speaker despite the obstinance of some in the more right-wing wing of your caucus. Yet you got [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=457.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's support. Why do you think he supported you? We have a great relationship. It's been [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  forged over and developed over about eight years. We came to Washington at the same time. I was a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=468.4s)]
*  freshman in Congress in 2017 when he was introduced to Washington. We've had a lot of experiences [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=472.96s)]
*  along the way. One day I'll write a three-volume set about all of this. That it's been developed [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  over a long time. I was one of his impeachment defense attorneys, you know, on the House side, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=486.96s)]
*  helped with all that. We had disagreements along the way over when he was president over a couple [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  of pieces of legislation and things. But even when we disagreed, he evaluated early on. He's a great [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=495.52s)]
*  judge of character and he understood that what I was telling him was in good faith. I was telling [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=501.12s)]
*  what I genuinely believed was for his best interest and thus the country's. And I was, you know, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=505.68s)]
*  I was resolute enough that I didn't just, you know, fold. I told him what I thought I needed to know. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  He appreciates that. And so we've become very close over the last, you know, certainly in recent [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=517.52s)]
*  years. And during the campaign over the last year, we talked all the time. I mean, now we talk almost [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=522.88s)]
*  constantly. And I think that's a really important thing for the country. It's very important for the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=529.36s)]
*  president of the United States and the Speaker of the House, certainly of the same party, to have a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=533.36s)]
*  close working relationship and one of trust. And I think that's what this is based upon. And he's had [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  my back and I've had his. And, you know, I'm humbled and honored to have had his endorsement in sport. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=542.48s)]
*  It's a great working relationship. I think it's really important for the country. It's different [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=548.72s)]
*  in many ways. And the relationship he had, for example, with Paul Ryan, who was the speaker in [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=552.0s)]
*  2017, they really didn't know one another. And so they were sort of being introduced at a very [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=556.16s)]
*  important time for the country. No one thought we would have unified government in 2017. So he [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=562.48s)]
*  surprised everyone, including the leadership in the House and Senate. And so they had to forge that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=566.56s)]
*  relationship through fire, through the process. We don't have that hurdle right now. And he and I [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=571.12s)]
*  think very much very the same. We're going to work the same way to deliver that America First agenda. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=576.16s)]
*  And that's what the country needs. You told the New Yorker that you were the first [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=581.92s)]
*  genuinely pro-Trump Republican congressional leader. What does that say about Kevin McCarthy [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=585.84s)]
*  and Mitch McConnell? Well, they said that about me. I didn't say it about myself. That's how it was [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=590.96s)]
*  carried out. I wouldn't discount anybody's previous relationship. McCarthy was very close to the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  president. But all I know is that the relationship I have with him right now, we're very much aligned [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=600.96s)]
*  on the principle and the policy. And I think it's going to be very important for us to deliver. I [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=608.08s)]
*  mean, he got a big mandate in this election. Let's not forget 77 million votes. The House [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=611.68s)]
*  Republicans got 74.7 million. That's the highest vote total, popular vote we've ever had for House [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=616.4799999999999s)]
*  Republicans. And some would say, well, you rode the president's coattails. I think it was a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=622.7199999999999s)]
*  combination of things. Certainly, he delivered for the party. He helped deliver for us. We had a [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  demographic shift in this election cycle. We have a record number of Hispanic and Latino voters and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=631.3599999999999s)]
*  Black and African American voters, Jewish voters, union workers, all that. He almost did a reset in [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  a way, not unlike what Reagan did in the early 80s. And now he's presented, we're all presented [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=640.96s)]
*  with this great opportunity to embrace the new folks who have come into the party and to demonstrate [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  for them that it is our policies that actually lead to human flourishing. Our policies are what's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  best. It's common sense. It's what's best for individuals and families and communities and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  the states and the nation itself. And so I just, I'm so excited by that prospect, the president is as [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=659.2s)]
*  well, and he's going to restore common sense. And I think that's the continuing theme that you'll see [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=664.72s)]
*  in our agenda. Those new voters that you referenced and people have paid a lot of attention, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=669.28s)]
*  especially to the minority vote and minority men that are going for Trump. Reaction against Biden [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=673.68s)]
*  and the, I don't even know how to characterize it, the dysfunction of a lot of the past four years or [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=678.72s)]
*  genuine enthusiasm for Trump? I think it's both. I think President Trump is a symbol to so many [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=684.72s)]
*  people, especially some of these demographics of just unabashed strength again. I mean, you know, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=690.9599999999999s)]
*  there's a lot of men who have felt like the Democratic party went so crazy woke progressive. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=697.12s)]
*  I mean, you know, you've written and thought a lot about this, that they just, it's as if the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=703.12s)]
*  pendulum was swung so far to the left so fast and aggressively that it went too far and it clicked. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=707.84s)]
*  It's almost like it's in my mind, it's sort of coming back. And so President Trump represents [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=713.6s)]
*  the force that's pushing it back in so many ways to so many people, because what is he? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=719.04s)]
*  He's brash by some people's description, but by others, that's a strong leader, that's a strong [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=723.2s)]
*  man. He's unafraid to say what he thinks. And it can be a blessing and a curse because sometimes [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=728.1600000000001s)]
*  he says things that rub people the wrong way, but he's not afraid to do it. And I think that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=734.64s)]
*  resonates with a lot of men, some of these demographics. I think they want to see that [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=738.5600000000001s)]
*  again. They want to see us restore peace through strength, for example, in foreign policy. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  And the Biden administration did exactly the opposite. They appeased our enemies. I mean, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=746.48s)]
*  look at Israel, the thing with Israel. I mean, they were appeasing Iran. They refused to confront [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=750.32s)]
*  Iran. And so what that did was it empowered them, Iran and its proxies, like Hamas, whereas they [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=755.0400000000001s)]
*  were encumbering Israel at the same time. They had it exactly inverted. And people see that in so [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=761.2s)]
*  many examples in so many policy arenas. And they said enough is enough. And so President Trump [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=765.7600000000001s)]
*  comes back with his style and bravado and he represents a strong America again in many ways. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=771.2s)]
*  And the country needs that desperately. There's been a lot of talk about, I want to get to foreign [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=776.4000000000001s)]
*  policy in a minute, because you could argue that there's a different kind of appeasement going on [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=780.16s)]
*  with this deal and the role of Qatar in this deal and the ways in which Qatar has, frankly, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=784.16s)]
*  bought a lot of people and influence in D.C. I want to talk about that in a second. Just sticking [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=790.24s)]
*  on domestic policy for a moment, this vibe shift, right? Mark Zuckerberg going on Joe Rogan, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=795.4399999999999s)]
*  getting rid of tampons in the men's bathrooms at Facebook, getting rid of DEI, unraveling it, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=801.28s)]
*  genuine change of heart or opportunism that you're seeing from a lot of these tech people? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=806.88s)]
*  Well, I can't judge these men's hearts, but I would tell you that they've done it 180 [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=812.16s)]
*  real quick. Obviously, this is about profitability. They run companies, right? So they've got to make [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=816.64s)]
*  sure that they're on steady footing with the new administration. But there were some incredible [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=825.52s)]
*  abuses in those spaces over the last four years. I came from the Judiciary Committee before I was [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=830.4s)]
*  elected speaker, and we were having hearings and we were collecting the data of all the abuses just [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=834.32s)]
*  in the tech space, on the social media platforms. There was a court opinion that came out from my [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=839.7600000000001s)]
*  state, the Western District of Louisiana Federal Court, July 4th, I think of 2022. And the judge [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=844.32s)]
*  detailed all this. It was about a 140-page court opinion, a summary judgment hearing at the time, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=852.0s)]
*  and he documented all the abuses from the tech platforms. Where Zuckerberg's talked about this [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=856.32s)]
*  in recent days, the Biden administration officials were cursing at him on the phone. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=861.68s)]
*  He was talking about vaccine mandates, for example. Any negative information about [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=866.4s)]
*  side effects from vaccines was scrubbed from the internet. The court looked at all this. They [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=870.4s)]
*  realized that Elvis Chan and the FBI office in Silicon Valley was meeting regularly with the [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=874.9599999999999s)]
*  big tech platform execs and demanding, giving them pages of people to censor in silence and viewpoints. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=879.28s)]
*  It's a dangerous thing. The judge said it was dystopian, Orwellian. He said it was the greatest [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=885.28s)]
*  abridgment of free speech since the First Amendment was drafted. That's big language for a [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=889.84s)]
*  court, but they just said how crazy this was. Do you think that someone like Mark Zuckerberg, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  I know you can't see into his heart, but do you think the people that, maybe you can, do you think [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=901.2s)]
*  that those people were sort of privately red-pilled and now feel like they have the cover to come out [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=906.0s)]
*  and be public about it? Well, maybe. Clearly, Elon was a big, sort of broke the gates open in [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  a way, but I've been out to Silicon Valley. I had fundraisers in San Francisco over the last [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=919.6s)]
*  cycle. I never thought that would ever happen, and all the big tech executives around the table [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=924.16s)]
*  saying, we're in. You know why it was- Who was around the table? I don't know if I should- I was [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  at David Sacks' house, I'll tell you that. He's now out, you know, so we can say that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=933.76s)]
*  There was a bunch of people, and it would surprise you, but some who have been kind of in conservative [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  circles for, you know, Lonsdale, for example, and Joe Lonsdale, and Mark Andreessen came and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=944.48s)]
*  spoke at a big event I had at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with all the biggest donors in the party, and he [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=949.84s)]
*  held a course, a master course on blockchain and crypto and AI and why, if you love freedom, you [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=954.16s)]
*  better be for blockchain, and they all went out, you know, cheering. It was great, because people- [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=961.04s)]
*  But this is before he came out publicly. Yeah, this probably didn't help with that. It probably [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=965.52s)]
*  got him out sooner, but here's what I think the dynamic was. It wasn't just Red Pill. They woke up [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=970.32s)]
*  and realized, wait a minute, the Democratic Party is trying to smother innovation in our industries. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=976.72s)]
*  They're trying to regulate us almost out of existence. Their tax policies are crazy. Our [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=982.72s)]
*  profitability is suffering. Oh, and here's this other group over here, and they're for the free [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=987.6s)]
*  market, and they want us to innovate, and they believe in entrepreneurship and risk-taking and [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=991.84s)]
*  job creation, and I think I'm with them. But then they also believe in economic protectionism [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=995.68s)]
*  and tariffs at the same time. Well, who's they? To me, the core tension right now in the GOP is, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1001.04s)]
*  and it's not saying anything unique, it's about its identity. What is it, right? Is it populist, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1010.2399999999999s)]
*  or is it free market? Is it about the collective, the kind of Orrin Cassian vision, or is it about, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1015.92s)]
*  total freedom for the individual? Is it more libertarian or not? Obviously, this has been [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1023.6800000000001s)]
*  typified or personified in the person of Steve Bannon and Elon Musk, which kind of represent [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1029.6000000000001s)]
*  these two new wings of the party. Do you see it that way? How do you maintain a big tent, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1035.92s)]
*  big enough to have genuinely conflicting visions of what the modern Republican Party ought to be [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1043.44s)]
*  about? I think a lot about this. In fact, I've been for about two years, I've been, I don't have [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1049.68s)]
*  any free time at all, but I'm dabbling and trying to finish my first book, and my wife is like, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1054.64s)]
*  finish it or you're done. Novel or? No, it's on this subject. I wish I had time for fiction. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1058.16s)]
*  This is, it's called the Seven Core Principles of American Conservatism, and the sub, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1064.48s)]
*  and it's got several subtitles. Let's work on the title. Let's work on the title. I know. I know. I [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1069.04s)]
*  can help you with that. I know. I'm kind of a nerd about this stuff, but this, I've been thinking [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1073.1200000000001s)]
*  about this a long time because I have always considered myself a Reagan Republican. I came [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1076.72s)]
*  up in the 80s and I believed in everything he stood for, and as I got older, I was a Constitutional [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1081.44s)]
*  law attorney. I really dug in on this stuff. I started studying the history of the conservative [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1085.84s)]
*  movement, and I'll tell you a quick story because it'll illustrate what I'm talking about. When I [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1090.48s)]
*  was a sophomore in Congress, my second term, I got elected chair of the Republican Study Committee, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1094.16s)]
*  largest caucus of conservatives in Congress. Actually, it's the largest caucus at the time. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1098.96s)]
*  We had 158 House Republicans. I should not have been elected to that. I didn't have the seniority, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1103.04s)]
*  but it was really more about skill set, whatever. I became the head of that party. I remember this [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1107.04s)]
*  is about, this is 2019. We're going through a sea change as a party. We're midway through the Trump [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1112.1599999999999s)]
*  administration. These debates and the things you just articulated are percolating up, and everybody's [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1117.36s)]
*  kind of talking about it in their own way. It felt like we were, in some ways, almost losing our [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1122.32s)]
*  identity as a party. What I tried to do is wrangle all that back together, harness the energy, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1126.96s)]
*  and not have us stray too far from our founding principles as a party. I tried to come up with a [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1133.52s)]
*  summary. I was traveling around the country doing campaign events, and I was talking to my colleagues, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1138.32s)]
*  and it occurred to me that many people who identified as conservatives were not able to [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1141.92s)]
*  articulate in a concise manner what that meant. I stood in front of all the RSC members after [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1146.0s)]
*  having been elected chair, and I said, y'all, we're kind of at an inflection point. What does it mean [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1150.08s)]
*  to be an American conservative? I posited to them this notion. I said, listen, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1156.0s)]
*  if I asked each of you, let's say you're in an elevator downtown here in Washington later this [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1161.84s)]
*  afternoon, and you get on an elevator, and you have a young progressive there, and you have just a [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1166.8799999999999s)]
*  couple of months, maybe three minutes, to talk with this person about their philosophy, and they [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1170.9599999999998s)]
*  tee you up for it. Why? Because they're wearing a t-shirt that says proud progressive. Okay, so [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1174.3999999999999s)]
*  you're in the elevator. How do you summarize for them what we believe? What do you believe? Why is [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1178.08s)]
*  it better for them? Why is there a deal? Well, I know how to do that if we're talking about Reagan [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1182.8799999999999s)]
*  era conservatism. Free people, free markets. Well, sort of, but it's more detailed than that. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1186.0s)]
*  I boiled it down to what I call the seven core principles, and it's individual freedom, limited [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1191.52s)]
*  government, the rule of law, peace through strength, fiscal responsibility, free markets, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1195.6s)]
*  and human dignity. Under each of those things are subcategories, but those are sort of the fixed [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1199.84s)]
*  points on the horizon. Those are the things that define us. I told my colleagues, I said, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1204.32s)]
*  if you had to condense all conservative thought, a library full of volumes of conservative, from [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1208.3999999999999s)]
*  Edmund Burke until today, I think that list pretty well crystallizes it. Okay, square that for me [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1213.12s)]
*  with Trump saying the most beautiful word in the English language is tariffs. Yeah, he told me that [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1218.72s)]
*  a couple days ago. So let's just hear more of this Trump person. No, no, I get in a lot of trouble [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1224.0s)]
*  for that. No, one big beautiful bill. That's what we're going to do. No, don't don't make me do it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1230.24s)]
*  More. No, no, no. You're better than Shane Gillis. Come on. Oh, yeah, I need a backup plan. I got to [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1236.24s)]
*  do SNL. Just talk to me about tariffs as Trump for 30 seconds. Okay, look, what we're doing right now [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1240.72s)]
*  is a fusion. It's a new fusion. Okay, we're taking, we're taking Reagan, classic Reaganism [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1247.2s)]
*  and fusing it with nationalist populism. Right. That don't work. Well, let's see if it works. Look, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1253.28s)]
*  what Trump did in 2015, 2016, is he recognized some blind spots in the party. So we started [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1259.2s)]
*  talking about things like the threat of China, right? It wasn't really big on the radar, not to [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1264.96s)]
*  the point it is now. He saw it first, tariffs, you know, trade policy, the American worker. And [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1268.88s)]
*  I think the party in some ways had lost focus of that. Now, Reagan did it so well because he [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1276.4s)]
*  brought all these people into the party in the early 80s, but, you know, we had mission drift [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1280.16s)]
*  in some way. So the, the populist aspect of this is a good sort of shot in the arm. I don't think [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1284.48s)]
*  we abandon who we are as a party. I don't think we ever can. I will be fighting for us not to [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1290.16s)]
*  abandon the core principles, but at the same time recognize, I mean, populism is defined different [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1294.8799999999999s)]
*  ways by different people, but at its essence, what I think we're getting at is what are the desires [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1299.52s)]
*  and needs of the people, the common sense needs that they have. Well, let's choose like maybe two, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1304.16s)]
*  two obvious, like pivot, points of tension is maybe an elegant way to say it. Yes. One is [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1308.0800000000002s)]
*  foreign policy. There is an enormous range right now, much more so I would argue than even the [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1315.76s)]
*  Democratic party among Republicans about what you just defined as peace through strength. There are [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1321.44s)]
*  people who really put the emphasis on the strength part of that and understand that strength comes, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1326.64s)]
*  sorry, peace comes through, you know, making your enemies fear you and being serious and [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1332.64s)]
*  following up with your threats. There are many other people in your party who really emphasize [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1338.24s)]
*  the peace part of it and are seen seem to sort of ignore how peace is guaranteed. Where do you fall [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1342.8000000000002s)]
*  in that debate? I think I fall where Reagan did, but with this caveat, like I have a lot of colleagues, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1349.76s)]
*  they're defined, some of them are defined as isolationists, but they're not, they're [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1357.68s)]
*  anti-interventionalists, right? So there's a sliding scale here. They're not saying it [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1361.36s)]
*  should be America only. When they say America first, what they mean is we take care of our [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1367.04s)]
*  own house before we take care of the neighborhood. It's just really, again, a return to common sense. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1371.84s)]
*  At the same time, we have the biggest, most powerful house in the neighborhood and we have [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1376.0s)]
*  to maintain that perception because that's what keeps peace in the neighborhood. So you have to [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1380.0s)]
*  have an adequately funded and prepared defense. We've strayed away from that in the last few [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1384.6399999999999s)]
*  years. Pete Hegseth is one of the, you know, the reason he's a nominee, unconventional as he is, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1388.96s)]
*  is because he understands that we have to have the strongest military in the world. A strong America [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1393.68s)]
*  is good for everybody around the globe. One thing I've learned, Barry, over the last, you know, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1399.6000000000001s)]
*  15, 16 months since I've been speaker, the only international trip I had time to take as speaker, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1403.92s)]
*  because I was a wartime speaker for the last, you know, into the last Congress, is I went to [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1408.72s)]
*  Italy for the G7 speakers meeting and I had to go because it's a G7. And I met there with my [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1413.36s)]
*  counterparts who are the leaders of the great, you know, free parliaments around the world and [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1419.4399999999998s)]
*  then others, the other countries who are invited and all of them. I just, I recognized, I've always [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  understood the importance of America on the world stage, but it was never so, it never resonated with [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1430.0s)]
*  me as it did when I walked into that room because when America walks, it's not me, it's who I [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1435.04s)]
*  represent in that setting. And you walk in and people go, it's almost like the Lion King, like, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1440.4s)]
*  oh, you know, it's America. That's what we have to do. And you're Mufasa. I am not Mufasa in this [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1443.8400000000001s)]
*  metaphor. I'm more like the cub, I think. But anyway, but I represent, I represent the great [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1449.1200000000001s)]
*  power and we have had that stature since World War II. Reagan used to say so eloquently, he said, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1455.52s)]
*  the leadership of the free world was hoisted, placed upon the shoulders of America after World [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1460.96s)]
*  War II. And I think it was Pope Pius XII who articulated this so well. We have a responsibility [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1464.48s)]
*  it does not mean that we need to be nation builders and interventionists and have boots on the ground. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1470.32s)]
*  But speaker, even that notion of the free world, the idea that Ukraine is sort of at the front lines [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1474.1599999999999s)]
*  of the free world, the idea that the Israelis that are fighting terrorists in southern Lebanon and [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1480.3999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza are at the front line of the free world. There are people in your caucus who don't believe [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1485.12s)]
*  in that notion. They don't believe in the connectivity of those things fundamentally. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1489.12s)]
*  Yes, but Israel, for example, because this is a loud fire exercise. Right now, we were talking [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1494.48s)]
*  about this morning. I talked to Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday. He called me to give me an [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1498.16s)]
*  update and I wanted to encourage him. You know, they're having a struggle right now whether you [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1502.4s)]
*  just take out the threat of Hamas or whether they acquiesce and do this peace deal. Hamas or Iran? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1507.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe both. I mean, we have to see. His position right now, I'm not saying anything that's [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1513.52s)]
*  classified, this is public, but they believe they got to eradicate that threat and they need America, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1518.96s)]
*  sort of the big brother in this scenario, standing over their shoulder to ensure that they can. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1524.56s)]
*  Israel wants to do it. They will do it on their own. That's the kind of activity we want to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1529.36s)]
*  encourage, but they have to know that we will stand resolutely with them. See, Hamas had calculated [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1533.6799999999998s)]
*  that the American and Israeli relationship was being weakened because Biden and Blinken and the [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1538.8s)]
*  team were equivocating. We all do that. We have a new sheriff in town. When the president stood at [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1543.44s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago a week ago and said, there'll be hell to pay if you don't get those sausages back, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1547.9199999999998s)]
*  that's the kind of thing that we need. It does not mean we're sending American troops to go be [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1552.72s)]
*  boots on the ground of the conflict, but the presence, the perception, the power of America [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1556.4s)]
*  being projected in that way is critical, not only for our role to maintain our status as the [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1561.2s)]
*  last great superpower and keep our edge over China and other competitors, but because it [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1566.96s)]
*  sort of broadcast peace around the globe. That understanding, you've seen all the world leaders [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1572.56s)]
*  making their pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago over the last couple of months since the election. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1577.28s)]
*  You know, they understand the necessity of us being in this strong position and what that means [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1580.8799999999999s)]
*  for all of them and their own countries around the globe. That's a really important role that [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1585.36s)]
*  we cannot ever surrender because the consequences of it are too great. Is this deal Trump's or [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1588.8799999999999s)]
*  Biden's? Oh, it's Trump's. I mean, look, they wouldn't even be having the conversation. It [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1594.8s)]
*  wouldn't come to that inflection point without his making the open threat like that. There are [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1599.04s)]
*  people that are resigning on the right from, you know, the Israeli Knesset like Ben Gavir and I [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1603.1999999999998s)]
*  think Schmutzschuk because they feel like this is breaking the fundamental covenant. In other words, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1608.24s)]
*  there's a core tension in this war. Bring all the hostages home and defeat Hamas forever. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1614.48s)]
*  Those things were never reconcilable. And their argument is, you know, Yaya Sienwar, who was [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1619.68s)]
*  freed with the Gilad Shalit deal, then becomes the mastermind. Who are the terrorists that are [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1626.08s)]
*  going to be released now and commit the next October 7th? What do you make of that argument? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1630.64s)]
*  Israel is very concerned about that. The leadership is very concerned and so are we. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1635.2s)]
*  And the terms of that deal is something they've got to negotiate and be comfortable with. We [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1638.56s)]
*  should not be intervening in that. I don't think it's our place. But as I told the Prime Minister [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1642.32s)]
*  yesterday, I said, you know, the Speaker of the House stands with you. We will stand resolute with [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1648.72s)]
*  you. And I believe that is going to be President Trump's first admonition and his commitment when [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1652.72s)]
*  he comes in. He understands our role in the world and he wouldn't be out using that strong [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1660.32s)]
*  language like there'll be hell to pay if he was not willing to back it up. And that's really [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1665.28s)]
*  important for us to project. One more question on the deal. Help square for me the fact that Qatar [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1669.2s)]
*  is the country that shields the leaders of Hamas, one of whom just came out with a video saying, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1674.32s)]
*  you know, victory. And by the way, there's going to be another October 7th. Why would we [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1680.8799999999999s)]
*  trust Qatar to do that? Why are we so comfortable with the relationship that many in D.C. seem to [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1685.68s)]
*  have with a country that actively harbors terrorists? Like explain that to me. I wish I could. I have the [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1691.68s)]
*  same concern in question and we have to walk very circumspectly in these places. You see, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1697.8400000000001s)]
*  you want to believe the best about these other countries in that region and that they're doing [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1703.44s)]
*  it in good faith and for the right reason. And restoring peace to that region should be good for [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1707.5200000000002s)]
*  it is good for everyone. They should recognize it. But as Ronald Reagan said, you know, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1712.32s)]
*  trust but verify or maybe we don't even need to verify. They're literally putting the leaders of [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1716.8s)]
*  Hamas on television. Yeah, we maybe we distrust and verify at the same time. I have real concern [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1721.92s)]
*  about it as you do and I don't have the answer, but it's something we've got to we've got to divine. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1727.36s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about Biden for a second. Yeah, you have said that he is the worst. I actually want [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1731.2s)]
*  to quote this. Make sure I get it right. You have said that he is the worst president in the history [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1739.12s)]
*  of this country. Worse even than James Buchanan? I mean, I didn't say that. Yes, you did. I didn't [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1744.3999999999999s)]
*  say James Buchanan. No, you didn't say James Buchanan. You said Biden is the worst president [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1751.1999999999998s)]
*  in the history of the country. All right. With him about to leave office. Yes. Do you want to [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1756.0s)]
*  revise that or do you still stand by it? No, no, I do stand by it and I say this without any personal [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1759.84s)]
*  animus at all. I mean, I, you know, in some ways, I actually kind of feel sorry for Joe Biden. I mean, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1764.4799999999998s)]
*  he's in the twilight years of his life. He is not obviously has not been in charge for some time and [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1768.64s)]
*  I know this by personal observation and now the whole world knows it and it's been very, very [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1774.72s)]
*  concerning to me over the last, you know, year and a half since I've had this position. Can you tell us a story when [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1778.72s)]
*  you say personal observation? What kind of thing did you see? Well, I mean, this is it's public now because the [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1783.2s)]
*  Wall Street Journal got it and put it on the front page, but January a year ago, almost exactly a year ago, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1787.5200000000002s)]
*  I had been asked, I became speaker in October 2023 and there were all sorts of big national security [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1793.92s)]
*  concerns and everything going on and I started requesting a meeting with the president because, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1799.28s)]
*  you know, I'm kind of old school. I'm a constitutional law guy. Speaker of the house should be able to [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1803.1200000000001s)]
*  talk to the president, especially in times of great national interest and calamity, but they [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1806.56s)]
*  wouldn't let me meet with him and his staff kept putting, giving him excuses. This went on for like [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1811.44s)]
*  eight or nine weeks. I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker, he doesn't have time. What are you talking about? I'm second [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1814.96s)]
*  line of the presidency. He has time. I need to talk to him. We had, I can't say the classified parts, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1818.8s)]
*  but we had some big, big national concerns at the time that I was losing sleep over. Finally, I just [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1823.44s)]
*  went to the Hill Press Corps and I said, the president is not being allowed to meet with the [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1829.68s)]
*  speaker. There's a problem. So they started putting pressure on them. Long story short, they finally [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1832.3999999999999s)]
*  relented. They invited me to the White House. I show up and I realized it's actually an ambush [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1836.8s)]
*  because it's not just me and the president. It's also Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem, you know, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1840.32s)]
*  the whole CIA director, everybody. And then so I walked in the Oval and I know what this is. This [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1846.0s)]
*  is a, they're going to hot box the speaker on Ukraine funding. That's what it was. This is probably [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1851.44s)]
*  third week of January. We sit down, we're in the midst of it and the whole conversation and I'm [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1856.32s)]
*  going, we don't need to have this conversation. The president reaches over just like this. We're [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1861.2s)]
*  sitting in the right next to the fireplace in the Oval and he grabs my arm and he says, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1864.48s)]
*  the speaker and I just need a couple minutes together. Would y'all just leave us alone? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1868.32s)]
*  And I looked up on the faces of some of the staff standing around the wall and they're like, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1871.52s)]
*  no, he did it. So they, he called it. He's the commander in chief. So everybody leaves and he [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  and I are standing awkwardly in the middle of the Oval office right over the rug by that coffee table. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1878.48s)]
*  And I said, Mr. President, thanks for the moments. You know, this is very important. I got some big [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1883.04s)]
*  national security things I need to talk to you about that I've heard and I think you know, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1887.1200000000001s)]
*  and what do we do? And, but first real quickly, Mr. President, can I ask you a question? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1890.32s)]
*  I cannot answer this to, from my constituents in Louisiana, sir, why did you pause LNG exports to [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1894.48s)]
*  Europe? Like, I don't understand, you know, liquefied natural gas is in great demand by our [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1901.2s)]
*  allies. Why would you do that? Because you understand, we just talked about Ukraine. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1905.44s)]
*  You understand you're fueling Vladimir Putin's war machine because they got to get their gas from [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1908.88s)]
*  him, you know. And he looks at me stunned with this and he said, I didn't do that. And I said, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1912.64s)]
*  Mr. President, yes, you did. It was an executive order like, you know, three weeks ago. And he [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1919.04s)]
*  goes, no, I didn't do that. And he's arguing with me. I said, Mr. President, respectfully, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1922.88s)]
*  can I, could I go out here and ask your secretary to print it out? We'll read it together. You [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1926.8s)]
*  definitely did that. And he goes, oh, you talk about natural gas. Yes, sir. He said, no, no, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1930.56s)]
*  I didn't, you misunderstand. He said, what I did is I signed this thing to, we're going to, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1936.0s)]
*  we're going to conduct a study on the effects of LNG. I said, no, you're not, sir. You paused it. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1939.6s)]
*  I know I have the terminal, the export terminals in my state. I talked to those people this morning. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1945.12s)]
*  You're, this is doing massive damage to our economy, national security. It occurred to me, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1949.9199999999998s)]
*  Barry, he was not lying to me. He genuinely did not know what he had signed. And I walked out of [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1954.24s)]
*  that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought we're in serious trouble. Who is running [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1959.04s)]
*  the country? Like, I don't know who put the paper in front of him, but he didn't know. All right. So [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1963.6s)]
*  like, who has been the president for the past year and a half? I wish I could tell you, I get asked [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1967.52s)]
*  this because my wife thinks it's Dr. Jill. It was only referred to in our house as Dr. Jill. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1973.36s)]
*  She certainly had a lot of influence, but I think it is a group of people. This is the way I reason [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1978.72s)]
*  this. When he was on the stage and he had whatever, 15 or 16 different Democrats on the first debate [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1985.04s)]
*  and they were trying to get the nomination when he ran, they were dropped off one by one and they [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1989.6s)]
*  settled on Joe because they thought he'd be the most electable because some of them were too far [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=1996.24s)]
*  left. Well, each of them, I think, sat down with him as a condition of dropping out and Elizabeth [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2000.48s)]
*  Warren and Bernie and the rest and said, fine, but you're going to take my person to run this and [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2004.8s)]
*  you're going to take this person and here's my list of demands. And he just agreed to all of it [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2009.2s)]
*  because he wanted to be president so badly. So over the next four years, they made good on those [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2012.48s)]
*  commitments and he brought in people and assigned things incringruous as they were, as dangerous as [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2016.88s)]
*  they were, kind of productive. He just fulfilled the commitments and he had people around him doing [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2021.04s)]
*  it and it led us into absolute chaos and every metric of public policy is a disaster and that's [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2025.04s)]
*  why I think that's, that is not an uncharitable description. It is objective fact. I think, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2031.2s)]
*  I think when it's measured, his public opinion polls, the lowest ever, when it's measured, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2035.76s)]
*  I think the results are going to be that he was the worst president, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2040.32s)]
*  certainly in the modern era, maybe in the whole country, in the whole history of the country. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2043.84s)]
*  Just let's stay on this for one beat, the cover up, okay, if we can call it that, of his mental [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2048.24s)]
*  capabilities. I was at a dinner with a lot of prominent Democratic donors and there was a, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2054.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm sure you've been at many dinners like this from, with Republicans where someone says something [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2062.3199999999997s)]
*  and everyone just kind of repeats it and repeats and repeats and everyone's in agreement and they're [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2067.36s)]
*  so happy and the consensus that night was Joe Biden's amazing. Joe Biden is fully [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2070.7200000000003s)]
*  compas mentis. He can do anything, incredible president, incredible strength and one of them [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2075.6800000000003s)]
*  sits down after and we're kind of having a private conversation. I'm like level with me here, like [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2079.84s)]
*  what's, what do you actually think and the things that came out of this person's mouth to me in [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2085.76s)]
*  private were the exact opposite of the things they had just proclaimed in front of many of their [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2090.6400000000003s)]
*  friends at this dinner party. Like I guess the phrase is preference falsification, right? The [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2095.36s)]
*  cascade begins when someone tells their private truth out loud and sort of dispels the public lie. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2102.08s)]
*  How much of an effect do you think that that had on the election? Like the sense that people had [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2108.6400000000003s)]
*  that they were being lied to. About everything, about everything. The economy's great, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2114.6400000000003s)]
*  Bidenomics is awesome, your family's doing great. I mean you know, woatness is the new way of the [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2119.84s)]
*  future and you should buy, you know, all of it. Everything they did was just, they were defying [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  common sense, they were trying to defy gravity, they ignored the people's real sentiments. No one [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2129.6000000000004s)]
*  liked any of that stuff and they got fed up with it. I mean in layman's terms that's what happened, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2135.36s)]
*  that's what the election was about. It was a full repudiation of that nonsense and that's what it [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2140.0s)]
*  was and when President Trump says we're going to restore common sense, people stand up and cheer [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2144.48s)]
*  because that's a low bar but that's where we are. We've got to get back to just reason and thought [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2148.32s)]
*  and not group think and they did that to their detriment. I think the Democratic Party, they're [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2153.1200000000003s)]
*  doing the autopsy now and they recognize they went too far. They're in a real problem because they [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2158.32s)]
*  don't have a identified leader of the party, they don't have a real vision right now. They're going [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2163.36s)]
*  to have to do a whole cloth rewrite of their platform and it gives us a great opportunity to [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2167.44s)]
*  demonstrate common sense and that our principles, those core principles I articulated and the things [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2172.0800000000004s)]
*  that fall under those subcategories is what is going to lead us back. The things that made us the [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2176.96s)]
*  greatest nation in the history of the world are the things that will make us great again and we [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2181.52s)]
*  don't need to reinvent the wheel here. Do you think there's something so bleak about the phrase [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2185.2s)]
*  make America great again? Actually it's a Reagan phrase, I mean he said it. I know but the assumption [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2188.96s)]
*  is that it's not great. Oh that's nonsense. I'm an exceptionalism guy. I believe it is. But if we [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2193.68s)]
*  have to make something great again it means it's not great. Well look there's no question that we've [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2199.44s)]
*  been tarnished. I mean the shine has come off. We're not the shining city on a hill right now. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2204.32s)]
*  We're divided. We've gone through a valley, a dark valley, but the beauty of America is [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2208.7200000000003s)]
*  I think we are going to have a new morning in America because we can always return to those [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2214.0s)]
*  principles and we do need to return. We have strayed away and tried to become something that we're [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2218.0800000000004s)]
*  not. America is the greatest nation in the history of the world. It's not even subject to [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2222.48s)]
*  radical debate, I mean rational debate. Look we're the strongest, the freest, the most powerful, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2228.2400000000002s)]
*  most successful, most benevolent nation that's ever been and there's a reason for that. And I [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2232.72s)]
*  would add most progressive. I agree with that but if you wind back the clock eight years ago, 2016, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2237.2799999999997s)]
*  this very weekend, Donald Trump gets up and delivers one of the bleakest speeches I've ever [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2243.52s)]
*  heard an American political leader give, the American carnage speech. What do we get? What [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2248.24s)]
*  do you think we're going to hear from him when he gets up on stage whether it's indoors or outdoors? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2253.9199999999996s)]
*  Well it's going to be indoors now thankfully because I'm from Louisiana. Are you freezing? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2257.2s)]
*  Oh I was going to layer up. I mean we had the heat warmers. We don't need any of that now. I'm [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2261.52s)]
*  grateful. I thought they were doing it for the gerontocracy like the older senators literally [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2265.44s)]
*  cannot be outside in those temperatures. No kidding. I just left my office. Ted Cruz and [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2269.84s)]
*  Lindsey Graham were in my office and we were talking about old senators who couldn't stand [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2273.52s)]
*  the cold. Did I just say that on camera? I'm sorry. No it's going to be fine but look his tone. But [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2277.28s)]
*  you remember that speech. I do and I think what he was trying to do it was intended to be jarring. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2283.84s)]
*  He was definitely jarring. Well it was. He had to shake everybody out of the malaise. It's not [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2289.68s)]
*  some of the language. You know it wasn't a Reagan speech right but it took that. He needs Peggy [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2293.8399999999997s)]
*  Noonan. Let's be real. Yeah yeah. I love her. She was a great speechwriter and she's still great. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2299.12s)]
*  It was like pumping the heart back into action right. Like it was jarring. It got everybody's [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2304.64s)]
*  attention and then it set us back on the course to do what we're doing now and now his language [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2310.3199999999997s)]
*  is much more lofty and optimistic. He's talking about a new golden age in America and that's not [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2314.72s)]
*  campaign rhetoric. We can actually do that because we know how and if we have unified government and [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2320.96s)]
*  if we can keep the republicans rowing in the same direction that's what we'll do and it will be good [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2325.44s)]
*  for everybody no matter their party or ideology. I think one of the great paradoxes of American [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2329.68s)]
*  life right now. I'm sure you saw yesterday there was another heavy booster rocket that SpaceX sent [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2335.3599999999997s)]
*  into space and got caught by these I guess what you could only describe as chopstick arms. Like [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2340.24s)]
*  we live in a country where that is possible. You know and I know Blue Origin, the new Glenn made it [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2344.9599999999996s)]
*  so it was like an incredible week for space and yet you look at California and entire neighborhoods [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2350.0s)]
*  are being burned to the ground right now. There was not water in some of the hydrants or in one [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2357.2799999999997s)]
*  of the key reservoirs. Explain this to me. Case in point. But is that just government like is that [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2362.08s)]
*  just the nature of bureaucracy versus private enterprise or is that just a really really poor [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2367.36s)]
*  lawmakers in that particular state? It's both. I mean it's an illustration. Elon is the private [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2374.08s)]
*  sector, their free market unleashed. You know a great entrepreneurial spirit and great creativity [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2378.48s)]
*  and everything that's allowed in the private sector unencumbered by government regulation even [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2384.48s)]
*  though they are having the regulator we can remove some of that red tape and make it even better. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2388.48s)]
*  That's the hope. That's why he's so deeply invested. But then here's government in California. I mean [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2392.0s)]
*  illustration A. I mean it's government on steroids, radical progressivism. I mean they're doing [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2397.76s)]
*  everything that defies common sense and there are real consequences of that. It was so phenomenal to [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2402.2400000000002s)]
*  me. The LA Times last week retracted their endorsement for Mayor Karen Bass and said oh gee. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2406.6400000000003s)]
*  That guy's pivot makes Mark Zuckerberg look like a tortoise. Like I'm getting whiplash. Like all of [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2412.48s)]
*  a sudden the LA Times which is being run by his literally communist daughter is now he's all of a [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2418.7200000000003s)]
*  sudden like Team Maha. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. The recognition of gosh competence [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2425.36s)]
*  may actually matter in a mayor's race. Oh wow in a governor's race and they're talking about recalling [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2430.96s)]
*  the mayor and the governor. You know look they need to. But how do we get the heavy booster [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2435.76s)]
*  chopstick arms vibes into government? Like anyone that's been to the DMV wants to kill themselves. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2439.6s)]
*  We're working on it. Elon and I were flying. It sounds like an opening of a bar joke but [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2445.04s)]
*  flying back from the UFC fight at 3 a.m. back to Milwau. Eating McDonald's? Yes. R.F.K. was [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2449.2000000000003s)]
*  eating. He really did eat it. Oh that was the famous picture? Yeah. I feel like you guys forced [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2455.2s)]
*  him to do that. That was like some hazing ritual. On his own volition. Enjoyed it. Really? Wow. Big Mac or? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2460.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh the whole thing because when you're on Trump Force One which is the finest plane in the world [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2466.72s)]
*  everybody's saying it's the finest plane. When you're on there you get you don't like get [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2471.12s)]
*  give an order. You are served and you get I guess it's quarter pound cheese or big mac with cheese. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2477.3599999999997s)]
*  You get fries and the nuggets and a big giant diet coke. Wow. It's fantastic. Wow. Yeah I know. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2482.64s)]
*  And on the finest plane in the world. And so we're sitting there in this surreal moment. We had been [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2490.64s)]
*  at UFC. You know I'm hanging out ringside with you know Kid Rock and Jelly Roll and all that. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2495.92s)]
*  And I mean it was so it was so fun. But we so we're flying back. It's like three o'clock in [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2500.16s)]
*  them. We did a round trip from Mar-a-Lago to the UFC. We landed back in Palm Beach at like 4 25 a.m. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2504.4s)]
*  or something. But anyway it's the middle of night. Everybody's up like it's afternoon. You know we're [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2510.4s)]
*  just it's so much fun. Anyway I'm sitting in the plane talking to Elon about that question. How do [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2514.0s)]
*  we integrate all this great thing in government? And we're talking about Doge and you know the [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2519.28s)]
*  incredible potential and possibility that's there. And he's applying his like unique physics [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2524.08s)]
*  analytical mind to like government. And it's a totally new paradigm for him and for all of us. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2529.76s)]
*  One of the challenges we have right now is to answer that question. To marry all these things [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2536.48s)]
*  together. To leverage the Doge insights and he and Vivek and everybody who's working on that. And [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2541.36s)]
*  he's by the way he's asked for resumes for people who want to work for this non-governmental agency [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2546.72s)]
*  that's going to inform a lot of what we do. As we're trying to downsize the size and scope of [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2551.04s)]
*  government it's good to have fresh eyes on that and to have private sector individuals look at this [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2556.0s)]
*  like a business. That's one of the appeals of Donald Trump. Why people voted for him. He thinks [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2560.88s)]
*  of government with the mind of a businessman instead of a politician. And that's great. That's [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2565.6800000000003s)]
*  what the country needs. What's your impression of Elon Musk and do you think that the bromance [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2570.88s)]
*  between these two alphas, these two arguably strongest men in the world is destined for a [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2575.52s)]
*  blow-off? And when do you think that's going to happen? I love it. I have some epic selfies of [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2581.2000000000003s)]
*  the three of us like hanging out on the plane you know. I really enjoy getting to know Elon. He's a [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2584.4s)]
*  fascinating guy and he's humble enough to know that while he's an expert in like things I can't [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2589.68s)]
*  even begin to fathom, he doesn't know a lot about government. It's just not his thing. He's never [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2596.24s)]
*  been into it but he's one of the smartest guys on the planet obviously and he can learn it quickly. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2601.44s)]
*  So we've been talking about that. I've been on the phone with him talking about the [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2604.7999999999997s)]
*  legislation and the components that go into it and why it's so important and all that. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2609.44s)]
*  I've really enjoyed that relationship and he's just a unique figure. I mean he's just [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2613.2s)]
*  brilliant obviously and he can do things that we couldn't have imagined. You know, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2618.08s)]
*  catching a rocket with chopsticks as you said and so much more that we're capable of that will help [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2622.8s)]
*  us in the defense space and everything else. And to have that integrated in some way in the new [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2627.44s)]
*  administration is part of the magic of it and now how it works, it's a blank canvas on which we are [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2633.6000000000004s)]
*  painting now and we're trying to figure out how all that works together but you've got two [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2640.0s)]
*  entrepreneurial spirits there at the top, those two, that are thinking about that in very creative [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2643.76s)]
*  ways and we're going to try to pull it all together and I think we can. One of the early blowups [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2648.2400000000002s)]
*  between the musketeers and the Bannonites was over this H-1B visa issue, high-skilled immigration. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2653.1200000000003s)]
*  Where did you fall on that debate? I came off the Judiciary Committee where immigration was in our [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2659.36s)]
*  jurisdiction and we wrestled over that because they're both right. They're both right in certain [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2665.28s)]
*  respects. It's one of the hardest things. Comprehensive immigration reform is so complicated and we spent, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2671.44s)]
*  my sophomore term in Congress, we spent almost a year and a half trying to forge a consensus on how [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2678.56s)]
*  to fix the mess because we had a border problem then. We had, you know, we were trying to build [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2684.2400000000002s)]
*  the wall and do all these other things and it was bipartisan. We had long discussions and, you know, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2688.2400000000002s)]
*  listening sessions and whiteboard exercises in the basements of the Capitol. Nine or ten months into [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2694.48s)]
*  it we produced, remember the Goodlatte 1 versus Goodlatte 2 drama? We had two competing bills and [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2699.6s)]
*  the president said, I kind of like both of them. This is really a DC drama. Oh man, it was, I'm [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2704.56s)]
*  right a volume about that one too, but ultimately both bills failed because we couldn't get everybody [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2708.56s)]
*  together on those issues. But don't you think there's actually a core philosophical disagreement [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2714.96s)]
*  that can't be squared? Here's what I mean. It's a question of what leads to the most human flourishing [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2719.2s)]
*  for Americans. On the one side of the argument is the perspective that let the free market do [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2724.4s)]
*  its thing. If we let Elon Musk or Metta or whoever, any of these companies, work with whoever is the [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2729.92s)]
*  best and most efficient, economically speaking, talent, that will ultimately lead to the best for [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2737.2000000000003s)]
*  everybody. And then there's this other view, this sort of nationalist populist view that, you know, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2743.6s)]
*  is very compelling to a lot of people which says, no, we have to look out for our own people first, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2748.48s)]
*  even if it means retraining people in slightly less efficiency for these companies. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2754.08s)]
*  Like that is a, I don't see those as being harmonious. You kind of have to pick one. Well, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2759.2s)]
*  they're not harmonious as described, but we're in the process of fusionism. The conservative [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2764.24s)]
*  movement went through a fusionist sort of era, you know, a few decades ago. We're doing it again. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2769.36s)]
*  What was the one then and what is the one now? Well, you had different, you had like the sort [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2775.12s)]
*  of the John Birch Society, you know, almost libertarian sort of wing, and you had the [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2779.44s)]
*  three legs of the stool of the Reagan era, remember the, you know, bringing all those people together. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2785.28s)]
*  National Review used to have a long series on how we're going to merge all this together. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2791.6s)]
*  It's a fascinating history of the movement. Matthew Contenetti wrote a book recently, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2795.2000000000003s)]
*  The Right. Yeah, it's phenomenal. Yeah, and he chronicled a lot of that, but there are others [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2799.92s)]
*  who have. But putting all that together is how we forge the consensus. We have new demographics in [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2803.52s)]
*  the party. We have new folks there. They're bringing all these new perspectives in, and we've got to [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2809.7599999999998s)]
*  gear this again, holding fast to the core principles, not losing it, because that's what anchors us, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2814.56s)]
*  but then also sort of appealing to and hearing from the American worker that the nationalist, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2820.32s)]
*  the nationalism, it comes from an honest place. They want to take care of their own house first, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2827.6s)]
*  and I think that is common sense. I think it makes sense, but it doesn't mean that you can turn your [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2832.56s)]
*  back on everything else happening, and how we marry all that together is the question of the day, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2837.36s)]
*  and I think that the weeks and months ahead are going to be instructive on that. So no clear [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2842.56s)]
*  answer on Team Musk or Team Bannon. Oh, I love them both. I got to love, I have to love everybody. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2846.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. You're so, okay. Yes, yes, yes. California fires are obviously in the news. You made a lot [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2851.52s)]
*  of headlines when you talked about putting conditions on wildfire aid to California. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2857.76s)]
*  Do you stand by that? Yeah, you can call it conditions or safeguards or accountability. We [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2864.0s)]
*  owe that to the American taxpayer. We're in dire fiscal straits right now with $36 trillion in [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2870.0s)]
*  federal debt, and they're saying this disaster may be $150 billion or more, right? But why? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2874.8s)]
*  Why is that? I think if there's culpability, there ought to be conditions. What do I mean by that? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2881.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, they're natural disasters. I live in a disaster-prone state of Louisiana. Gavin Newsom [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2885.52s)]
*  tried to call me out on social media 48 hours ago, and I hit back and said, go tend to the fires, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2889.2s)]
*  dude. Get off social media, right? Like, all I was saying is common sense. Again, taxpayers around [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2893.2s)]
*  the country should not be funding crazy leftist policy choices that exacerbated the effects of a [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2899.6s)]
*  national natural disaster. We understand there are people in terrible situations there. We got to take [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2905.6s)]
*  care of American people, but when they made decisions to not have the reservoirs filled, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2910.48s)]
*  to not have hydrants at work, to go to DEI and the fire service and not have capable persons at [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2914.48s)]
*  the helm to decide that you're going to protect the smelt fish instead of the taxpayer. I mean, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2919.36s)]
*  it made it, it set the conditions to make it much worse. Somebody sent me a video. It was produced [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2925.6s)]
*  in 1962, one of those old school documentaries that chronicled exactly what we just saw happen in [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2930.64s)]
*  2020-25. They had a, they chronicled this big fire that happened in almost that same area in [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2937.6s)]
*  California because of the Santa Ana winds, and they said these are policy prescriptions that will [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2943.7599999999998s)]
*  prevent it from happening again. They defied it. But if the Red River overflowed and Speaker Hakeem [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2947.6s)]
*  Jeffries said, we're going to put some conditions on that. If the Red River overflowed because I [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2953.8399999999997s)]
*  was down there with dynamite blowing up the levees, then Hakeem would have a great point. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2959.44s)]
*  That's the effect. That's what we're talking about in California. They almost literally did that, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2962.96s)]
*  and they set up the conditions for this calamity. So we're going to take care, look, the Congress is [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2966.88s)]
*  going to take care of its obligations. There is a federal role in things like this, but it would be [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2972.32s)]
*  foolish to say that we're going to send blank checks to Gavin Newsom so they can squander it [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2976.96s)]
*  and continue their crazy policies. This is not unprecedented. After Katrina in my state, when we [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2980.8s)]
*  did have floods in the Mississippi and all the rest, there were conditions placed on the money [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2985.6s)]
*  that came. You had to build up higher. If you're at low elevations, you got to put it on stilts, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2991.2000000000003s)]
*  all those things. And everybody thought that was reasonable after Hurricane Sandy for the Northeast. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2995.28s)]
*  Same thing. So we're not talking about some new concept here, and it's not a slight to the people [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=2999.2000000000003s)]
*  of California. It is an admonition to the leadership or the lack of leadership in California, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3003.84s)]
*  and I think we have an obligation to do that. January 6, 2021 was obviously a very bad day [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3010.0s)]
*  in American history. Ashley Babbitt killed by a cop. Cops were beaten by rioters. The Capitol was [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3015.36s)]
*  trashed. You had the guy in the Camp Auschwitz shirt. You've been asked zillions of questions [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3020.0s)]
*  about this. I don't want to rehash them. People can look to your record. You voted to overturn [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3024.0s)]
*  the results of the 2020 election. No, no, I didn't. Okay. How would you describe it? How much time do [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3028.24s)]
*  we have? How much time do we have? So quick summary. I wrote the famous, infamous brief to [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3033.28s)]
*  the Supreme Court to point out the very obvious fact that in the 2020 election, we had unprecedented [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3040.8s)]
*  irregularity and we had unconstitutionality. Why is that? Because it was COVID and sometimes in good [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3046.72s)]
*  faith, sometimes in bad faith, all the different states started adjusting their election laws. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3054.48s)]
*  You had governors, election commissioners, sometimes state district court judges. They changed all the [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3059.04s)]
*  rules. Hey, let's send paper ballots to everybody. Let's do that. Let's do this. Let's put unmanned, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3062.9599999999996s)]
*  you know, ballot boxes in public parks for six weeks, all this crazy stuff. Well, here's the [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3067.8399999999997s)]
*  problem. Basically, they changed the rules. They changed the rules and it was not constitutional. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3071.52s)]
*  Why? Because it was not ratified by the state legislatures, which is specifically articulated, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3075.84s)]
*  very black letter, plain language in the constitution. Only the state legislatures [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3081.1200000000003s)]
*  can choose the manner by which electors are chosen for a presidential election. And when the [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3085.84s)]
*  legislatures did not ratify all these crazy changes, it led to the chaos. It led to the questions, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3089.76s)]
*  the lack of faith in our institutions, and it violated the constitution. So we pointed that out [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3094.56s)]
*  plainly. Like I pointed it out in a brief to the court, very simple. I'm a constitutional attorney. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3099.2000000000003s)]
*  I used to litigate cases like this. It's one of the shortest briefs I've ever written. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3104.0s)]
*  Very clear legal question. Did they ratify it with the legislatures or not? Here's what the [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3107.92s)]
*  constitution says. Here's what didn't happen. What do we do with that? The Supreme Court potted. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3112.72s)]
*  They said there was no standing. It was the Georgia versus Texas thing. So the question was [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3118.0s)]
*  never answered, but no one can answer that question. Okay. Well, let me put it to you this way. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3121.84s)]
*  There's sort of two views in parts of the right. There's the kind of hardcore, excuse me, stolen [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3125.36s)]
*  election view, which has to do with Dominion and China. And we don't even need to get into the [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3131.84s)]
*  fever swamps of it. But then there's the sort of softer view, which is the election wasn't stolen [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3136.32s)]
*  in the sense that like China was controlling the ballots, but it was stolen in the sense that [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3141.76s)]
*  Democrats took advantage of COVID to change the rules. Of course. Do you believe that version of [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3147.1200000000003s)]
*  things? I mean, look at Georgia. They sent paper ballots to everybody. And some of these states, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  they sent paper ballots and there was no way as soon as it was received back in the mail, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3156.56s)]
*  once you separated the ballot from the envelope, you couldn't even identify who submitted it. They [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3161.52s)]
*  did. They changed the laws in many jurisdictions in ways they were untraceable. There was, it would [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3165.28s)]
*  be impossible to prove if there was fraud. That's what diminished the people's faith in the election [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3169.92s)]
*  system itself. And that is a great threat to a constitutional Republic. Right. We rely on trust. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3175.12s)]
*  Yes. And the idea that people trust the outcomes of the elections. Let's say you walk out of here [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3180.8s)]
*  and someone comes up to you and says, I don't believe that the 2020 election was fair. And also [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3185.28s)]
*  I don't believe anymore in the outcomes of elections after that. What do you say to that [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3191.68s)]
*  person? Well, I had to answer that question on the campaign trailer over the last year, all around [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3195.4399999999996s)]
*  the country. And a huge number of people do not believe we have free and fair elections. Yes. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3199.04s)]
*  Well, this is what I told them. And I meant it in the depths of my soul. It's not a talking point. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3203.7599999999998s)]
*  There was unprecedented irregularity and problem in a 2020 election, but I want to tell you that [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3208.96s)]
*  that's never going to happen again. I said this on the campaign trail because look, everybody [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3215.04s)]
*  recognized that problem. And in early 2021 and in the months and days after all the, all the red [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3218.8s)]
*  state legislators, almost all of them got deeply involved. Over 400 pieces of legislation were [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3224.32s)]
*  filed or were passed through the legislature signed into law by the governors to clean up their [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3228.6400000000003s)]
*  systems and make sure that all the unprecedented irregularity of 2020 was never repeated again. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3232.4s)]
*  We have election security measures going on around the country. We passed the save act in [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3237.92s)]
*  the last Congress to try to make sure that illegal aliens cannot vote in elections. That's also [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3241.52s)]
*  federal law and there was no measure or mechanism to prove it. We have a lot of improvements that [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3246.48s)]
*  we'll continue to make. The save act was never signed into law because they, you know, Chuck [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3251.12s)]
*  Schumer killed it in the Senate. But we're going to keep doing that and we've got to keep restoring [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3254.48s)]
*  the people's trust. Cause if we do not have a free and fair election that people trust, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3258.88s)]
*  that undermines the, the entire system of our government. I mean, it is the premise of our [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3263.28s)]
*  government and our Republic. January 6th coup insurrection, riot, unfortunate day. Like what's [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3268.4s)]
*  the big TLDR takeaway from that day? Well, I, it was a sad day in America. I mean, I was on the [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3273.44s)]
*  floor when it happened and we, I honest to God, I did not know what was happening. We heard voices [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3280.56s)]
*  coming down the hall because it echoes around the marble. I was on the floor making the argument [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3286.4s)]
*  about my electoral account, you know, my, my brilliant constitutional argument and no one heard [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3289.76s)]
*  it because it was so crazy. And I had just yielded the floor to Lauren Boebert, your favorite person. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3293.44s)]
*  Yeah. And she was given an impassioned plea and suddenly the Capitol police come in, they grab [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3297.2000000000003s)]
*  the vice president and move him out of the, out of the chamber. As soon as we heard the noise and [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3303.12s)]
*  we all thought, my first thought was it's a terrorist attack. I thought they were terrorists, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3307.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, invading the building. We didn't, I didn't even know there was a rally or anything. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3312.3199999999997s)]
*  I was so deeply involved in the legal aspect of what we were doing that day. And then everything [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3315.2s)]
*  that happened, you know, volumes have been written about it and maybe I'll write about it one day as [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3320.24s)]
*  well, but it was just surreal. And I was walking from the chamber to the whole, the secret hold [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3323.68s)]
*  place. They ushered us through in the, in the tunnels and all that. And, and somebody, I can't [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3328.0s)]
*  remember, one of my colleagues was walking and he said, you do this. And he hands me the phone. I [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3333.28s)]
*  said, who is it? He says Fox News Live. I can't do it. He was too shaken. So hello, it's Bill Hemmer. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3336.32s)]
*  So I go live real time. This is still on my Facebook page, January 6th. You can go see it. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3341.2s)]
*  And it was just the raw emotion of what I was feeling at the time and how just in my soul, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3346.0s)]
*  it was so disturbing because to have this in the chamber during that thing, when we were actually [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3350.48s)]
*  had real legal arguments, what it meant to the country and the whole thing, it was just a really [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3355.76s)]
*  sad day. And I just said, like, we're better than this. You know, our people are better than this. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3359.6000000000004s)]
*  Our nation is better than this. And I don't know, that was, my view hasn't changed from that day. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3365.0400000000004s)]
*  It's, we did it better January 6th this time. That's the way it should be done. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3371.2000000000003s)]
*  The peaceful transfer of power is an important part of our Republic. And that's something [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3376.0800000000004s)]
*  conservatives and everybody should support. And we do. So. There's many, many questions I want to [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3379.5200000000004s)]
*  ask you on social issues. You're a really passionate pro-lifer. You have views about gay [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3385.28s)]
*  marriage. We don't have time for all of that today. I did want to ask you just one question, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3390.7200000000003s)]
*  though, and that's about the birth rate. Birth rate's a huge issue. Absolutely. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3393.76s)]
*  Social conservatives want to see more kids in the world. Right? Yes. IVF. Where do you stand on that? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3398.7200000000003s)]
*  Is that? I'm pro-IVF. Yeah. I mean, we have a lot of friends and family who have beautiful [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3405.36s)]
*  families because of that. And they had trouble conceiving. And I regard that as a great blessing. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3409.92s)]
*  Now, here's the thing. It can't be unrestricted. Well, why did so many people block the IVF bill, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3414.72s)]
*  colleagues of yours in the Senate, a few months ago? Because they have the same concern that I do. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3420.3199999999997s)]
*  If you have it in a state that has no restrictions, then you wind up with frozen embryos that, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3423.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, are stored in freezers. And if you believe, as I do, that life begins at conception, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3429.2799999999997s)]
*  that's a serious problem. Those are, you know, that's life. And what do you do with that? Do [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3435.04s)]
*  you just dispose it like, you know, yesterday's trash? I mean, that's a real, heavy, moral, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3439.68s)]
*  ethical dilemma. And some of the states haven't wrestled with it at all. They just allow this [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3445.2799999999997s)]
*  unrestricted. So in my state in Louisiana, I think has struck the balance right, that there's a [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3449.3599999999997s)]
*  limited number that you can have and there are limitations on all that. I think you got to be [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3454.24s)]
*  very careful about it, you know. But I don't think you throw the baby out with the bathwater, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3458.3999999999996s)]
*  no pun intended. You don't just get rid of IVF because it's been a great blessing to a lot of [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3462.7999999999997s)]
*  people. And I think it's an innovation in medicine that's been very helpful. Okay, quick [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3466.4s)]
*  lightning round and then I'm going to let you snooze with everyone here. Okay, great. You ready? Yeah. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3472.7200000000003s)]
*  Should America buy Greenland? For the right price. No, I'm kidding. I don't know. I understand [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3476.48s)]
*  strategically it could be a great thing for us, but I'm not sure we have the money to do that [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3483.6s)]
*  right now. That's my concern. If Greenland joins the U.S., should it have some kind of representation [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3487.76s)]
*  in the House? House but not Senate. No, I'm just kidding. I'm very concerned really. This is a real [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3492.48s)]
*  thing. I don't want to have two more Democrat senators joining the chamber. I mean really. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3497.84s)]
*  So call me a protectionist in that regard. Your job is to be the primary fundraiser for your party. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3502.96s)]
*  What's the worst part about asking people for money? Well, I've gotten better at it. The most [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3507.84s)]
*  money I've ever raised in a cycle I think is like 1.2 million before becoming speaker. Last year by [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3512.88s)]
*  some miracle of God I raised 332 million. And I didn't think that was possible, but people were [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3517.36s)]
*  very motivated and I had to like leave it all in the field. But I genuinely enjoyed meeting [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3522.48s)]
*  what some people call the donor class. Some of the greatest Americans are those of means who are [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3528.56s)]
*  self-made who come from humble beginnings and they care so much about the country and they'll open [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3533.04s)]
*  the checkbook and write large amounts because they care about the principle and living in the [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3536.56s)]
*  greatest country. It was so rewarding. Why are Democrats better at raising money than Republicans [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3542.0s)]
*  or at least have been in recent years? Well because they'll cheat and no I'm just kidding. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3546.0s)]
*  No really this is a serious thing. ActBlue I believe is a money laundering organization. I [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3550.96s)]
*  really do and there's some evidence now that's being developed. I think there'll be some [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3555.12s)]
*  investigations probably litigation maybe prosecutions. But we there are examples that [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3558.48s)]
*  have been proven that they there were some large checks probably taken from overseas. I don't know [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3563.52s)]
*  that's that's the conjecture and they broke it down into smaller denominations and sent it through [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3568.08s)]
*  their system by using you know false identification. They grabbed names of this is [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3572.08s)]
*  allegedly okay but I think it could be proven that they took names of people on photo rolls [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3577.12s)]
*  in various states and said they're ActBlue donors when they had no idea. They started a website [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3581.68s)]
*  called checkmydonation.org and people were running it through and they it has been informed I've been [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3585.52s)]
*  informed. They have thousands upon thousands of people who are supposedly donors that never had [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3591.12s)]
*  any knowledge of it. That's a serious problem. So we'll see how the investigations come out but I [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3597.04s)]
*  mean that's a big allegation and if it is proven that would be a sea change in the election cycle [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3601.76s)]
*  because ActBlue is truly I mean they reach billions and billions of dollars. Should there be a Twitter [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3607.2000000000003s)]
*  files equivalent for the federal government for the NIH for example? Yeah sure I mean I think [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3611.28s)]
*  transparency is very important and government's too big and it hides too much. You have two nicknames [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3616.1600000000003s)]
*  on Capitol Hill Maga Mike and Magic Mike. Which one do you prefer? Geez I don't know all of it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3621.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm called much worse so I'll take both of those. It depends on who you ask. The conservative activist [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3629.36s)]
*  David Barton a longtime friend of yours once summed you up this way he'll make you smile before he [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3633.52s)]
*  hits you in the mouth so that you won't bloody your lips when he breaks your teeth. Wow. Accurate? Well [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3638.56s)]
*  I like that no I'm just I'm look Ronald Reagan was described this way. He said he I think it was [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3645.1200000000003s)]
*  uh Jim Baker. Bigot to Reagan. No no no no because he's the model for me. He was described he said he's like a [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3651.04s)]
*  silky soft pillow with a with an iron bar. Is that you? I mean I like to try to do that I mean you know [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3656.56s)]
*  he was unshakable but he he genuine he was a happy warrior because he genuinely loved everybody and [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3662.08s)]
*  and Mike Huckabee said something one time he's running for governor of Arkansas many years ago [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3667.12s)]
*  and he said you know what I'm a conservative but I'm not mad at anybody about it you know like [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3671.12s)]
*  that's kind of my ethos you know. What's the most urgent domestic problem one thing one word most [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3675.44s)]
*  urgent? Well the open border I mean it was reflected in the election everybody knows that. Most urgent [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3680.56s)]
*  international problem? This conflict in Israel I think we got to resolve it the right way. Who's [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3686.16s)]
*  your favorite Democrat in the house? I got a lot of Democrat friends in the house. Favorite. I mean [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3690.7999999999997s)]
*  well I spend the most time with Hakeem Jeffries right now and you know what we have a great [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3695.3599999999997s)]
*  relationship of trust and uh we're trying to change the atmosphere instead of the two leaders [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3698.96s)]
*  of the parties killing each other every day we're trying to model civility again. The Democrats are [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3702.96s)]
*  in the wilderness someone's going to come and be the new standard bearer is that going to come from [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3707.68s)]
*  someone already in Washington or someone from the outside? It's a great question I don't think they [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3711.2799999999997s)]
*  can answer it themselves they're looking for a leader and we'll see how it evolves I don't [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3715.04s)]
*  there's they got a short bench you know. Richard Nixon once famously prayed on his knees in the [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3718.72s)]
*  White House in the Lincoln Bench Room with Henry Kissinger have you ever prayed with Donald Trump? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3724.08s)]
*  Yes yeah and I've talked to him a lot about the hand of providence and how I'm convinced that God [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3729.68s)]
*  spared his life twice on the world stage two assassination attempts within 65 days or whatever [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3735.84s)]
*  it was and right after the second assassination attempt this is interesting footnote in history [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3740.72s)]
*  but I arrived at Mar-a-Lago right after that event we were scheduled to meet and everything was shut [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3745.52s)]

*  amount of time and and it occurred to him and it was shake any man any man he's one of the strongest [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3765.68s)]
*  people I've ever known but he was um he was very contemplative in that moment and we and I we I [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3770.08s)]
*  talked to him again that day about providence and like this is not an accident I don't believe in [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3776.24s)]
*  coincidence sir I think you know this is a phenomenal thing and I believe God's going to [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3780.3199999999997s)]

*  and that's a profound thing for anybody to contemplate I think he does that he's been [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3798.64s)]
*  talking about he talks about providence he talks about how he believes in God more than ever and [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVTb-9xnAN0&t=3802.3199999999997s)]
