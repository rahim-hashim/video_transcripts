It’s been four days since the diplomatic earthquake went down in the Oval Office between President Donald Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. The world is still feeling the aftershocks.

In Europe, leaders have been jolted into action. Ukraine’s European allies, including British prime minister Keir Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron, met in London on Sunday to forge their own peace plan and agree on additional support for Kyiv.

In Moscow, officials are celebrating Trump’s approach to the conflict—and his foreign policy more generally. “The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,” said a Kremlin spokesman. Russian state TV described a new world order with Trump in the White House.

In Washington, administration officials have made it clear that it is up to Zelensky to apologize and patch things up if there is any chance of a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal. “The president believes Zelensky has to come back to the table and he has to be the one to come and make it right,” one official told NBC News.

The Zelensky-Trump bust-up—and the war in Ukraine in general—is one of those important subjects where people we respect (including inside The Free Press newsroom) passionately disagree. There are plenty of other outlets that will give you only one strongly expressed view. But it is our conviction that the only way we can get to the truth is by seriously considering multiple perspectives.

The differences of opinion start with the question of what, exactly, we all watched on Friday.

Were Trump and Vance bullying a besieged ally in public? Or were we watching the White House finally stand up for American taxpayers?

Today we’ve brought together a group of people who answer those questions quite differently: Free Press columnist Batya Ungar-Sargon, Democratic fundraiser and strategist Brianna Wu, and special guest Christopher Caldwell, author of multiple books, including The Age of Entitlement.

# A Clash in the Oval Office—Who Started It?
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0)
*  We obviously have to start with ground zero and ground zero here is this 50 minute extremely heated exchange. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=0.0s)]
*  I would say I've been alive for 40 years. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=7.8s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it happen in public between President Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Zelensky. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=9.8s)]
*  And I think those 50 minutes are a little bit like that dress. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=18.8s)]
*  You guys might remember that dominated the Internet a few years ago. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=22.7s)]
*  Was it golden white or was it brown and blue and everyone saw it differently and was completely? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=26.2s)]
*  Confident that the colors they saw were the true colors. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=33.1s)]
*  So I want to just start by setting the table. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=36.5s)]
*  What did each of you see and maybe Brianna let's start with you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=39.3s)]
*  I mean, I feel like everyone was performing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=44.6s)]
*  I think it's really silly to pretend that someone that gets to the top of their profession like all these people don't understand when they're on camera. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Don't understand what the stakes are aren't figuring out the angles. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=55.3s)]
*  So let's get some really masterful and even with the stress over the impeachment in the past, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  you know, he's been very willing to reset his relationship with Trump move forward on that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=63.3s)]
*  So I think everyone here is performing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  So what I saw was Zelensky. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=70.8s)]
*  Yes, he lost his temper and he knew what he was doing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=72.8s)]
*  He was he was inflaming the Democratic base to go against Trump and kind of solidifying the world who is not inclined to like our president that much. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=76.4s)]
*  You know, I think JD Vance understands he's going to take a different tact than our last vice president be very acquiescent to Trump really have his back on everything. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=85.2s)]
*  And I think Trump he enjoys being praised. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=93.9s)]
*  He enjoys looking like the big man. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=96.0s)]
*  And I think everyone was playing their part here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  It just happened that all those parts created a beautiful devastating train wreck that you could not look away from. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=100.3s)]
*  I was at a dinner on Friday night and this is all anyone was talking about. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=106.7s)]
*  And I think the big question that we all had sort of sitting down having just watched it was who started it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=111.7s)]
*  Right. Was it JD Vance that was sort of bullying? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=118.4s)]
*  Because for my cards on the table, I felt like Trump was the adult in the room. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=121.3s)]
*  He was to my mind, it's Friday afternoon. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  He's probably exhausted. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=131.4s)]
*  He all of the terms of the deal what he calls the rare earths, but the minerals have sort of been predetermined. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=132.9s)]
*  It's a photo op. It's a formality. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=139.7s)]
*  And I really saw the conflict as being between Vance and Zelensky. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=141.9s)]
*  And I think the big question is who baited who? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=146.4s)]
*  Bacia, how did you see it? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=149.9s)]
*  So first of all, the first 40 minutes and the last 10 minutes in which the blowup happened, it's night and day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=151.5s)]
*  Right. And you can tell which commentators did not bother to watch the whole thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=158.6s)]
*  For example, Trump actually defended Zelensky's sweatsuit during the 40 minutes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=164.0s)]
*  There was a very funny moment where a Trump friendly journalist sort of said, why can't you put on a suit? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=171.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking to myself, I wonder if this is bothering Trump as well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  But five minutes later, Trump sort of jumped in and stood up for him. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  So it was a very pleasant, calm meeting for those 40 minutes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  Although Zelensky was continuously undermining the terms of the deal by insisting again and again that he required security guarantees from the United States, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=190.4s)]
*  it seemed to me of the type that is usually reserved for a NATO ally, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  meaning that he was undermining the whole point of this economic agreement, which is supposed to be instead of NATO membership, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=207.4s)]
*  instead of continued US military support, which is extremely important to Donald Trump to end. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=217.0s)]
*  And so, you know, when you see all of that and Zelensky twice in the meeting actually rolled his eyes when Donald Trump started to say, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  and you know, if I had been president, it would have never happened. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=231.5s)]
*  You know, Trump likes to say that he literally rolled his eyes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=234.6s)]
*  And at that point, I started to get very, very upset and uncomfortable. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=237.6s)]
*  The idea that a vassal would come to a superpower with that level of arrogance and that level of willingness to offend, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=241.7s)]
*  you know, JD Vance then did ask a provocative question. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=252.0s)]
*  He made a provocative statement, at which point Zelensky just unleashed and allowed himself to truly disrespect the office, I felt. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=256.0s)]
*  And what Trump did in that moment was he stood up for the American people and the American taxpayer against an international fleecing, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=264.1s)]
*  not just of Ukraine, but from my view of the entire post-war liberal order, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=276.3s)]
*  which the American working class has really borne the brunt of to the benefit of the global elites. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=281.70000000000005s)]
*  And it was absolutely astonishing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=288.5s)]
*  Trump was not angry on his own behalf. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=290.70000000000005s)]
*  Trump was angry on our behalf. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=293.7s)]
*  And I can't say that I've ever seen a president stand up for me so powerfully as I did in that moment. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=296.4s)]
*  Okay, obviously, a tremendous amount there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=302.9s)]
*  I want to go deeper into the details of the deal in a little bit and also the sort of meta-implication, Batya, that you just went to. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=305.7s)]
*  Let's stay on the moment for a second. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=313.2s)]
*  And Chris, I want to bring you in here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=315.4s)]
*  You know, many people watched the video and felt like Vance felt the opposite of what Batya just expressed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=317.4s)]
*  Not that the president and the vice president were standing up for the American taxpayer, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=324.5s)]
*  but they were dressing down, even if he wore the wrong clothes, even if he should have had a translator, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=328.5s)]
*  even if he was, you know, a little bit rude, that fundamentally what we were watching was the dressing down of a war-weary besieged ally in public. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  And it looked to a lot of people like strong people punching down against a weak person. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=344.1s)]
*  You wrote, Chris, in the Free Press today this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=351.9s)]
*  Zelensky had played a Trumpian trick, which I want you to explain, but he won a Trumpian victory. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=354.5s)]
*  And for now, it looks like a puric one. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=360.0s)]
*  So break it down for us. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=362.4s)]
*  What you stipulated in this article is that, you know, Zelensky and Trump, it's kind of like the perfect litmus test. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=364.8s)]
*  People that love Trump hate Zelensky. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=372.1s)]
*  People that love Zelensky hate Trump. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=374.70000000000005s)]
*  But what you point out is that other than Trump himself, Zelensky is the most Trump-like leader on the political scene. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=377.0s)]
*  So talk to us about that and how you saw those 50 minutes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=384.5s)]
*  If I'd seen only the last 10 minutes, I have to say those 10 minutes made me quite uncomfortable. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=388.3s)]
*  My views are probably closer to Brianna's. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=395.0s)]
*  I, you know, JD Vance is a tremendously talented guy in a kind of a confrontation. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=398.3s)]
*  Just think back to his debate with Tim Walz. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=410.1s)]
*  But he really seemed to be bearing down on Zelensky, and he looked a bit like a sidekick. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=413.90000000000003s)]
*  And the way the room was set up at the time, you know, Trump, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=422.1s)]
*  it's just a big difference between Trump 1 and Trump 2. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=426.7s)]
*  During Trump 1, Trump was the same kind of tough guy. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  But there were so many moments when he was just alone. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=434.8s)]
*  When Trump, you know, in his first term, Trump was always like the kid sitting on the couch outside the principal's office. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=438.2s)]
*  He was, you know, he was independent. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=446.2s)]
*  He was bold, but he was constantly getting schooled. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=449.9s)]
*  Now Trump is kind of cool in Washington, and he's got a whole posse of really smart and talented people. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=454.6s)]
*  He's got, you know, he's got Marco Rubio. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  He's got Vance, who, as I say, is very bright. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=467.20000000000005s)]
*  He's got Scott Besant, who's from the very pinnacle of the financial world. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=470.8s)]
*  And so there was a big, Trump had a big crowd in there, and it was Zelensky who was all alone. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=476.1s)]
*  And so it did feel like he was getting beat up on. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=482.6s)]
*  However, you know, as Batya and you say, it, Zelensky was undermining this deal he'd come to sign the whole time. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=486.20000000000005s)]
*  And that's what I mean by his being very much like Trump. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=496.3s)]
*  I would say if there is a, if there's a maneuver that's archetypally Trump, it's to ignore the ground rules and the frameworks and the traditions of any venue. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=501.7s)]
*  You say, you just show up and say, OK, this is supposed to be a presidential debate, and we've had them every year for the last 60 years. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=517.1s)]
*  But I don't care. I'm not going to answer that question. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=523.8s)]
*  I'm going to talk about, you know, dogs and cats. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=527.1s)]
*  And it's what he wants to do. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=530.4s)]
*  And he steals the show. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=532.9s)]
*  And that's what Zelensky was doing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=534.9s)]
*  And you've got to remember, Zelensky is one of the most successful television producers in Europe. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=538.7s)]
*  Zelensky's a really smart guy at doing exactly this, at grabbing eyeballs. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=547.3s)]
*  And so he was doing this and he was sort of, he was sort of narrating a kind of different minerals agreement than the one I assume they're signing, although I don't know the details of it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=553.3000000000001s)]
*  And it began to dawn on Trump, I would say about halfway into the meeting. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=564.7s)]
*  And then Vance got uncomfortable. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=569.9000000000001s)]
*  But the thing that you see, the thing that precipitated Vance's outburst is the very last thing before the part of the tape that we usually watch, is that Trump went into his thing about what a terrible president Biden was and how little he'd actually done. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=572.4s)]
*  And Zelensky came to Biden's defense. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=593.8s)]
*  Zelensky spoke in such a way, I forget exactly what he said, but he said, you know, Biden in Europe were really pretty great, is essentially what he said. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=597.5s)]
*  And that was sort of like really pulling the oratorical rug out from under Trump. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=605.6s)]
*  And that was when I think Vance really made it confrontational. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=610.8s)]
*  I think that one of the key things being debated right now is whether or not Zelensky was poorly advised and didn't and wasn't adept enough to read the room, or if he had become sort of so confident, having been working with administration in Biden that was, you know, so sympathetic to him. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=617.1s)]
*  He obviously spoke this summer at a Pennsylvania rally. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=638.5s)]
*  Harris wasn't there, but it was essentially a Harris Democratic rally. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=641.1s)]
*  You know, he's photographed by Annie Leibovitz in Vanity Fair, and like perhaps he didn't get the memo about the new administration in the vibe shift. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=646.2s)]
*  What do you guys think it was? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=654.2s)]
*  I think that he is making a very deliberate calculation here. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=655.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, I think just a little bit of a history lesson is worth like revisiting because I think it reframes what we all saw on camera. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=659.3000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, before all of this happened, Ukraine made a deal to give up like nuclear weapons. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=666.9s)]
*  They're not going to have nuclear weapons, basically getting a peace agreement. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=673.3s)]
*  And I think all of us realize in retrospect that if Ukraine had had nuclear weapons, they would not be in this mess today. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=677.3s)]
*  So they've gotten into these agreements with other countries before that functionally like left them a lot less safe. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=684.1s)]
*  So, Bacha, I hear what you're saying about the tone shift there, and maybe it's a little aggressive when Zelensky is coming in there and asking for A, B and C. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=690.7s)]
*  I think from his point of view, not getting those kinds of security assurances, not having that spelled out who would be with him and where. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  I think that's a lot of the reason he's in this mess to begin with. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=709.1s)]
*  And I also just respectfully want to push back on something I've seen you say a lot, which is talking about this being the U.S. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=712.2s)]
*  taxpayers like funneling money towards Ukraine. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=718.5s)]
*  Here's the facts on this, and anyone can look this up. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=721.3s)]
*  The United States has the biggest military on Earth. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=724.1999999999999s)]
*  We have tons of weapons and we keep them in depots. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=726.6s)]
*  And the deal that has been worked out is Congress is allocating money to fund new weapon creation. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=730.3s)]
*  So the United States gets newer weapons, gets better weapons, gets more lethal weapons, and then we retire older weapons and those are going over to Ukraine. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=736.6999999999999s)]
*  Those weapons, even if we had done nothing here, would have cost the American taxpayer a certain amount of money to decommission and take apart so people can't use them and people are safe. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=746.3s)]
*  So I think it is an incomplete answer to paint this as so the American taxpayers being fleeced. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=755.6999999999999s)]
*  The truth is the American military is getting upgraded and Ukraine is getting older weapons that we were going to decommission anyway. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  Brianna, why are people so compelled then by the idea and to be crude about it? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=769.0s)]
*  I feel like the way the debate plays out in public is look at these hollowed out, abandoned, you know, American towns, many of which Batya writes about in the book that's just behind her shoulder, conveniently placed. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=774.1s)]
*  You know, why are we sending billions of dollars to Ukraine and other foreign countries when they should be going to the American people? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=790.3000000000001s)]
*  Explain why that's a false dichotomy. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=795.4s)]
*  You don't have to sell me on that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=797.2s)]
*  I grew up in Mississippi and what I would love more than anything. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=799.2s)]
*  We've got brilliant shipyards in Mississippi. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=802.5s)]
*  I think we're heading for a hot war with China. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=805.0s)]
*  I would love for us to double down on funding the military. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=806.9s)]
*  We get jobs for Americans when we fund the military. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=809.6s)]
*  In fact, many of the weapons that this appropriations bill is funding, it actually goes to create American jobs. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=812.7s)]
*  So if we want to structure that in a way that brings economic prosperity to some of these small towns 100% on it, and I get it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=820.4s)]
*  I really do. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=829.3s)]
*  I come from a town literally with a gas station and a graveyard and that's it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=830.1s)]
*  So you don't have to sell me that places like that need investment. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=835.6s)]
*  I'm just saying it's not always one or the other. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=839.2s)]
*  It's not all or nothing on this 100%. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=841.9s)]
*  We get something from America being a world leader that directly translates into economic prosperity for Americans. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=845.1s)]
*  We have a higher standard of living than Canada. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=853.5s)]
*  We have a higher standard of living of most countries and that is because of this role in leadership that America has taken on. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=855.9s)]
*  So respectfully, the people that want us to withdraw from all of that, I think they don't understand that Russia, India, China, they're going to come into these power vacuums. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=863.0s)]
*  They are going to make these trade deals and it's going to leave the American people poor with less money in their pocket. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrsq1uEAh0&t=872.4s)]
