I’m sure you remember the images of Kfir and Ariel Bibas.

They were just nine months and four years old when they were kidnapped by Hamas along with their mother, Shiri, on October 7, 2023. It was impossible to look at the image of her shielding them, her eyes full of terror, the children clinging to her, and not think of the Holocaust.

For more than 500 days, people around the world prayed for the safe return of these babies. Our hopes were raised on February 1, when the fourth member of the family—Yarden Bibas—was liberated after 484 days in Hamas captivity.

But as this episode goes live, Kfir, Ariel, and Shiri Bibas won’t be returning home alive. Hamas instead will hand over their remains.

How can Israel live alongside an enemy that kidnaps and murders babies? And what does it mean for us to live in a world, where people in the West tore down posters of the Bibas children.

Before the devastating news of the Bibas children broke, Bari sat down with Matti Friedman, Free Press correspondent in Jerusalem. They happened to talk on the very day that Kfir and Ariel’s father, Yarden, was released after being kept in unimaginable conditions. Now Yarden confronts the nightmare that his entire family was murdered.

Bari and Matti talk about the toll of this war, why returning the hostages is so fundamentally important to the future of Israel, about the rise of anti-Jewish hate, and about how to be American, Jewish, and Zionist all at the same time, and how Jews are waking up to a new reality in 2025.

# How Activists Hijacked Our Institutions
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo)
*  I wrote these essays and I realized we've mentioned them a few times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=0.0s)]
*  They're an analysis of the malfunctioning of the press in Israel. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=2.6s)]
*  And I gave a lot of examples about the scope of coverage. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=6.28s)]
*  For example, we had more reporters when I was at the AP covering Israel than we had [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=10.0s)]
*  covering the entire continent of Africa, south of the Sahara. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=13.4s)]
*  That's 50-something countries. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=16.84s)]
*  We had more people in Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=17.84s)]
*  Israel is one one hundredth of one percent of the world's surface. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=20.12s)]
*  Sometimes I say, you know, we covered Israel more than we covered China. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  And if I'm speaking to Jews, people just look at me blankly. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=26.72s)]
*  Because of course. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=29.88s)]
*  I mean, people don't like the content of the coverage, but they think the scope is completely [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=32.28s)]
*  rational. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  But, you know, if we understand that the news is a rational attempt to understand events [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  on planet Earth, then you cannot cover Israel more than 1.3 billion people in India, which [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=43.92s)]
*  we did. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=48.36s)]
*  And I could go on and on. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=49.36s)]
*  And that was part of what the article was about. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=50.36s)]
*  But it really was about, in retrospect, something that was happening across the press corps [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=51.36s)]
*  and not just in the press corps, it was happening across liberal institutions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=54.24s)]
*  You mentioned the Academy, you know, human rights, NGOs, the ACLU, you know, pillars [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=57.36s)]
*  of the liberal West in the past 20 years or so, 50 years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=63.52s)]
*  The International Criminal Court. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=65.76s)]
*  The ICC, Arms of the United Nations. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=67.6s)]
*  And they've been kind of gutted by activists and repurposed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  And they fly under the same names, which makes it very confusing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=74.56s)]
*  But they are fundamentally different institutions with different goals. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=77.64s)]
*  And that's what I was surprised to find at the AP, that many of the people making decisions, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=80.4s)]
*  not everyone in the Bureau, but many of the people making decisions were activists. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  They weren't interested in explaining complicated reality. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=88.64s)]
*  They were interested in swaying readers toward the correct political conclusion. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  And if that is your goal, then you choose completely different stories and you present [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  them in a completely different way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=98.2s)]
*  So if in Israel, the idea is to sway people toward supporting the cause of justice, that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  is the Palestinians, then any story that makes Israel's position seem reasonable, they can't [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  be reported. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I have examples of that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=109.12s)]
*  And any story that makes the Palestinians seem reasonable, then you report it, inflate it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=110.12s)]
*  And that's a big cause of the misunderstanding. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  But it's not limited to Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=116.48s)]
*  It's true of American politics. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=118.92s)]
*  It's true of gender. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  It's true of the origins of COVID. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=122.2s)]
*  There are many, many examples where the press really dropped the ball. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=123.52s)]
*  And that's what I was trying to do in those essays. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=127.68s)]
*  Did they have an impact? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=129.4s)]
*  Did they have an impact? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=130.88s)]
*  Since I wrote those essays in 2014, press coverage of Israel has been superb. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=132.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=136.88s)]
*  Everything. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=138.28s)]
*  People just read those essays and they said, you know what? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=139.28s)]
*  This Canadian guy, he's right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=142.88s)]
*  And they changed everything. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=144.12s)]
*  Since then, it's been too positive in my opinion. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=146.84s)]
*  It really has. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=149.28s)]
*  It didn't make a difference. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=150.28s)]
*  And I really felt like I was a guy in a rowboat, kind of whacking the side of the aircraft [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=151.28s)]
*  carrier and no one noticing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=155.12s)]
*  But what did happen is that, not because of the essays, but because this was happening [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=158.56s)]
*  in a context where a lot of people were losing faith in the institutions. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=162.84s)]
*  I think, unfortunately, quite rightly, that those institutions have lost a lot of their [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  clout. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  And people can read these essays and kind of explain to themselves why this is happening [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  on one particular story that's of interest to me and to people in this room. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  So it has had an effect in that, in this new world where a lot of people are just wandering. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=181.48s)]
*  A lot of centrist, sane people are wandering around homeless, buffeted by misinformation [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=186.12s)]
*  of different kinds. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=190.83999999999997s)]
*  And they're kind of grasping at information that seems reasonable to them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  And some people found those essays 10 years ago. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of people, I think, have found the free press, which you founded. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  And it's kind of, we're all swimming toward islands in the ocean and we're finding each [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=201.76s)]
*  other and we're discovering that actually a lot of people are swimming in the ocean [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=207.92s)]
*  and that there are people who are trying to address this problem. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  So I think it's part of the same process. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=213.56s)]
*  One of the things that I have thought a lot about over the past year is you mentioned [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  how institutions like Harvard still has the Harvard name, the New York Times still has [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=222.8s)]
*  the really beautiful font, but the content of it is completely different. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  And yet the pursuit of truth has nothing to do with what Harvard is about. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  One of the things that has struck me as sort of like a tragedy of the American Jewish story [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=239.12s)]
*  is the fact that there are so many Jewish names affixed to the buildings of those places. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=243.52s)]
*  So, you know, the New York Times, universities, we could go on and on and on. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=252.6s)]
*  But what accounts for that? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=259.8s)]
*  You know, what accounts for, is this something about Jews that were flawed in this way? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=262.44s)]
*  That we sort of, like, the idea of throwing our support behind places that were creating [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=269.76s)]
*  ideas that were literally coming to swallow us alive and seeming to either be ignorant [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=278.8s)]
*  about it or kind of okay with it? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  What explains that tendency? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, this is a very philosophical question and I think there are people in this room [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  who are far better equipped to answer it than I am. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=295.92s)]
*  I live in Israel, which presents me with a whole list of problems, but it saves me a [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  whole list of other problems that you guys have to deal with, like, you know, what's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  going on in the library that my family donated to whatever university, you know, a generation [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=305.32s)]
*  or two ago. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  But it's a real phenomenon and there is, just looking at this in a deeper way, there is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  a kind of a repeating historical phenomenon where Jewish stories and ideas are turned [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=316.67999999999995s)]
*  against Jewish people. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=322.55999999999995s)]
*  So I think you can look at the roots of Christianity and you'll see some of that there where Jewish [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  books become, the Jews are kind of pushed out of the story that they wrote and it's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  turned against them and they become the antagonists of ideas that they had promoted. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=336.48s)]
*  I think you can see it in Holocaust education. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=341.16s)]
*  Anyone who was following the events in Ireland last week saw Holocaust commemoration essentially [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=345.6s)]
*  turned against the Jews who, of course, tell the story of the Holocaust but don't understand [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=350.92s)]
*  it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=355.24s)]
*  The Jews don't understand the story of the Holocaust. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=356.24s)]
*  They think it's about them. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  It's about the Palestinians. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=360.0s)]
*  Actually, it's about the Palestinians and about the victims of power, including Jewish [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=361.0s)]
*  power. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=366.28s)]
*  Someone who's written about this beautifully is Daryl Horn, who is one of my favorite writers [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=367.28s)]
*  and a friend and who's written for the Free Press and she's written about a discomfort [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  in, of course, you know, Jews donated a lot of money for Holocaust education, built Holocaust [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=375.23999999999995s)]
*  museums, made Holocaust movies and in a lot of these museums there's a profound discomfort [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  with the centering of the Jewish story. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=384.11999999999995s)]
*  The Holocaust is supposed to be a generic lesson about injustice and if you promote [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=386.8s)]
*  your own particularism in these places, you're missing the point. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=392.0s)]
*  So there's a recurring phenomenon you can talk about, probably about communism and there [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=396.84s)]
*  are other examples where there are ideas that Jews think will contribute something to the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=401.56s)]
*  world that will improve their place in the world and those ideas or buildings or institutions [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=405.4s)]
*  are turned against them. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=410.56s)]
*  Human Rights Watch, founded by a Jew, Amnesty, founded by kind of a Jew who converted to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=411.96s)]
*  Catholicism but I mean these institutions and there are many more examples of institutions [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=419.12s)]
*  that are founded by... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-vlNQCWdo&t=423.48s)]
