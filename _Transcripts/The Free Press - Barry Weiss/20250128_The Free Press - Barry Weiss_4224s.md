There has been a cultural sea change over the last year when it comes to health in America. It is shepherded by an unexpected coalition of nutritionists, longevity experts, wellness influencers, holistic and functional doctors of medicine, moms wearing babies and natural deodorant, mushroom shamans, and some vaccine skeptics. They’ve gathered under the banner of Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, and they’re here to tell us that plastic cutting boards, Diet Coke, and pasteurized milk—all things that once seemed perfectly normal in American life—are actually killing us.

A decade ago, if you read that list of personas you would think MAHA is some woo-woo, hippie progressive movement. But here we are in 2025, and this is the same group that helped usher Donald Trump to power.

What does MAHA stand for? What does it look like when it marries itself to power? And what will MAHA actually be able to accomplish over the next four years under their fearless leader—and risky Health and Human Services secretary nominee—Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

Live in D.C. during inauguration weekend, Calley Means, Jillian Michaels, and Vani Hari explain.

# Inside the MAHA Revolution | Calley Means, Vani Hari, and Jillian Michaels
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw)
*  From the free press, this is honestly live in DC and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=0.0s)]
*  At the risk of totally grossing out all three of you and everyone in this room, I have a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=5.04s)]
*  few confessions to make. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=9.48s)]
*  I have a plastic cutting board in my kitchen, which my wife regards as like the devil's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=11.6s)]
*  work. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=16.56s)]
*  I have had my forehead injected with chemicals to make me look younger. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=17.56s)]
*  I drink pasteurized milk. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=21.0s)]
*  I do drink diet coke, which my producer calls cancer water, and I could go on, but I do [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=22.88s)]
*  not want to lose my audience. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Now, all of those things, until very recently, seemed perfectly normal in American life. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=29.44s)]
*  Now they seem not just low status and not just outdated, but perhaps clinically insane. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  And that is because of the cultural sea change that we have seen over the last few years, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  and especially, of course, over the last few months. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  And we've seen this because this very unexpected coalition of nutritionists, longevity experts, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=50.32s)]
*  illness influencers, holistic and functional medicine doctors, moms wearing babies and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=57.24s)]
*  no deodorant, mushroom shamans, and yes, some vaccine skeptics, and we'll get to them, who [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=62.64s)]
*  have all gathered together under the banner of Maha. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=67.44s)]
*  Now, a decade ago, if I listed off that group of personas to you, you would think 100% they [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=70.4s)]
*  are liberal, they are progressive. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=77.72s)]
*  Maybe they're off the political map on the left. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=80.0s)]
*  But here we are in 2025, and not only has this group helped usher in Donald Trump to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=83.12s)]
*  power, I think you can make an argument that the Maha movement is perhaps the most powerful [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=88.64s)]
*  political force in American life. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  So what does that movement stand for? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  What does it look like when it actually marries itself to power as the 47th president, becomes [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=99.2s)]
*  the 47th president? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=104.84s)]
*  And what will Maha actually be able to accomplish over these next four years? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=106.56s)]
*  And I cannot think of anyone better to talk about this with on the tiniest stage ever [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=110.68s)]
*  known to man with the following people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=115.64s)]
*  Callie Means, Jillian Michaels, and Vani Hari. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=118.48s)]
*  Guys, thank you so much for being here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  You have incredible bios. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  People should go online and read all about you and follow you on all the social platforms. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=124.28s)]
*  But Callie, who's been on the podcast before, is the founder of TruMed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=128.08s)]
*  He is also the co-author of Good Energy, which he wrote with his sister, Casey Means. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=132.46s)]
*  Casey Means is America's original fitness expert, in my view. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=138.4s)]
*  She's extremely subtle. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  You never know what she thinks about anything. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  She is the author of nine books, I believe. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=143.8s)]
*  And as I was telling her in the green room, if you are trying to get a bridal body, the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  best thing you can do other than ozempic is her 30-day shred. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  I absolutely swear by it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  Other than ozempic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=157.0s)]
*  I have been influenced by you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=158.68s)]
*  You have the right eggs in there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  Like, better than striking. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to get hit in the face. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to get hit in the face. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  Vani is the founder of TruVani. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=165.92s)]
*  You might also know her from her writings as Food Babe. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  She has more than 2 million followers on Instagram. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  And you may remember her as the woman that got Subway to remove, tell me the name of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=174.28s)]
*  the chemical. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=178.16s)]
*  Azodicarbonamide. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=179.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=180.16s)]
*  Otherwise known as the yoga mat chemical from its breads. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=181.16s)]
*  The idea that there was a yoga mat chemical in a bread is kind of the whole purpose of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=184.06s)]
*  this conversation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=188.56s)]
*  So, Callie, Jillian, Vani, thank you so much for being here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=189.56s)]
*  Okay, so I want to kind of start with the politics of it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=194.08s)]
*  Okay? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=197.08s)]
*  The crunchy alternative medicine people who are skeptical of big pharma and big food, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=198.08s)]
*  who didn't, you know, are skeptical of vaccines and the rest, they used to be, as I was mentioning [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  in the introduction, starkly on the left. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=208.24s)]
*  RFK Jr., you know, the beacon of the Maha movement, he was a lifelong Democrat. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=211.0s)]
*  Now this group has found their home on the right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=215.88s)]
*  Explain Callie in a concise way, because it could be a very long answer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=219.0s)]
*  How did we get to this strange political realignment? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=223.16s)]
*  Donald Trump is the reason. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=226.04s)]
*  In 2016, I was a never-crumper. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=228.04s)]
*  And I was kind of the traditional Republican. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=230.92s)]
*  I interned and worked for George W. Bush at the Heritage Foundation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=233.2s)]
*  And back then you learned that good conservatives don't question American institutions, particularly [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=237.68s)]
*  corporations. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=242.6s)]
*  The pharmaceutical industry can do no wrong. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=243.6s)]
*  Big food can do no wrong. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=245.24s)]
*  We're shipping our agriculture and pharmaceutical innovation around the world. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=246.24s)]
*  And I was a little nervous in 2016. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=250.48s)]
*  I think a lot of people were, but when President Trump was calling, you know, for basically [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=251.88s)]
*  calling out corporations, calling out the corpora cronyism. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  And I think what I and I think a lot of people learned is that his theory was right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  The American people are being brought down by crony capitalism. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  And you look across the board, the military industrial complex is making us less secure. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=267.96s)]
*  The education industrial complex is making our kids less educated. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=272.5s)]
*  And there's this healthcare industrial complex. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=275.88s)]
*  43 percent of the U.S. economy profits from either drugging kids or poisoning them, in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=278.08s)]
*  my opinion. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=284.64s)]
*  I mean, fundamentally in the United States, we have a situation where 38 percent of kids [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=285.64s)]
*  are pre-diabetic, where 50 percent of teens are overweight or obese, but it's 3 percent [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=290.4s)]
*  of Japan. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=295.88s)]
*  And then we have the healthcare industry that instead of calling out why that's happening, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=297.28s)]
*  which is clearly because of our ultra-processed food, because we're so sedentary in U.S. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  less time outside than a maximum security prison. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=306.12s)]
*  The fact that we have chronic stress off the charts. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=309.88s)]
*  These fundamental factors aren't being called out. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=312.4s)]
*  The medical system is in fact just watching it happening, profiting. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=314.8s)]
*  I mean, 95 percent of medical spending is intervening after someone gets sick. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=318.32s)]
*  And I think where the politics came together here is that these issues, and I agree with [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=322.92s)]
*  you, at a Trump rally and with Bobby, if you close your eyes, you think you're at a Berkeley [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=327.72s)]
*  seminar, a left-wing seminar. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=331.04s)]
*  As you're talking about the military-industrial conflict, are you Noam Chomsky? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  What Donald Trump did is actually reframe conservatism, that the American people want [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=339.48s)]
*  to thrive, but there's corrupt institutions in the way. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=343.92s)]
*  I think the foundation of Donald Trump's candidacy and his reason for existence is standing in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=346.68s)]
*  the way of the swamp corruption. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=350.72s)]
*  He's redefined a vision. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=352.44s)]
*  I think it's a perfect vision for our time because the defining issue in the world right [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=353.44s)]
*  now, in the developed world, is people crying out this populist uprising. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  And Donald Trump channeled that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=361.44s)]
*  He channeled a vision of standing up against corruption. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  And what happened is there's nothing more representative of the swamp than what's happening [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  to kids, than industries profiting from the kids. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=369.92s)]
*  And in my opinion, Bobby Kennedy was the most MAGA candidate other than Donald Trump. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=373.36s)]
*  And what's happening to health is actually a case study of the foundation of Donald Trump's [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=378.72s)]
*  candidacy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=384.24s)]
*  So them blending together, it was just another proof point of MAGA. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=385.54s)]
*  MAHA is a proof point of MAGA. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=389.64s)]
*  There's corrupt institutions that are profiting from suboptimal outcomes. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  And they were able to combine and unleash this pent-up frustration of moms. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=398.08s)]
*  And I think it's apparent that Vani has channeled. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=403.36s)]
*  Well, let's talk about the moms. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=406.24s)]
*  Because 30 years ago, you remember when it was Clinton v. Dole, soccer moms were the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=407.64s)]
*  thing, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=413.2s)]
*  That was the most that, like it was soccer moms that swayed the election, suburban moms [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=414.2s)]
*  that wanted common sense, pragmatism, you know, of course, like James Carville's famous [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=418.32s)]
*  line, it's the economy's stupid. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=422.68s)]
*  And they found that in the person of Bill Clinton. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=424.08s)]
*  Now I think you can argue that the new soccer mom is the MAHA mom. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=427.0s)]
*  And Vani, I feel like you exemplify that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=431.6s)]
*  You channel it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=435.08s)]
*  You are the tiger mom of this, the MAHA mom movement. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=436.32s)]
*  Like, explain, give us a sense of that world. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=439.96s)]
*  And like, are these women particularly political? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=444.0s)]
*  Have they become political because of seeing what's going on with their kids? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=446.88s)]
*  Like, give us a bit of a picture of that of that world. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=450.36s)]
*  I mean, they're fed up. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  They're fed up with the mass poisoning of our food system. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=454.12s)]
*  They see that American companies are using better, safer ingredients and other products [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=457.36s)]
*  overseas while selling the same version of their product here with more toxic, more poisonous [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  ingredients, everything from Kellogg's cereal and General Mills Lucky Charms to Coca-Cola [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=466.36s)]
*  products and Pepsi-Cola and chips. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=472.0s)]
*  They see the side-by-side graphics that are going viral in their groups online and they're [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=474.6s)]
*  fed up. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=479.48s)]
*  And they're just dying for some healthy food for their children, right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=480.92s)]
*  They just want to hold someone accountable. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=485.02s)]
*  They not only care about their own health, but they're willing to go to bat. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=487.44s)]
*  They're willing to call corporations. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=490.44s)]
*  They're willing to show up at the headquarters. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=491.64s)]
*  I mean, when I was met with, and Callie was there, it was incredible. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=494.32s)]
*  A thousand people on the ground in Battle Creek, Michigan to deliver 400,000 signatures [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=497.32s)]
*  to Kellogg's headquarters. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=503.14s)]
*  I've never seen that kind of movement on the ground, especially in a little town like Battle [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=505.02s)]
*  Creek, Michigan, that there's no direct flights, you know, really. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=509.0s)]
*  You know, you have to really get there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  I have no idea where it is. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=512.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=513.9s)]
*  I mean, it's like an hour and a half south from Grand Rapids, Michigan. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=514.9s)]
*  So yeah, two hours from Detroit. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=518.06s)]
*  But again, this is pent-up frustration about the fact that our kids are suffering more [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=520.9s)]
*  than ever. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=528.18s)]
*  38% of preteens the ages between 12 and 18 are going to be pre-diabetic. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=530.18s)]
*  That's unacceptable. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=535.5s)]
*  In Japan, it's like 3% are obese, right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=536.7399999999999s)]
*  It's insane that the stark differences between us and other countries, and we see it right [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=539.8599999999999s)]
*  now with our moms looking for answers. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=545.5s)]
*  We don't want to medicate our kids. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  We don't want to have to put them on ADHD medication, but our schools are serving them [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=550.18s)]
*  free loops. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=554.4599999999999s)]
*  We've got to do something different. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=555.4599999999999s)]
*  Let's rewind back the clock to 2016. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=556.5799999999999s)]
*  Jillian, you were you said a lot of colorful things about Donald Trump. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=558.74s)]
*  You were not a fan, suffice it to say. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=561.62s)]
*  The reason that I think there's a natural transition to that is because in 2016, one [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=563.94s)]
*  of the things that I think kept a lot of people who were maybe attracted to some of Donald [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=569.58s)]
*  Trump's policies from voting for him was the way that he was going to course in American [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=573.5400000000001s)]
*  life. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=577.6600000000001s)]
*  And a lot of moms, frankly, who heard him on the tape talking about grabbing women by [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=578.6600000000001s)]
*  the pussy, saw the way that he talked about women and thought to themselves, hold on, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  everything is downstream of character. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=587.1800000000001s)]
*  If the president is meant to be the most powerful person in the world, the person that our children [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=588.98s)]
*  are meant to look up to, sorry, I can't hold my nose and vote for him. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=594.94s)]
*  And now you've seen this pretty big sea change over the past eight years, where arguably [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=598.5s)]
*  some of the women moms who didn't want to vote for him, I guess now are holding their [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=602.94s)]
*  nose and doing so. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=607.22s)]
*  And Jillian, I feel like you kind of might be one of them. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=608.7s)]
*  And forgive me if I'm caricaturing. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=611.46s)]
*  No, you're not at all. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=612.9000000000001s)]
*  If we could actually go back a little bit further to before these two had come on to [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=613.98s)]
*  the scene. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=619.6600000000001s)]
*  My very first podcast, I want to say 12, 13 years ago, was with Maria Rodale about her [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=621.46s)]
*  book The Organic Manifesto, which was espousing, like getting back to nature, eating real food. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=627.1800000000001s)]
*  It went on deaf ears. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=635.0200000000001s)]
*  And there was Mark Bittman and Michael Pollan. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=637.22s)]
*  None of it was political. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=639.94s)]
*  None of it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=640.94s)]
*  And it went nowhere. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=642.0600000000001s)]
*  Nowhere. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=643.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=644.06s)]
*  And this is where having an individual like Callie and an individual like Vani, who have [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=645.06s)]
*  made it political, this is the first time you're starting to see change. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=651.5799999999999s)]
*  And I was not political. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=657.06s)]
*  I voted on social issues. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=658.4599999999999s)]
*  The world was good enough. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=660.4599999999999s)]
*  I wanted gay marriage. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=661.8599999999999s)]
*  I wanted equality. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=663.3s)]
*  I mean, I was a liberal. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=664.3s)]
*  I was born in California. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=665.3s)]
*  I was blue through and through. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=666.78s)]
*  And health was nonpartisan. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=668.5s)]
*  And then when these two started convincing politicians to take a position on it, I started [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=670.62s)]
*  to see change for the first time in my 20-year career. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=678.7800000000001s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, what the hell is happening? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=683.1s)]
*  How is this possible? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=688.5s)]
*  And I reached out to Callie and I was like, what can I do to be helpful? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=690.6600000000001s)]
*  I need to have you on my podcast immediately. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=693.98s)]
*  Educate everybody. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=696.62s)]
*  And he kind of brought me along. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=698.26s)]
*  And then other things began to happen. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=701.02s)]
*  You started to see censorship become an issue around health. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=703.1s)]
*  And you started to see, I mean, this is somewhat unrelated, but sex changes for children. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=707.98s)]
*  Like no one's mentioning that our current director of HHS wanted to remove all age limits [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=712.7s)]
*  for sex changes for kids. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=718.66s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=720.7s)]
*  These kinds of things started to make me more political. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=725.3s)]
*  And yes, now when I weigh the pros and cons of each side, I find the positions on the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=731.18s)]
*  left are so radical and so dangerous. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=736.62s)]
*  And we had hoped they would take a stand on the health issue. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=739.78s)]
*  And in fact, Callie told me, like, listen, we're going to talk to anybody. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=742.9399999999999s)]
*  Like you don't need to be a Trump or we're talking to everybody. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=745.9399999999999s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=747.9399999999999s)]
*  The left talked to nobody. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=748.9399999999999s)]
*  They refused to sit down with RFK. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=750.66s)]
*  That was so offensive to me personally. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=754.22s)]
*  And that was the last straw for me. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=757.46s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why you saw Red 3 just being banned this week. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=759.26s)]
*  The White House was holding it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=762.9399999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't do it during the election. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=764.42s)]
*  They didn't want to bring this issue to light. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=766.22s)]
*  And somebody was actually holding. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=769.02s)]
*  We're talking about a food die that the FDA sort of just banned. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=771.26s)]
*  The Biden administration rushing before Trump, days before Trump gets in. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=774.26s)]
*  Just rushing to get it in. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=777.58s)]
*  It's been banned in Europe for a long time. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=778.78s)]
*  But no, it's been banned in cosmetics here for 35 years. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=780.46s)]
*  But not in our food. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=783.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=784.5s)]
*  So you can't use it in lipstick. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=785.5s)]
*  We found 40 years ago that it causes cancer. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=786.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=788.06s)]
*  And this is something they've known about. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=789.06s)]
*  It's been petitioned by every single nonprofit organization. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=791.06s)]
*  Showed them the data, showed them the science that it causes thyroid cancer in rats. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=794.34s)]
*  And under the Delaney cause, it is law that this chemical cannot be in our food supply. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=798.1s)]
*  Why were they holding it back? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=804.02s)]
*  I mean, because of political reasons. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=805.42s)]
*  This is what's made me political. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=807.5s)]
*  Because I think it's absolutely insane that we are harming our human life in America this [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=809.7s)]
*  way. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=817.1s)]
*  So for people that are not familiar with you guys, which, you know, in this room, I know [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=818.1s)]
*  that's not the case, but for people watching, give us just a little bit of a sense of how [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=821.58s)]
*  you became passionate about these issues. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=826.74s)]
*  I know, Callie, for you, it was your mom and her cancer and how quickly, and the effect [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=829.5s)]
*  that you and your sister feel food and diet and environment had on her. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=837.1400000000001s)]
*  What about each of you? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=841.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I grew up with two immigrant Indian parents and they had an arranged marriage. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=843.34s)]
*  My dad had been living here for several years to go to school and he married my mom, met [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=847.98s)]
*  her five days later, brought her to the United States. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=853.2600000000001s)]
*  She lived here for the rest of her life and he says, you know, if we're going to be Americans, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=855.46s)]
*  we're going to eat like Americans. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=857.86s)]
*  And here is a McDonald's hamburger. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=859.5s)]
*  And that is how I was raised. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=862.6600000000001s)]
*  I ate processed food, processed food, and as a result, I was in and out of the doctor's [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=865.0600000000001s)]
*  offices most of my life. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=868.7800000000001s)]
*  And it was not until my early 20s on nine prescription drugs, overweight, in the hospital [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=870.5400000000001s)]
*  getting an organ taken out of my body that I woke up and said, something's not right. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=875.5s)]
*  I need to look into this. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=880.58s)]
*  And I channeled this energy that I learned in high school on how to debate and how to [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=881.9000000000001s)]
*  research. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=885.1400000000001s)]
*  Back then we didn't have Google. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=886.1400000000001s)]
*  So I went to the library, checked out big books on nutrition, and there was this concept [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=887.3000000000001s)]
*  in one of them that just hit me on the head. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=891.5s)]
*  And it was that the majority of foods on the grocery store shelves are dead. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=894.02s)]
*  And I said, that's how I felt for most of my life. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=899.5400000000001s)]
*  How do I eat live food? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=902.02s)]
*  How do I eat real food? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=903.5s)]
*  And when I switched my diet, I went off nine prescription drugs, never had a diet again, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=905.26s)]
*  lost all the weight, started to live a life that I never thought was possible, so dramatic [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=910.5s)]
*  that the friends and the family and everyone around me that saw me grow up in this miserable [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=915.46s)]
*  position said, I want to have what you're having. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=919.34s)]
*  And so I started a blog. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=923.6600000000001s)]
*  And before starting the blog, I was never on social media because I thought I wanted [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=925.0600000000001s)]
*  to run for office one day. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=928.46s)]
*  And that's definitely happening. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=930.62s)]
*  Well, you know, I was scared to put anything personal online at that point. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=932.98s)]
*  And so then I was like, OK, well, everyone's like, you have to join Facebook because no [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=939.0600000000001s)]
*  one's going to read your blog. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=942.22s)]
*  Otherwise, that's how we share everything. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=943.22s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, I'll join Facebook. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=944.22s)]
*  And I wanted to call it eat healthy, live forever dot com. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=946.98s)]
*  My husband, who's a tech geek in the family, thought that was a stupid name and says, how [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=949.66s)]
*  about food, babe? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=953.38s)]
*  It's available ten dollars on auction. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=954.38s)]
*  And I said, OK, oh, well, I didn't feel like a food babe for most of my life. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=956.46s)]
*  But why don't I teach other people to become a food babe? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=959.58s)]
*  And I kind of hid behind this persona because I was still working in the corporate world, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=961.3000000000001s)]
*  working for C. Lowe executives at big banks. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=965.3000000000001s)]
*  And I had this other passion to teach people the truth about what was happening in the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=968.1800000000001s)]
*  food industry. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=971.86s)]
*  When I started to uncover the ingredients behind these popular food products, fast food, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=973.1800000000001s)]
*  etc., and release them on the blog for the first time, really for anyone to see online, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=979.46s)]
*  that is when this awakening started, where people were like, what? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=985.82s)]
*  I'm eating 100 chemicals in a Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=988.86s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=992.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=994.3000000000001s)]
*  And it was that that led me to changing several billion dollar corporations for the better. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  But then I had kids, right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1001.58s)]
*  I had kids and I had to make a shift. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1003.1s)]
*  And so I decided to change the food industry from the inside and start my own company, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1005.14s)]
*  Truvani. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1008.86s)]
*  But then Callie called and Callie. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1011.14s)]
*  How is really like the nexus? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1015.0200000000001s)]
*  Actually, what I what the truth is, I saw Callie talking about all of the issues that [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1016.46s)]
*  I felt so deeply about for most of my life and that I've fought for. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1024.5s)]
*  And he was saying it in a new way that I was energized and it was electric. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1029.02s)]
*  And I reached out to him. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1035.14s)]
*  We should find the Instagram post that I or the DM that I sent him. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1036.54s)]
*  I said, I want to just connect with you. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1039.7s)]
*  I had no interest in getting into any of this. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1041.94s)]
*  I said, I just want to connect to you. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1045.3400000000001s)]
*  And we talked on the phone, I don't know, 20 minutes. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1046.8600000000001s)]
*  We connected in a week later. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1050.46s)]
*  We're taking on Kellogg's. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1052.74s)]
*  So it was it was meant to be. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1054.46s)]
*  And I have to tell you, he is literally ignited my passion again for taking on the food industry. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1057.6200000000001s)]
*  And I'm so happy for it because I think this is our time. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1064.6200000000001s)]
*  This is a new age. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1068.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, the movement is literally unstoppable. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1070.1000000000001s)]
*  We are all coming together. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1072.78s)]
*  It's a bipartisan issue now where you see in California, they just banned artificial [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1074.66s)]
*  food dyes in schools. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1080.78s)]
*  It was unanimous decision. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1082.06s)]
*  All Democrats, all Republicans coming together. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1083.42s)]
*  You see in the Bernie Sanders hearing where he questioned the FDA, Senator Tupperville [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1085.9s)]
*  coming at Red 3 so hard like it took everybody. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1092.5s)]
*  Most conservatives, liberal. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1096.3s)]
*  Right. I mean, just coming together to take on these issues, to get it done. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1097.3799999999999s)]
*  And it's because we're all working together. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1102.42s)]
*  And it's amazing what can happen when we do that. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1104.9s)]
*  To get political for a second, I think it is political malpractice. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1106.98s)]
*  The left gave up the issue of protecting kids. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1109.94s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's just wild that they'd let this issue be a jump ball. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1114.1000000000001s)]
*  And it really is. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1118.3400000000001s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1119.3400000000001s)]
*  I think it's Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1120.8200000000002s)]
*  Honestly, I don't think so. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1123.6200000000001s)]
*  I think you're being very kind here. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1126.14s)]
*  The deification of the experts during covid because Trump was not for the experts and [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1128.26s)]
*  the deification of Fauci has led the left for a completely. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1134.18s)]
*  You never would have predicted this 10 years ago to be the party of ultra processed food [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1139.18s)]
*  and be the party of pharmaceuticals. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1142.98s)]
*  And what was so striking to me two years ago is like some of the most resonant podcasts [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1145.38s)]
*  you were doing, Joe Rogan, you know, I hear he's some kind of misinformation crazy person. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1150.46s)]
*  I listened to him during covid. He's talking about being healthy. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1155.5400000000002s)]
*  He's talking about metabolic health. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1157.74s)]
*  The top books in the country, you know, everyone's listening to Jillian following Vani. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1159.38s)]
*  It's like there was this when Americans were left their own devices, when there was [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1163.3400000000001s)]
*  independent press and independent media, not the corporate control media, which is [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1166.94s)]
*  50 percent funded by pharma. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1170.02s)]
*  Americans are flocking to how can I get healthier? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1171.78s)]
*  How can my kids get healthier? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1174.38s)]
*  But it wasn't being talked about on the political stage by the two major parties. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1175.46s)]
*  Then Bobby Kennedy comes and was getting 20 percent of the vote. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1178.94s)]
*  This person who wasn't allowed on mainstream media was said is totally crazy. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1181.74s)]
*  So there was this. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1185.66s)]
*  It's like the Democrats have allowed themselves to become the party of expertise, even when [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1186.46s)]
*  those experts have proven themselves to be corrupt. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1190.22s)]
*  And I don't even want to. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1192.66s)]
*  That's the key word corrupt. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1193.78s)]
*  It's a money game. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1196.22s)]
*  So when you're taking money, massive campaign donations from big food, big pharma, big insurance, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1197.6200000000001s)]
*  big ag, of course, you're going to toe that line without question. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1203.06s)]
*  I guess I want to push back on that just for a second, because they both take both parties [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1208.02s)]
*  take money from big pharma and big ag. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1212.82s)]
*  We were looking on open secret in preparation for this conversation. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1215.22s)]
*  If you look at 2023 and 2024, packs created by massive food and beverage players, Coca-Cola, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1218.82s)]
*  I know you want to jump in, Callie. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1226.14s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1227.14s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1228.14s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1229.14s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1230.14s)]
*  I have a bottle of this. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1231.14s)]
*  All of it. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1232.14s)]
*  They donated more to Republicans than to Democrats. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1233.14s)]
*  Well, I was just going to jump in and say, please don't bring facts into our arguments [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1235.14s)]
*  here. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1239.14s)]
*  We're trying to make. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1240.14s)]
*  This is a vibe conversation. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1241.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1242.14s)]
*  No, but I'm just saying, if you're like, if the story is really money corrupts and we [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1243.14s)]
*  got to follow the money, the money flows in both directions toward both parties. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1247.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, but did it flow to Bobby Kennedy? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1251.42s)]
*  Did they pay off Bobby Kennedy? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1253.74s)]
*  Because Callie worked with Bobby to put a spotlight on this issue. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1255.94s)]
*  And then Trump, being intelligent as hell, realized that this was going to be a matter [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1260.66s)]
*  of capturing those people in the middle, grabbed Bobby and said, I'm willing to do this. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1266.56s)]
*  He's also a billionaire. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1270.78s)]
*  This is his last term. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1272.18s)]
*  He's not beholden to these big companies. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1274.02s)]
*  I mean, he's a dealmaker. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1276.14s)]
*  That's obvious. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1277.54s)]
*  And I'm sure he's going to negotiate ways for everybody to coexist. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1278.54s)]
*  Nevertheless, I'm pretty confident that Bobby didn't take money from these people. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1282.74s)]
*  Trump saw an opportunity to capture all of us and bring us into the fold. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1287.78s)]
*  And then to everybody else, it's like, OK, well, are you in or are you out? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1291.82s)]
*  Oh, no, pure strategy. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1295.54s)]
*  What Trump did is amazing. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1297.1s)]
*  But we all know that his body is 99 percent composed of Big Macs. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1298.26s)]
*  So what does it mean? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1301.6200000000001s)]
*  But is he beholden to McDonald's financially? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1303.6200000000001s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1306.74s)]
*  We had a unique situation with the president. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1308.74s)]
*  The health had to be a presidential level opportunity. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1312.02s)]
*  And I think, you know, when looking at Donald Trump, I don't think there's been a candidate [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1315.78s)]
*  in our lifetimes that's been less beholden to special interests. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1319.54s)]
*  I mean, I think he raised four times less money than Kamala. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1322.38s)]
*  It's been all earned media. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1325.66s)]
*  So you do you certainly have a president here who's willing to tell special interests, particularly [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1327.22s)]
*  pharma, which, you know, totally screwed him last time. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1331.34s)]
*  And he had no love for. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1335.24s)]
*  You know, he's willing to listen to everybody, but tell them to screw off when you get to [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1336.66s)]
*  you to agree that it's strange bedfellows to like when you see the picture of Bobby [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1341.02s)]
*  Kennedy, I think being hazed on Air Force One and being forced to like down those seed [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1344.86s)]
*  oil fries, you're just like, this is weird. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1349.82s)]
*  I got to push back. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1352.22s)]
*  I really do believe this. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1353.22s)]
*  I've got this a lot. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1354.34s)]
*  Yes, by the way, I love those fries. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1355.7s)]
*  You know, like, no, I know, I know. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1357.94s)]
*  Jilly is horrified. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1359.46s)]
*  Jilly is so horrified by me. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1360.34s)]
*  So yes, Donald Trump. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1361.62s)]
*  You're going to intervention on me. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1364.3s)]
*  I welcome. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1366.1s)]
*  He eats Big Macs, but the health issue and I think what they so effectively framed, it's [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1367.54s)]
*  not about lecturing people what to eat. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1373.1s)]
*  It's a matter of corruption. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1375.1s)]
*  And I do think viscerally, President Trump felt connected to how Bobby brought him along [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1376.26s)]
*  on this issue about the corruption that is impacting kids. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1382.86s)]
*  I mean, take the USDA nutrition guidelines. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1386.4599999999998s)]
*  Nineteen out of 20 people who make our guidelines for our kids are paid for by the food [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1389.78s)]
*  or farm industry. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1393.5s)]
*  President Biden put a 400 page document together that said ultra processed food is healthy [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1394.74s)]
*  for kids that says two year old skinny dad and sugar. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1398.7s)]
*  That's being plopped on Trump's desk. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1400.78s)]
*  You know, we just have rank corruption. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1402.62s)]
*  So although President Trump might enjoy Big Mac once in a while, he the foundation of [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1404.82s)]
*  his candidacy is taking on corruption. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1409.02s)]
*  And I think that's where they connected. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1411.26s)]
*  And I think when President Trump, I mean, the rally with Bobby, when Bobby came out [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1412.66s)]
*  and endorsed him and President Trump said very emotionally, we're going to figure out [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1417.26s)]
*  why kids are getting so sick and take on the corruption of the FDA, CDC and NIH. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1420.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, he meant that with all of his heart and there was an eruption from the crowd. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1424.54s)]
*  So I do agree. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1427.78s)]
*  And I think we've got to separate that, his personal habits and the question. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1428.9399999999998s)]
*  No one's trying to take away McDonald's french fries. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1432.9399999999998s)]
*  Like, that's not the purpose of the Maha movement. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1435.82s)]
*  McDonald's french fries in the UK only have three ingredients. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1438.3799999999999s)]
*  OK, and salt is optional. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1442.6599999999999s)]
*  So that's it. So why? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1444.2199999999998s)]
*  OK, why? Yeah, because corruption money, like money. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1446.7399999999998s)]
*  No, but why? Why are the like money? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1450.3799999999999s)]
*  Steel man the other side for me. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1453.82s)]
*  Why is it in the interest of McDonald's America to have? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1455.6599999999999s)]
*  I know that you guys know this chapter in verse to have so many of these ingredients. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1459.82s)]
*  Like shelf life, palatability equals margin. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1463.8999999999999s)]
*  Period. And I'll let you speak to the serial conversation. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1467.6599999999999s)]
*  Why is it glow in the dark, Bonnie? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1471.78s)]
*  Well, I mean, I mean, so in focus groups, they found out that children eat more of that [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1474.06s)]
*  product than the lesser bright version. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1479.42s)]
*  Right. So this is from a when we think the obesity epidemic, when we think about the fact [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1482.78s)]
*  that we're they're all getting diabetes, pre-diabetes, we need to step in here. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1487.54s)]
*  I mean, how do we stand a chance if PepsiCo [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1492.1000000000001s)]
*  has a robot that mimics human taste buds in engineering our food [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1496.7s)]
*  so that we cannot stop eating it? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1502.5s)]
*  How does the human population stand a chance against that? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1504.42s)]
*  Right. Unless we step in and do something from a regulation standpoint or from a just [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1508.86s)]
*  from a fairness standpoint to our human health. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1512.9799999999998s)]
*  And, you know, we look at these ingredients that remain in our food supply and how there's [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1515.62s)]
*  over 10000 here in the United States, where only like there's close to 400 approved in Europe. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1521.3s)]
*  We see the stark differences and we see how our government has allowed this loophole [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1525.4199999999998s)]
*  to continue where food companies approve the chemicals themselves, create the chemicals [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1530.4599999999998s)]
*  to improve their bottom line. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1534.62s)]
*  And then they end up in our food supply because it makes them more money. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1536.1s)]
*  And when you look at nutrition labels and you look at ingredient labels and you see all [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1538.86s)]
*  of those chemical names, they're not there for nutritional purpose. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1543.94s)]
*  And this is one of the most fundamental things the human, you know, every human should know [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1547.74s)]
*  is that if you don't recognize an ingredient and you don't see it as something you would find [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1553.7s)]
*  in nature, it's not there to improve nutrition. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1557.5s)]
*  It's there to improve the bottom line of the food industry. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1560.46s)]
*  And when you opt out of that science experiment, you start to realize a level of health that you [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1563.1s)]
*  never thought was possible and you start to get off all the pharmaceuticals. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1567.74s)]
*  You start to lose the weight. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1571.1399999999999s)]
*  You start to to to feel better in a way that is incredible. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1572.26s)]
*  And that's where you find your brain start working again and then you find your calling and [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1576.46s)]
*  you're not depressed anymore and you're doing what you're supposed to be doing in this world. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1579.98s)]
*  I like want what you're having. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1583.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm like, well, I think this is what Bonnie's talking about. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1585.1799999999998s)]
*  I think I think we hit that vein in the campaign. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1588.58s)]
*  There's really a spiritual issue here. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1591.74s)]
*  We're really like we're really, I think, really tapping human capital down in the country [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1593.18s)]
*  because of this. You know, just to add on to what your question of why is because drugs are a good [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1598.1s)]
*  business model. I always go to the fact and what Casey and I try to do is just go to the facts like [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1602.98s)]
*  let's not get into this conspiracy. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1607.94s)]
*  The fact of the matter is the cigarette industry bought up the ultra processed food industry in [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1609.14s)]
*  the 1990s and 50 percent of the US food supply was from Philip Morris and R.J. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1613.42s)]
*  Reynolds. They bought up when the smoking rates went down, they had massive balance sheets and [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1616.94s)]
*  the two largest M&A deals in world history up until 1990 were cigarette companies buying food companies. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1621.7s)]
*  And they strategically moved hundreds of thousands of scientists from the cigarette department to the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1626.66s)]
*  food department. And then they moved their lobbyist over and lobbied for the food pyramid, which was [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1632.42s)]
*  an ultra processed food marketing document. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1636.42s)]
*  As you know, we listen to scientific experts. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1638.02s)]
*  And when the food pyramid came out, we shifted our consumption from fats, healthy fats and things [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1640.8600000000001s)]
*  like that to carbs. 20 percent, 20 percent carb increase in the US diet 10 years after the food pyramid. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1646.26s)]
*  So that was an ultra processed food marketing document. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1651.3s)]
*  Now, 70 percent of a child's diet is ultra processed food. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1653.14s)]
*  Why does that matter? Because ultra processed food is a science experiment from scientists that work for the [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1656.06s)]
*  tobacco industry to make that food ultra palatable. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1662.34s)]
*  So we have this epidemic where you go to a playground with my three year old and right, there's there's just [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1665.1000000000001s)]
*  kids littered with with ultra processed food, with all this garbage. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1669.46s)]
*  They're drinking soda. And then what's happening? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1672.78s)]
*  The medical community is saying that we need to be giving six year olds a zympic. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1675.5s)]
*  Right. And they're saying that not wait and see the guidance of the American Academy of Pediatrics is that we [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1680.34s)]
*  should not wait for dietary interventions. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1687.34s)]
*  We should jam that six year old with a zympic for the rest of their life at a cost of six hundred dollars per month [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1689.02s)]
*  forever from the taxpayer. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1694.6200000000001s)]
*  So so that's kind of the example of this way we've lost our way. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1696.38s)]
*  It's a massive we're not going to ozimic our way and jab our way and pill our way into better human capital, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1700.26s)]
*  better mental health. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1706.42s)]
*  So there's this vicious circle that I think has been tapped into. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1708.46s)]
*  Without question. And if you look at their relationship or even if I could put on a tin hat for just a moment. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1712.02s)]
*  Oh, go ahead. Look at which companies own the controlling share of the big ag companies. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1717.8999999999999s)]
*  They happen to be the same companies that own the controlling share of big food companies and the big pharma [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1725.22s)]
*  companies and the big insurance companies. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1733.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's all about money. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1737.86s)]
*  There's definitely a closed loop here. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1740.22s)]
*  I scratch your back. You scratch mine. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1743.1399999999999s)]
*  It begins with big ag. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1745.02s)]
*  We make poisonous cheap crappy calories. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1746.26s)]
*  Big food picks it up with our team of multidisciplinary scientists to make it last forever on the shelf. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1749.1799999999998s)]
*  Like that's why in that episode of Walking Dead, food is still on the shelf five years later when they're [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1754.6599999999999s)]
*  rummaging through a friggin convenience store. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1760.26s)]
*  I mean, and it's designed to be highly palatable. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1762.78s)]
*  So you become addicted and you eat more. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1765.3400000000001s)]
*  And then there's big pharma like amazing. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1767.5800000000002s)]
*  Everyone's sick. Let's get you on 12 medications by the time you're 50. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1769.42s)]
*  And then there's big insurance to capitalize on it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1773.14s)]
*  And it just continues. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1775.7800000000002s)]
*  And unfortunately, it is all politics and they are allowed, enabled. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1777.3000000000002s)]
*  It's facilitated with the way private industry has a revolving door with our government health agencies. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1782.38s)]
*  And Callie speaks to that better than anyone. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1790.14s)]
*  Well, and I just say on the on the political front, I do really think President Trump saw the political opportunity. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1791.86s)]
*  He's the only politician in America that's accountable to everyone kind of by design and tapped in this and believes in it. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1796.54s)]
*  I think the problem is, and there is a big problem in the Senate. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1802.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's five pharma lobbies for every senator and member of Congress. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1805.02s)]
*  The pharmaceutical industry alone and the insurance industry, the health care industry combined, spends five times more on [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1810.6599999999999s)]
*  political donations than any other industry. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1816.26s)]
*  So I do think you're seeing and you're going to see this. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1818.3799999999999s)]
*  Who are your big hopes in the Senate? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1820.34s)]
*  Who are you pinning your hopes on? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1822.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you're you're definitely seeing already the we're very confident in the confirmation for Bobby. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1823.86s)]
*  But you're definitely you know, I'm just I've seen I've seen it. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1830.3s)]
*  The senators go into that office. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1834.02s)]
*  They've completely bankrolled a lot. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1835.54s)]
*  The lobbyists, they've been girl, these senators, and they're looking for ways to cut away at Bobby. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1837.58s)]
*  I mean, the pro-life groups that are attacking Bobby and abortion are funded by Pharma. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1842.02s)]
*  Mike Pence's group is actually there's evidence I've seen that they're they're they're somewhat funded by Pharma. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1846.8200000000002s)]
*  Mike Pence has been heavily funded by Pharma, and now he's using the abortion. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1852.7s)]
*  They're they're going to use any possible angle. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1855.9s)]
*  And I'll tell you, being in some of these meetings and seeing some of the arguments from the other stakeholders, they go into that [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1858.54s)]
*  office and they do not debate the fact that kids are getting sick and it's their products profiting and making the kids sick. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1864.46s)]
*  They are arguing to the senators that's going to cost jobs. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1869.98s)]
*  They don't even debate the health argument. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1872.54s)]
*  They've completely conceded that they've completely conceded that we're the sickest country in the world. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1875.62s)]
*  They've completely conceded that there are food in the United States is less healthy than the same product for every other country. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1879.4599999999998s)]
*  They've conceded the pharmaceutical industry that they fundamentally profit from people being sick. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1885.22s)]
*  They don't reverse disease. They only manage it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1888.8999999999999s)]
*  They're not debating what Bobby's saying. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1891.02s)]
*  They're only making the economic argument and looking for any type of wedge. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1892.4599999999998s)]
*  So so Bobby's going to get through. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1896.82s)]
*  But I think that's something we need to understand and why it's so important to empower President Trump in this. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1898.4599999999998s)]
*  The presidency is designed to actually combat the narrow interests of the Senate and Congress, who are absolutely bought off just by [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1902.18s)]
*  definition by the pharmaceutical industry. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1909.1000000000001s)]
*  So I do think we just have to actually really, I believe, just support President Trump in this mission. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1910.8600000000001s)]
*  Who am I? Who am I helpful for? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1917.98s)]
*  I think a lot of Republicans have woken up. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1920.6200000000001s)]
*  Tuberville. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1923.1000000000001s)]
*  Listen, who are your allies? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1923.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, Roger Marshall, who's a doctor, who's been, you know, very traditional thinking has talked about. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1926.94s)]
*  Being super impacted by Maha and started the Maha caucus. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1932.06s)]
*  Tommy Tuberville has been a conservative. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1935.94s)]
*  The most one of the most conservative members is taking on food dyes. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1937.62s)]
*  He's saying the exact same thing Bernie Sanders and Gavin Newsom is saying. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1939.98s)]
*  I mean, you've got Senator Cory Booker and then you've got Democrats. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1943.34s)]
*  You've got Cory Booker. You've got Bernie Sanders. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1948.62s)]
*  I think are going to be. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1952.1s)]
*  Do you see this as an issue where there can be genuine bipartisan cooperation? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1952.62s)]
*  There's a lot of Democrats that strongly, strongly support what Bobby Kennedy is saying. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1956.1399999999999s)]
*  100 percent. I mean, even when you take vaccines, let's go. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1961.1399999999999s)]
*  It's great. It's great. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1965.6599999999999s)]
*  Vaccines are great. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1967.1s)]
*  Two largest vaccine makers in the world are by definition, just as a demonstrable statement of fact, criminal enterprises. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1967.82s)]
*  GlaxoSmith, Klayman, Merck have settled over five billion dollars in criminal penalties for falsifying research and bribing doctors in the past five years. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1974.54s)]
*  These are vaccine makers. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1982.74s)]
*  So we can. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1983.74s)]
*  I cannot fact check you on stage. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1984.86s)]
*  OK, well, but let's talk about the like the bigger gestalt issue. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1986.74s)]
*  I think a lot of people are drawn to the maha movement and frankly drawn to Bobby Kennedy because they think our kids are sick. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1991.3799999999999s)]
*  We are fat. We are sedentary. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=1998.1s)]
*  Something's going wrong. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2000.06s)]
*  If you look at pictures of beaches, there's these these memes, you know, of an American beach in Los Angeles or Malibu or whatever from the 60s or 70s. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2001.26s)]
*  Everyone looks svelte and amazing. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2010.7s)]
*  Take that same picture. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2012.58s)]
*  Now it's wildly different. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2013.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2014.82s)]
*  Common sense says something has gone awry and we should do something about it. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2015.22s)]
*  Where I think people start to look at things a little bit more skeptically is around the issue of vaccines and around the issue of skepticism around vaccines. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2019.1399999999999s)]
*  Because if you just look again, common sense of the numbers, we live in it, we live in a country where there's no polio. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2029.78s)]
*  We live in a country where there's no measles. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2035.86s)]
*  And these innovations have been essential, life saving, especially for children. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2037.6599999999999s)]
*  Square for me, like contend with that issue for me. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2043.38s)]
*  I'm sure you've gotten this question many times before. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2045.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's 72 interventions for a kid. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2048.14s)]
*  Right. So there's there's 12 different things. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2051.3s)]
*  So what Bobby Kennedy is saying, if you ask the country, you know, do you support vaccines? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2054.5s)]
*  Majority would probably say yes to those polls. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2059.3s)]
*  If you ask the country, should criminal enterprises be continually subjected to science to make sure they're telling the truth when there's an incentive for them to get their products on a schedule to be mandated for every single American? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2060.78s)]
*  We should continue to subject those pharmaceutical products to science and continue to study them and continue to have transparency. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2071.1s)]
*  Then 90 percent of people would say yes. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2076.02s)]
*  If you actually decipher what Bobby Kennedy has said about vaccines, as just a demodular statement, he is saying that they should be subjected to science. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2077.62s)]
*  He is saying pharmaceutical products should be subject to science. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2083.58s)]
*  President Trump has declared his intention to investigate why kids are getting sick as we're all talking about. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2086.3s)]
*  And so what Casey talks about so eloquently, there's a multifactorial pillars of why we're getting sick, we think. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2091.54s)]
*  That's food, that sedentary lifestyle, that's chronic stress, that's circadian rhythm and sleep. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2097.6600000000003s)]
*  And absolutely it's over prescription pharmaceuticals. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2101.26s)]
*  It's the fact that we're on four point six billion prescriptions a year. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2104.1400000000003s)]
*  And it might be the fact we've even taken what you just said, the fact that we've dramatically increased and there's a massive incentive for criminal enterprises, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2107.3s)]
*  GlaxoSmithKline and Merck to get more and more and more vaccines on the schedule. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2115.7400000000002s)]
*  You cannot watch an NFL game without seeing ad after ad after ad for new vaccines with the companies. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2119.1s)]
*  And I know not out of goodwill or desire for children's health, they are jamming these things onto the schedule so that the second they're on the schedule, the media, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2124.98s)]
*  the corporate media that is 50 percent funded by the pharmaceutical industry calls anyone a war criminal. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2133.7s)]
*  There are studies that literally have a three day window of of of of complications. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2138.5s)]
*  The studies just foundationally are not. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2144.8999999999996s)]
*  But the second you have a study, you have the media shut down, anyone who even asks a question. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2147.02s)]
*  So so I do think the vaccine debate represents to me. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2150.7799999999997s)]
*  And I think we can get beyond this religious issue of the blanket immunity and blanket nonquestioning 72 shots to actually talk about and be adults in this country, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2154.5s)]
*  not be infantilized, where we can actually continue to object every pharmaceutical product to science. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2163.1s)]
*  I'll just say the last point that the FDA, I'm going to back you up at the FDA. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2168.18s)]
*  I'm just saying, just just taking getting out of pharmaceuticals, just drugs, 50 percent of FDA approvals for drugs. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2171.58s)]
*  That study cannot be replicated. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2177.98s)]
*  The study cannot be replicated for the drug system that we have right now. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2179.46s)]
*  Like like the science of pharmaceutical products is totally shoddy. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2182.74s)]
*  So this is a wider issue that I think we can have as adults about subjecting the pharmaceutical industry to continued rigor and science. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2186.58s)]
*  There would be no reason not to. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2195.18s)]
*  So that is what Bobby's saying. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2196.34s)]
*  Billy, go ahead. OK, so first, I just want to take one step back and say so much of the things that Callie and Vani are bringing up are illegal in most of the developed world. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2197.98s)]
*  You're not allowed to have pharmaceutical advertisements on TV, I think, with the exception of New Zealand. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2207.98s)]
*  Right. That's that's about it for a reason, because they're buying the narrative. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2212.62s)]
*  The ways that they lobby and essentially buy off the politicians also illegal in most other countries of the developed world, if not all, I think. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2216.58s)]
*  So that should be your first indication that there is an issue here. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2225.34s)]
*  Now, with that said, let's look at how we got to 72 shots and what actually are they? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2229.34s)]
*  Well, in 1986, the Reagan administration granted the pharmaceutical company's blanket immunity and subsequently you got that many more doses of vaccines on the schedule because there are no downstream consequences. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2235.06s)]
*  Now, ask yourself this. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2250.3s)]
*  Let's look at hepatitis B. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2252.1s)]
*  Nobody's arguing about polio and measles right now. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2254.2999999999997s)]
*  I am not a PhD. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2256.54s)]
*  I strongly suggest you speak to some who could make a far more educated case on the science. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2257.9s)]
*  That said, I'm vaccinated. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2262.74s)]
*  My kids are vaccinated. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2264.8199999999997s)]
*  Hepatitis B. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2265.94s)]
*  Wish we didn't have to do that one. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2266.94s)]
*  What is it? Well, it's a sexually transmitted disease that you get from risky unprotected sex and needles. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2268.8199999999997s)]
*  Does a newborn need that on their second day of life? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2274.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, mom could have it. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2277.66s)]
*  Well, can you test the mother? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2278.74s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2280.22s)]
*  So then why are you giving it to my kid outside of the fact that it's a billion dollar business for you now? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2281.58s)]
*  And it's not given in Japan and many countries in Europe. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2287.38s)]
*  So we can't question that. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2289.66s)]
*  Right. Or 18 of those shots are COVID shots. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2290.58s)]
*  We know kids don't need a COVID shot. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2293.5s)]
*  That's mandated now for six-month-olds. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2295.5s)]
*  This is what we're talking about. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2297.8199999999997s)]
*  And I think there's a wide milieu and I think there's many areas Bobby can focus on. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2299.86s)]
*  But if you're going to ask about it, I do think there's this Pandora's box with the vaccine debate. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2306.34s)]
*  And I think it represents a lot of what you're seeing, you know, and what we've seen with censorship in general. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2311.02s)]
*  Why can't why are parents war criminals for asking questions about immune system taging shots they're giving their kids? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2315.34s)]
*  Why is the media and all these corrupt, rancid government organizations bashing others? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2321.7s)]
*  I'm not corrupt and rancid. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2326.94s)]
*  And I'm saying there is a world of difference between talking about the Hep B vaccine and reviving arguments, let's say, that vaccines cause autism. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2328.14s)]
*  Or do you see? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2339.82s)]
*  What causes autism? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2341.86s)]
*  I was going to say this is highly debatable and this is where you need qualified MDs and PhDs to have this conversation with you. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2343.3s)]
*  But let's go back to happen to exactly. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2350.5400000000004s)]
*  Doc, I was like, you want to jump in here? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2353.34s)]
*  He does not want to jump in here. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2355.38s)]
*  With that said, let's just look at Hep B for one more moment. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2356.7000000000003s)]
*  When I was asking, like, what is the robust data they're doing on these vaccines? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2360.9s)]
*  Let me look into it myself. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2365.1000000000004s)]
*  You can do this on your own right now. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2366.46s)]
*  You go to the FDA's website for vaccines licensed for use in America. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2368.06s)]
*  Great. Go to recombivax HB. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2373.06s)]
*  That's one of the Hep B vaccines. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2376.06s)]
*  You go into like package insert, check section six point one, and it will tell you exactly what Kelly just said. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2378.02s)]
*  I think it was like four hundred and thirty four doses to one hundred and forty something kids. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2384.14s)]
*  And they monitored them after injection for five days. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2389.2599999999998s)]
*  Now, do they go back and see if the antibodies there and if it's still efficacious? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2392.18s)]
*  Sure. Is that robust to you? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2396.18s)]
*  By the way, there's no placebo group. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2399.5s)]
*  Do we know what's creating the rise in autism? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2401.74s)]
*  No, there are so many different things wrong from crap in the air, crap in the food, all the pharmaceuticals. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2404.8199999999997s)]
*  But it definitely is a question. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2411.58s)]
*  And I have believe me, I worked on a show called The Doctors and all those doctors back in the day were like, this is nonsense. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2414.8599999999997s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2421.2999999999997s)]
*  And then subsequently began to speak to people on the side who have suggested that hitting kids with all of these things so early into life is certainly not optimal. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2422.42s)]
*  But what would a message what would a message sound like to the public? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2433.2200000000003s)]
*  Right. We need to. Yeah, go ahead. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2437.1s)]
*  President Trump is going to figure out why kids are getting sick. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2438.94s)]
*  There is the callousness from the media and medical elites about just like dismissing questions about autism. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2441.86s)]
*  We don't know what causes autism. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2447.58s)]
*  No, we don't. And President Trump has said we are going to study. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2448.7400000000002s)]
*  Now, this is very we got a microbiome expert here, one of the top hero of the movement who can speak to this much better, probably doesn't want to right now. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2451.86s)]
*  But but but my high level common sense is that there is a lot of research showing that autism is tied to the microbiome and gut dysfunction. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2463.1400000000003s)]
*  And we have an all out nuclear war right now in our child's microbiomes with the pesticides, with the fact that there's so much artificial light. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2471.6600000000003s)]
*  Their phones actually very much disrupts your hormones. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2479.34s)]
*  And yes, with the overpollination proliferation of pharmaceuticals, which absolutely have a massive impact on the microbiome. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2483.7000000000003s)]
*  So to say that this complex complex milieu of issues that are impacting our child's gut, you know, to take anything off the table there is scientifically flagrantly and accurate. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2489.1800000000003s)]
*  And the message and the message that I think really has resonated. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2502.0600000000004s)]
*  And I do think vaccines are a topic and is worth talking about. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2505.38s)]
*  But it's one for me, one factor of many others that are impacting our metabolic health is that why can't we ask questions? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2508.5s)]
*  And what President Trump and I think the great spirit and great opportunity of Maha is figuring out what the hell is going on right now. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2514.3s)]
*  Fifty percent of sorry, 80 percent of the NIH goes to pharmaceutical R&D. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2521.6600000000003s)]
*  We're going to unbundle that and get to just asking the taboo. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2525.38s)]
*  We should be asking the taboo questions. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2528.6200000000003s)]
*  So we've been talking about food. We've been talking about pharma. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2530.02s)]
*  What are the other pillars of the MAGA? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2533.26s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. The Maha movement environments like like what are the other key priorities that you think this administration should be talking about and tackling in the first hundred days? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2536.34s)]
*  Bonnie. Yeah, I mean, we have a problem with microplastics in our food. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2546.3s)]
*  You know, we have a credit card size shape of plastics in our bodies right now. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2551.26s)]
*  It's insane. And and when we look at those forever chemicals that are in our body and how they affect our rising rates of cancer and disease, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2556.1s)]
*  I mean, that is a fundamental issue in terms of the mass poisoning of our bodies and what we can do there. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2564.1s)]
*  And so that is an issue I know that needs to be addressed and and and handled. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2569.5s)]
*  You know, I also think there there's this overwhelming sense that we need transparency and we need truth. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2576.06s)]
*  To come out. And, you know, I think a lot about what's happening when this movement, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2585.9s)]
*  how we're able to educate people about these topics in a new way that's never been done. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2592.7000000000003s)]
*  Now, the mainstream media is coming alive and wanting to talk about these issues and have a voice like mine back on, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2597.3s)]
*  which I was for so many years censored, you know, and you too. Right. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2607.02s)]
*  I got kicked off a tick tock for one reel about a doctor talking about ivermectin [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2611.98s)]
*  and a hypothesis as to why it might mitigate the severity of your covid case. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2617.7400000000002s)]
*  It's bananas what has happened. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2622.94s)]
*  And I think that's that's the piece of the censorship and in the lack of transparency about our drugs, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2625.14s)]
*  about the vaccines, about our food that has driven everyone to kind of come together and say we've had enough. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2631.94s)]
*  We want truth. We want transparency and and we want to be able to educate people in a way that isn't being funded by big industry. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2638.34s)]
*  Right. And so this is why the free press is so beautiful. Right. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2646.38s)]
*  And and yes, yes. That's it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2650.3s)]
*  God, I am the big pharma to her. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2653.7000000000003s)]
*  OK, let's take a step back for a second. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2661.82s)]
*  The the actual things that you like. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2665.7s)]
*  OK, here maybe I'll put it this way. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2669.2999999999997s)]
*  I feel like you, Jillian Michaels, have spent your entire career trying to sort of sway culture toward these conclusions. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2671.54s)]
*  Maybe you weren't talking about red dye or microplastics. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2679.1s)]
*  But I talked about it in a book 15 years ago. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2681.8999999999996s)]
*  But even organic didn't. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2683.8599999999997s)]
*  But being. Yes. Right. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2685.46s)]
*  And so then there's the beginning. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2687.3399999999997s)]
*  There's cultural suasion and influence, which is you guys have really been in the business of that. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2688.7s)]
*  And then there's like the strong arm of government where like and generally conservatives don't love Kali, the strong arm of government. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2693.54s)]
*  Like where's the line? Like where are the places where the government should be banning, interceding, outlying? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2703.02s)]
*  Like, give us give us not a lot of bands. Not a lot of bands to start. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2709.42s)]
*  The two the two pillars of Maha are stop recommending poisonous crap and stop subsidizing it. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2712.38s)]
*  So let's just take pharmaceutical products. Right. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2718.94s)]
*  So like I should be able to buy Fruit Loop. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2720.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They shouldn't be subsidized. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2722.7s)]
*  Well, we have grasses getting into the weeds there. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2724.14s)]
*  We have grass standards with the FDA where we don't get into the FDA recently said that they actually don't know all the chemicals in our food. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2727.18s)]
*  We actually have a situation where it's self-policing. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2733.78s)]
*  So we actually don't even know what are in the fruit loops. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2737.1s)]
*  They don't even have to label them in the United States. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2739.06s)]
*  We have full capture. Just the ingredient. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2740.7s)]
*  Just sorry. I just aside note. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2742.9s)]
*  Just the ingredient natural flavor. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2744.26s)]
*  When you see that on a label, it can mean up to a thousand different chemicals. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2745.98s)]
*  And those are the chemicals that are engineering your brain to like that flavor and create that addictive flavor. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2749.98s)]
*  Right. So it's a complete lack of transparency about what's really happening to our food. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2754.02s)]
*  Go ahead. So let's get to your point about the nanny state and conservatives embracing this. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2758.42s)]
*  So when I was a lobbyist, like 15, like you get where I'm going. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2762.5s)]
*  I totally get where you're going. It's a it's what I'm most passionate about describing. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2765.18s)]
*  And I think conservatives have really learned this. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2768.58s)]
*  Fixing the free market, correcting corruption, addressing corruption is not an attack on the free market. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2770.9s)]
*  It is an imperative for the free market. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2777.38s)]
*  When I was a lobbyist 15 years ago, we used to go and pay conservative think tanks to say that it was nanny state to take soda off of food stamps. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2779.78s)]
*  But the soda companies are lobbying tens of millions of dollars to get the soda on food stamps. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2788.54s)]
*  So actually saying, should the government be funding diabetes water to addict kids to and then give them a diabetes to where Medicaid right now for lower income kids is more expensive than the entire defense intelligence budget and growing two times faster. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2792.2200000000003s)]
*  Is that saying conservative federal policy? No, it's not. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2805.02s)]
*  Actually, it's an imperative for the free market to say we're not going to poison our children with supplemental nutrition programs. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2807.5s)]
*  So so that's the framework. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2813.46s)]
*  When we talk about the biggest elephant in the room, which is our four point five trillion dollar health care budget, that is dictated by the American Medical Association, which is by definition a pharmaceutical lobbying group that has the judgment to have no age limit right now for gender transition surgery. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2815.46s)]
*  That is the that is the group that we have outsourced 20 percent of the U.S. economy to whenever anyone in this room goes to a doctor, they are subject to the American Medical Association algorithms which underpin Medicare, Medicaid through totally administratively decision. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2830.86s)]
*  Like we just thrown it out to them and then all private insurance. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2845.2200000000003s)]
*  So what Bobby and Trump are saying is it's actually imperative. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2847.94s)]
*  It's paired for free market. It's imperative for human capital that we take our medical logic away from this top down system. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2851.9s)]
*  It's a top down system and give people choice. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2858.7s)]
*  I mean, this idea of medical freedom and this idea of patients working with their doctors on their complex interpersonal issue and then working with that doctor to figure out a solution for them. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2861.66s)]
*  That's not going to be a zimpic for every six year old. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2872.02s)]
*  That should be using the medical dollars for what Chris Palmer talks about of food or supplementation or incentivizing exercise. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2874.58s)]
*  You know, in Europe, in Denmark, if you're obese, you do not get a zimpic. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2882.3399999999997s)]
*  They're making 90 percent of their profits. Their biggest company from the United States. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2887.5s)]
*  You get an insurance subsidized keto diet. You get insurance subsidized exercise. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2890.74s)]
*  Maybe it was Zimpic if you're old and morbidly obese and diabetic. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2895.78s)]
*  Maybe. But like that's not the first line of defense. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2899.14s)]
*  It's more flexible. So that's the public policy imperative for mahi. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2901.18s)]
*  It's two parts. Let's get Americans the truth so they can make informed consent. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2904.46s)]
*  We do not have the truth right now. We do not have full information and then free up flexibility. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2908.5s)]
*  Get out of the stranglehold of the American Medical Association codes and allow patients to have flexibility with their doctor. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2913.18s)]
*  And I think the only way to get to the truth is what Gillian said, which is we have to get the pharmaceutical funding out of the media. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2919.18s)]
*  And no one's trying to ban. So should Pfizer not be allowed to buy ads on CNN? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2925.58s)]
*  Exactly. But they will be arguably. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2930.3399999999997s)]
*  Kathleen, I've had a conversation about this recently because of the First Amendment. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2932.94s)]
*  You kind of don't want to mess with that. So it's very sticky. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2936.2999999999997s)]
*  With that said, what would be banned? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2939.5s)]
*  Well, let's look at the argument that Vani has put front and center with regard to sugar cereal. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2942.42s)]
*  What if it was just sugar and not high fructose corn syrup from genetically engineered crops that are sprayed with a million different chemicals? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2948.2200000000003s)]
*  What if she could just do that for you with your fruit loops to make it that much easier for the average American not to have to worry about their toxic load? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2955.9s)]
*  That's the kind of stuff that people, correct me if I'm wrong, that Vani is trying to facilitate. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2965.3s)]
*  So it's not about taking your cereal away. It's about making it significantly less poisonous. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2970.02s)]
*  I, of course, would love for you to have eggs, as I think we all would at the table. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2974.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's the conversation. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2977.94s)]
*  What I find even more interesting is we're so worried about everybody banning McDonald's, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2979.54s)]
*  but we don't want to give moms a choice about the hepatitis B vaccine for their newborn. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2982.6600000000003s)]
*  Just saying. And I do think not to circle back, but I can't help myself. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2986.6600000000003s)]
*  That vaccine conversation is a bit of a red herring to distract you. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2990.94s)]
*  Kennedy has never said he's taking away your measles vaccine. That's not true. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2994.42s)]
*  He said he wants to make sure that they are as safe as possible for kids. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=2997.98s)]
*  So we talk about, oh, God, don't take my McDonald's. But mom should not have a say about this. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3001.94s)]
*  It's like there's a way to do it. Processed foods are not going to go away. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3006.46s)]
*  But I guess the difference, Gillian, between vaccines and your decision to eat fruit loops is vaccines, let's say, against one we would all agree is essential polio. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3009.78s)]
*  But no one's talking about it. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3020.3s)]
*  But the difference is it relies on herd immunity. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3022.22s)]
*  It relies on us making a collective choice in a way that few other public health issues do. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3025.06s)]
*  That's why it's such a different case by case. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3032.58s)]
*  You can't just lump all vaccines into one thing. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3035.8199999999997s)]
*  You can't do that. No, no, I'm just making a categorical difference of why I don't think it's a red herring to talk about because well, OK. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3038.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, to say, OK, so to say Kennedy was responsible for Samoa, no, he wasn't. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3045.7799999999997s)]
*  What ended up happening in 2018 is that two kids died from an MMR vaccine that was improperly prepared. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3049.86s)]
*  And that's exactly the kind of stuff he's advocating to prevent forever. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3056.1400000000003s)]
*  He was out there in 2019. He had no direct connection to that incident whatsoever and yet was smeared with it. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3060.38s)]
*  And let's be very clear, Bobby, very clear. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3066.5800000000004s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy is not responsible for the lack of faith of our public health authorities. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3070.2200000000003s)]
*  The public health authorities are responsible for that. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3074.26s)]
*  Let's talk about mental health, mental health for a minute. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3077.98s)]
*  Last year, 40 percent of high school students in this country, 40 percent said they frequently felt sad or sad, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3082.14s)]
*  like crippling despair or hopelessness. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3089.34s)]
*  And 20 percent said they seriously considered suicide. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3093.38s)]
*  What is the relationship between the issues we've been talking about, diet, environment, exercise and mental health? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3096.66s)]
*  And Jillian, let's start with you. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3105.14s)]
*  I mean, I was that kid, so I can speak to it personally. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3106.38s)]
*  I was probably 170 pounds by the time I was 13 years old. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3109.7400000000002s)]
*  Severe ADD, polycystic ovarian syndrome that I ended up discovering when I was 15. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3114.2200000000003s)]
*  So I was still eating garbage, even though I had gotten into martial arts and was gradually losing the weight. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3120.42s)]
*  So having been that kid, there's no question that this garbage food absolutely contributes to it. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3124.5s)]
*  And again, this is where Dr. Palmer could speak to it so much more eloquently than I can, because that's what he does for a living. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3132.3s)]
*  And Nita. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3137.9s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3138.46s)]
*  But with that said, I can speak from personal experience. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3139.98s)]
*  And then I was fortunate enough to get into martial arts, be educated, be empowered and reclaim my health over time. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3142.7000000000003s)]
*  Vani has a very similar story. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3149.7400000000002s)]
*  She was just a little bit older than I was and unfortunately had to hit that rock bottom to make that change. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3151.2200000000003s)]
*  There was, you know, I was intercepted earlier. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3157.98s)]
*  Fortunately, there was an intervention when I was at a younger age, but there's no question that this crap is playing a role. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3160.5s)]
*  No question. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3166.78s)]
*  I mean, it's unacceptable that when I went to my doctor with a problem at work where I had a harassing boss that they put me on Ambien, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3168.02s)]
*  Cymbalta and Xanax instead of saying, hey, you're young. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3178.58s)]
*  Why don't you just quit your job? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3183.02s)]
*  Right. Like, like, what? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3184.7s)]
*  Why? Why are we putting our people in that position? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3188.3399999999997s)]
*  Right. Like, why don't you quit your job, meditate, have some yoga, go work out? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3191.8199999999997s)]
*  You're young. You'll go find something. Right. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3196.9s)]
*  Like, you don't belong in this position. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3198.9s)]
*  And we're not empowering our doctors and our medical community to handle this subject in the right way, which is through root cause intervention [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3200.94s)]
*  and why you see the rise of functional medicine doctors and why that's so important for the future of this country. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3209.74s)]
*  And I'm so grateful for people like, you know, Dr. Palmer here. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3215.66s)]
*  And, OK, let's go to Dr. Palmer. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3219.58s)]
*  He's amazing. He's incredible. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3221.54s)]
*  He's written a seminal book on how depression, mental health disorders and brain disorders, you can say much better, but it's tied to not a drug deficiencies. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3224.06s)]
*  Twenty five percent of women are on some kind of psychiatric drug right now, but it's actually tied to our underlying metabolic health. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3232.2599999999998s)]
*  It's all connected, obviously. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3238.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm thinking about the combo you just laid out. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3240.02s)]
*  Like, you must have been catatonic. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3242.22s)]
*  I mean, you have no idea. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3244.06s)]
*  And thank goodness I was able to get off. Right. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3245.82s)]
*  And the only way was through an amazing integrative psychiatrist who also practiced acupuncture and got me off of all that stuff. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3248.62s)]
*  Right. And it's like, why aren't we looking at these other modalities on how to save us? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3258.86s)]
*  Speaking of psychedelics is something we have not mentioned in this conversation. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3263.74s)]
*  Really interesting. Like the way that that's coming up on the right and the left. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3268.7s)]
*  Where you guys stand on psychedelics? Where's the Maha movement? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3273.34s)]
*  I'll tell you why I'm not speaking. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3276.42s)]
*  Like, what are you on right now? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3277.7400000000002s)]
*  I can tell you I'm on nothing. I judge everybody. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3282.2200000000003s)]
*  That's my stance. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3286.2200000000003s)]
*  We have a situation right now where we have a mental health crisis and it's a societal dynamic that 25 percent of women and a large percentage of the American people are on drugs. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3287.9s)]
*  They're essentially are numbing us out from reality, as Vani is talking about. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3300.42s)]
*  I mean, this is a real societal problem. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3302.82s)]
*  And I think really from a public policy perspective, if you really decipher what the Maha movement is saying, it's like we've got to get to the root cause. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3305.06s)]
*  And the root cause of our mental health crisis is not a SSRI deficiency. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3311.5800000000004s)]
*  It's the fact that we're not in the sun. It's the fact that we're not moving. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3315.5800000000004s)]
*  It's the fact that there's a trauma crisis right now in this country that we're not really grappling with. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3318.54s)]
*  A trauma crisis? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3322.1000000000004s)]
*  A trauma crisis. Absolutely. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3323.5800000000004s)]
*  I think we're committing mass trauma to children right now with what we're feeding them with our culture, with our smartphones. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3325.1400000000003s)]
*  Think about a child, just the evolutionary, like, unprecedented forces that are just tormenting their psyche right now. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3332.02s)]
*  So it's not all bad. Right. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3339.62s)]
*  I mean, I would I'm happy to be living in this time, but it's a it's a crazy environment of just unprecedented forces against the child's mental health and metabolic health. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3341.62s)]
*  So what psychedelics represent, I mean, personally speaking, Casey and I have talked about this, our experience psychedelics after my mom died is, I mean, the most impactful moment of my life. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3351.9s)]
*  And I attribute, you know, responsible for a lot of what I'm doing and it's been one of the most positive experiences ever. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3361.62s)]
*  I think it does represent a modality that gets to somewhat of a root cause, because instead of numbing yourself, you're able to potentially, I think with the right integration, right therapy, with with it appropriately done, able to get to a spot where you're actually able to form new pathways and actually [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3369.94s)]
*  potentially readdress some of the ingrained trauma that we all face. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3390.42s)]
*  So I mean, I think it's a very promising therapeutic, much wider. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3393.98s)]
*  We should be aggressively investing in what Dr. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3397.54s)]
*  Palmer is talking about, about understanding the links between the microbiome and our underlying metabolic health and mental health. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3402.2599999999998s)]
*  We should be investing in therapeutics that every I've never met a veteran that suffers from PTSD, that hasn't gone through appropriate psychedelic therapy, that said it wasn't the most impactful experience of their lives. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3407.62s)]
*  We should be taking that seriously, not having the FDA, which is totally an orgy of corruption with SSRI makers, say that psychedelics are too dangerous and slow that progress. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3417.06s)]
*  So so what Maha represents is we should be doing everything. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3427.1s)]
*  We've got a crisis. We can't get worse than where we are right now. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3430.06s)]
*  We need to be going to much more personalized therapies, much bolder therapies, much more root cause therapies. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3432.46s)]
*  That's what it represents to me. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3437.02s)]
*  Can I speak with on this topic with regard to obesity? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3438.22s)]
*  So people love to tell you diet and exercise don't work. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3442.3s)]
*  Well, they do work. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3446.14s)]
*  It's physics. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3447.22s)]
*  It's the first law of thermodynamics, energy in, energy out. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3448.46s)]
*  That said, a large amount of the people that lose weight can't keep it off. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3452.62s)]
*  Ninety five percent. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3457.46s)]
*  In fact, now you've got to ask the bigger question. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3458.62s)]
*  Why? So, of course, we can look at the fact that the food is designed to be physically addictive. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3461.14s)]
*  There's no question that your biology is being hijacked, but your psychology is also being exploited. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3466.06s)]
*  Everybody that I worked with who was not 20 pounds overweight, we're talking about 50 pounds, 100 pounds overweight, had trauma. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3472.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'll give you examples. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3480.7400000000002s)]
*  So Dr. Phil once said this, and I remember thinking he was such a jerk back in the day. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3481.94s)]
*  And then I understood completely you're fat because you want to be fat. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3486.62s)]
*  And what that means is that the food or the weight is providing you with something so psychologically significant [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3490.34s)]
*  that at one time or another, it meant your psychological survival. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3497.58s)]
*  If you were molested, if you were incested and you de-sexualized by gaining weight. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3501.2999999999997s)]
*  That's one example. I worked with a kid who would eat with his mother. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3506.8199999999997s)]
*  And when he lost weight, she would withdraw and become depressed. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3511.1s)]
*  So, of course, losing food represented a primal abandonment. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3514.3799999999997s)]
*  I could go on and on and on. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3518.1s)]
*  So I spoke with Matt Johnson, who is an incredible researcher with psilocybin in particular, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3519.7799999999997s)]
*  but utilizing therapeutics to treat addiction. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3525.5s)]
*  And I asked him, I was like, Matt, one session of psilocybin, 85 percent smoking succession rate. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3528.74s)]
*  Incredible science there. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3536.5s)]
*  I was like, can you use this for people who are morbidly obese to treat those traumas, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3539.62s)]
*  to get to the bottom of it, to deal with the deeper issues? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3543.7s)]
*  And the thing is, it's not legal. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3547.02s)]
*  He's like, I'd have to get a study funded. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3549.22s)]
*  Like, we don't know yet, but it sure seems like, yeah, it would help a lot. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3553.2999999999997s)]
*  There are no side effects to psilocybin. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3557.34s)]
*  There are a lot of side effects to ozempic, which we'll talk about later. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3560.1000000000004s)]
*  We're going to talk about that on the side. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3565.02s)]
*  We'll talk about that later, OK? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3566.02s)]
*  So I need to tell you what happened to my dad. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3567.46s)]
*  You're going to tell me. Yeah. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3569.5s)]
*  Guys, one thing I've been thinking about is you're on stage and it's like [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3570.5s)]
*  you've all been in the counterculture position. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3574.9s)]
*  You are now moving like firmly into not the counterculture, but the culture. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3577.9s)]
*  How do you foresee that changing you? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3583.1800000000003s)]
*  Because it's a really profound thing, I think, to go from the sort of [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3586.18s)]
*  gadfly or outcast position looking inside the window to actually making policy. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3590.98s)]
*  And the other part of that question, I guess, is if you're asked to serve [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3597.54s)]
*  in this administration, would you say yes? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3600.3799999999997s)]
*  Callie, is the administration. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3603.54s)]
*  Yes or no? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3604.94s)]
*  I'm not serving right now. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3607.58s)]
*  So if asked, would you? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3609.2599999999998s)]
*  If Bobby, the president, called and said I had to do something, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3611.14s)]
*  you know, I'm not planning to do anything right now and I'm going to be a great, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3615.1s)]
*  you know, trying to be an ally and we all are to Bobby and Trump. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3619.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean, the answer to your question, not serving. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3623.1s)]
*  And and I think we have a mass opportunity and I'm and I really a risk [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3625.7s)]
*  and an opportunity where we need to solidify the Maha movement. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3631.8199999999997s)]
*  It's not solidified. I don't think we're solidified in the culture yet. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3634.46s)]
*  I think Bobby has tapped into light and President Trump has tapped into light. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3637.22s)]
*  And we need all hands on deck from the outside, you know, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3640.58s)]
*  independent press holding them to account, but also, you know, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3644.38s)]
*  talking about the corruption that's saying the very celebrating [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3647.94s)]
*  wins that are unimpeachable, like getting our food healthier. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3651.54s)]
*  We have this tools, I think, that we've never had on behalf of kids. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3655.2200000000003s)]
*  Where we have you, we have Joe Rogan, we have Andrew Huberman, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3659.6200000000003s)]
*  we have Megyn Kelly, we have the independent media, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3662.9s)]
*  which now has more eyeballs than the traditional media that cares about this [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3665.54s)]
*  issue, that's shining a light on that's not subject to pharma. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3668.9s)]
*  And I think, you know, we need to just show President Trump and Bobby [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3671.62s)]
*  just continued wins and momentum. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3674.58s)]
*  I believe that if I want to change health care to more preventative form. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3675.94s)]
*  And I think the way we do that is we help President Trump. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3681.5s)]
*  We help Republicans to be totally candid, have Maha help them in the midterms, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3684.66s)]
*  because if this is an enduring political coalition, as you said, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3688.8599999999997s)]
*  I think it is one of the most powerful coalitions in the country right now. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3691.54s)]
*  You've actually changed the window of health. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3694.42s)]
*  I was speaking to a dean of a top med school recently, and he was saying [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3696.06s)]
*  that professors are kicking and screaming that the NIH is going to have [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3699.78s)]
*  more preventative focused research. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3702.78s)]
*  But in four years, it's going to be the norm. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3704.82s)]
*  Like, that's how you change culture. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3706.5800000000004s)]
*  What's happening with Mark Zuckerberg? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3707.7000000000003s)]
*  Who knows what his motivations are? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3708.82s)]
*  But like you care, though, I don't care. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3710.5s)]
*  I don't care. I don't care that every single professor at Harvard [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3712.1400000000003s)]
*  Med School thinks that Bobby Kennedy is a complete wacko, buffoon, anti-vax idiot. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3716.02s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3719.6600000000003s)]
*  They're going to have to change their incentives [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3720.46s)]
*  because 50 billion dollars of annual NIH money is going to change at his directive. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3722.1000000000004s)]
*  And that's going to change culture over time. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3726.3s)]
*  And in four years, it's going to be the norm. Right. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3728.38s)]
*  So if we can keep this coalition alive anyway, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3730.62s)]
*  so I think that's what we're all really. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3733.5s)]
*  What I'm hearing is a yes that it's asked you would. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3734.82s)]
*  Bunny. Yeah, I don't like having a boss. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3738.38s)]
*  So I cannot imagine you having a boss. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3740.7400000000002s)]
*  I know. I just I think my power is is greater on the outside. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3744.58s)]
*  Yeah, totally the truth. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3749.54s)]
*  And and I see that I'm giving a voice to so many moms out there [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3750.58s)]
*  and so many Americans out there that have felt this incredible passion [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrpnZY74Zfw&t=3756.38s)]
