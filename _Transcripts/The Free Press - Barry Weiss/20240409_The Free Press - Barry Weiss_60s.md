# Today’s Journalists Have Abandoned Objectivity
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I)
*  I came up under old school journalistic rules. You don't donate to campaigns, you don't march on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=0.0s)]
*  behalf of political causes. A lot of the journalists I looked up to have never voted in an election [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=4.96s)]
*  because they want to, they understand that we are subjective people, that we all have our biases, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=10.72s)]
*  but they want to maintain as much objectivity as possible. And I was looking at Instagram stories [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=16.16s)]
*  the other night and I noticed a writer that I always read in the New Yorker, you know, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=21.28s)]
*  with her baby at a anti-Israel protest waving a Palestinian flag. And I'm like, wow, like that's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=24.72s)]
*  just going to color the way that I read her stories, seeing that. And that has just become [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=31.36s)]
*  something that is now extremely normative among legacy journalists. And it's a shift that I think [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=36.88s)]
*  is actually quite profound. I totally agree. I mean, I think that there are a lot of journalists [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=43.84s)]
*  now who feel like they are obligated to do stories that are aligned with their sense of justice [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=48.72s)]
*  or to try and undo power structures. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgZcK_6n5I&t=56.56s)]
