Peggy Noonan does what we try to do every day at The Free Press: tell the truth, make sense of things plainly and without pretension, frame the news in a way that helps the reader make sense of things, and put things in a historical context that gives the day-to-day depth and meaning. 

The very annoying thing about Peggy Noonan is that she makes the thing that we know is so very hard look so very easy. And she does it week after week after week in The Wall Street Journal—which adds up to more than 400 columns over the last 25 years. 

In her newest—and ninth—book, A Certain Idea of America, she collects 80 of her best columns published over the last eight years. Now, the idea that old newspaper columns might be good fodder for a book sort of seems like a weird idea, given that newspapers are most famous for being the next day’s fish wrapper. But somehow this book feels urgent and timeless. Which means that Peggy Noonan’s old columns are better than most people’s brand-new ones.

That’s probably because she knows a thing or two about rhetoric and American politics. She was a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan. She helped President George H.W. Bush get elected. She consulted for the TV show The West Wing. 

In today’s conversation, we talk about how Peggy understands Trump’s win and the political revolution that we’re living through, what it feels like to lose in a values war, and what it feels like to defend things like civility and decency in 2024. We also talk about Trump’s appointments so far, Peggy’s first meeting with Trump, and how, despite our troubles, America remains a good and great country—and why it’s so important for young people to know that.

# Peggy Noonan on How to Save America | Free Press Book Club
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI)
*  Peggy Noonan is quite simply the master. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=0.0s)]
*  She does what we try and do every day at the free press, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=4.2s)]
*  to tell the truth, to make sense of things plainly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  and without pretension, to frame the news in a way [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=11.6s)]
*  that helps the reader make sense of things, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=14.68s)]
*  and ideally, to put things in a historical context that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=16.92s)]
*  gives the day-to-day depth and meaning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=20.48s)]
*  And the very annoying thing about Peggy Noonan [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=23.56s)]
*  is that she makes this thing that we know is so very hard [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=26.4s)]
*  look extremely easy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=31.2s)]
*  And she does it week after week after week. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  Over the past 25 years, she's written a column [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=35.48s)]
*  in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=38.28s)]
*  She's written more than 400 of them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=39.4s)]
*  400 columns is like 8 million tweets, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=41.4s)]
*  which is my preferred medium. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=44.16s)]
*  And her new book, A Certain Idea of America, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=46.72s)]
*  she collects 80 of them published [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=49.72s)]
*  over the last eight years. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=52.0s)]
*  Now, the idea that old newspaper columns [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=53.68s)]
*  might be good fodder for a book sort of seems [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=56.12s)]
*  like a weird idea, given that newspapers are famous for being [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=59.16s)]
*  the next day's fish wrapper. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=62.36s)]
*  But somehow, this book feels timeless and poignant [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=64.28s)]
*  and urgent all at the same time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=67.8s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is that Peggy Noonan's old columns are [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=70.36s)]
*  better than most people's brand new ones. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  And this is exactly the book we need right now, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=77.44s)]
*  except maybe a book on how we're going to survive World War III. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=79.32s)]
*  So Peggy Noonan, thank you for being here tonight. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=81.88s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=98.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=99.6s)]
*  And thank you, all of you, on a busy Tuesday night. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=100.28s)]
*  Thank you, all of you, for coming. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  They have nowhere else to be. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=106.44s)]
*  This is where they wanted to be. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=107.84s)]
*  Well, Peggy, I want to start with, I guess, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=109.56s)]
*  a question about how much things have changed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=111.92s)]
*  When I think of the word civilized, I think about you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=114.72s)]
*  You don't curse, at least not in public. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=119.56s)]
*  You are from a generation of public figures [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=121.84s)]
*  who value things like grace and good manners and tastefulness [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  and discretion and incrementalism and everything [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=128.64s)]
*  that we don't have right now in our public life. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  And I guess I want to ask, when did all of the things [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  that you so emblemize and stand for fall so out of fashion? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=138.68s)]
*  Oh, what's the wonderful cliche we're all using now? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=144.8s)]
*  Slowly and then suddenly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=150.12s)]
*  You know? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=152.52s)]
*  I guess it's- [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  How we went bankrupt. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  That's Hemingway, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  I think it's from The Sun Also Rises anyway. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=158.56s)]
*  I think things have a way of deteriorating slowly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=163.0s)]
*  And then there are moments when you can see the deterioration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=167.04s)]
*  I think our political life more or less started [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=171.28s)]
*  to become a rougher. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  And almost, base is the wrong word, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=180.12s)]
*  but a rougher and less elevated thing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  About 2015, when maybe everybody's frustrations [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  rose so much that it was inevitable [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=192.44s)]
*  that they'd throw off what they had experienced as shackles [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=195.16s)]
*  and which we experience as standards and expectations. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=198.92s)]
*  What does it feel like emotionally [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=203.72s)]
*  to sort of realize that something significant, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  what we call standards, what does it feel like that that, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=210.88s)]
*  at least for now, feels out of reach or lost? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=214.4s)]
*  Oh, that's so interesting. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=217.28s)]
*  And I think maybe for other people in this room who feel that way, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=218.6s)]
*  how do you cling to those or really elevate those virtues [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=221.64s)]
*  in a moment where so many other people have sloughed them off? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=227.04s)]
*  I've worried about two things, about the falling of standards [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=230.2s)]
*  in two areas. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=235.0s)]
*  Only one is politics. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  The other is journalism, where the old standards have been [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=238.16s)]
*  replaced by something less impressive. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=245.28s)]
*  That is way too diplomatic. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=252.84s)]
*  I am not sure how mainstream journalism fully reclaims [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=258.6s)]
*  the best of its old standards, while still, you know, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=266.56s)]
*  ages change while still traveling into the modern. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=270.92s)]
*  Politically, I think sometimes, what will it take? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=274.72s)]
*  There are plenty of people in politics [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=277.8s)]
*  still who uphold the sort of presentation of adulthood. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  They tend to be, I think, more governors. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=286.24s)]
*  State by state, the governors and state legislators [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  are very often just presenting themselves [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  in public in a more sort of adult way. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  It's funny that the states are higher in this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  or better in this than the feds. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=302.56s)]
*  Maybe on the federal level, somebody at some future point [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  will come forward and radiate the old dignity, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  but also in a way so interesting and compelling [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=316.44s)]
*  that he or she will help bring the old dignity back. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=319.8s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  Before we move on, is there anyone [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=327.64s)]
*  that you're thinking of that has the potential to do that? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=329.56s)]
*  No, I just realized as I was talking, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  I was thinking of pieces. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=334.8s)]
*  I was thinking sort of of pieces of people. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  And actually, I was just thinking of a certain look [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=341.96s)]
*  as opposed to the inner thing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=344.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=350.08s)]
*  I meet so many young people who are so deeply impressive [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=351.24s)]
*  throughout the country, maybe one of them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=355.16s)]
*  Before we talk about your new book, A Certain Idea of America, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  I want to talk about your book that's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  had the biggest impact on me. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  And I imagine your most famous book. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=365.36s)]
*  And that book is, of course, what I saw at the revolution, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=367.04s)]
*  which is a book about your time in the Reagan administration [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  as a, I forget what the title was, special assistant, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  speechwriter. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=376.16s)]
*  It was a speechwriter. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=377.0s)]
*  And I just always love that title so, so much. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  And you see so many headlines that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=381.56s)]
*  are ripoffs of that title. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=382.92s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=384.44s)]
*  I love it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=385.08s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=385.76s)]
*  You never can top it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, maybe we can. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  Maybe we can. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=390.12s)]
*  Maybe we just did. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=390.64s)]
*  But it's an incredible title. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=391.4s)]
*  And 40 years later, we are here, of course, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=393.44s)]
*  living through a different kind of revolution [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=397.67999999999995s)]
*  with a different kind of outsider [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=400.88s)]
*  in the figure of Donald Trump that just pulled together [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=402.88s)]
*  an extraordinarily unlikely coalition of voters who [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=405.96s)]
*  swept in and not just won the presidency, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=410.52s)]
*  but has won the House and the Senate, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=413.24s)]
*  and arguably is sort of ushering in a title change of the culture. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=415.16s)]
*  And I wonder if you could just spend a minute maybe thinking [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=420.24s)]
*  about the revolution that you witnessed and the one [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=423.68s)]
*  that we are living through right now, because I feel, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=427.52s)]
*  as I'm sure you do, that there are some obvious differences [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=431.52s)]
*  between the two. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=435.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=436.16s)]
*  You know, I just came up on the train from Washington. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=437.6s)]
*  And every time I am in Washington, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=441.12s)]
*  I somehow wind up staying around the White House. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=443.4s)]
*  And when I see it, I have a feeling of immense poignance, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=447.48s)]
*  but also a protectiveness. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=451.52s)]
*  And I notice things like Lafayette Square, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=454.16s)]
*  the park right across from the White House that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=456.76s)]
*  has the big statue of Andrew Jackson [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=459.12s)]
*  that somebody tried to spray paint or tear down [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  in the past few years. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=465.36s)]
*  It's gotten a little bit shabby looking, the whole park. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=467.12s)]
*  And it used to look better and greener and crisper. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=470.88s)]
*  And it wasn't all surrounded by cheap fences [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=475.12s)]
*  to keep the people out. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=479.12s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=481.12s)]
*  A good thing about Donald Trump is [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=482.8s)]
*  he's the kind of guy who would look at Lafayette Park and say, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  we need a gold toilet here. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=488.12s)]
*  He would say that marble is too cheap, first of all. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=491.56s)]
*  Get rid of that pedestal. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=495.12s)]
*  But he would say the grass should be much nicer. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=496.56s)]
*  And we should be taking down the fences. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=499.76000000000005s)]
*  And this should be pretty. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=502.44000000000005s)]
*  And people should go and bring their kids there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  He would actually have that thought. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=507.08000000000004s)]
*  It actually, I know for a fact, disturbs him [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=509.48s)]
*  that Washington's physical look has so deteriorated. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=512.08s)]
*  The revolution that I was part of, 1980, 1988, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=516.6s)]
*  was a revolution in the old world. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  America looked absolutely the same. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=526.28s)]
*  And American people looked absolutely the same [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=529.8s)]
*  in the days after that revolution. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=533.56s)]
*  It was a revolution within a party. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=536.4s)]
*  The conservatives of America had laboriously, over 20 years, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=538.56s)]
*  taken over the Republican Party. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=543.8s)]
*  And suddenly, they had this rather dashing, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  shining new president. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=549.76s)]
*  I did a Q&A last night with a guy named Fred Ryan [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=552.16s)]
*  at the Reagan Institute in Washington. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=557.4s)]
*  And Fred and I were remembering that we [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=561.68s)]
*  worked for the person who was then the oldest [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=565.88s)]
*  president in American history. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=569.68s)]
*  I think Reagan was sworn in just after turning 70, which [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=571.68s)]
*  was so incredibly old then. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  But Reagan's White House was full of young people. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=579.16s)]
*  We apparently were the youngest presidential staff ever. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=584.0s)]
*  And Fred and I marveled over the fact [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=589.32s)]
*  that we had significant positions. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=591.4s)]
*  And we were in our 20s and early 30s. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=594.0s)]
*  There's a very good thing about that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=597.0s)]
*  It's good to have the young there, believing and fighting [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=598.64s)]
*  for and bringing not just their energy, but their freshness. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=602.64s)]
*  Anyway, how does that compare to now? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=608.08s)]
*  Now, this revolution feels like a more cultural revolution, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  as if America is changing the way it looks [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=615.5200000000001s)]
*  and how it experiences itself and who it is. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  They sometimes confuse me, Trump and those around him. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=624.88s)]
*  One of the things they're doing right now, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=629.1600000000001s)]
*  it would seem commonsensical to me [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=632.0400000000001s)]
*  that Donald Trump having won a fabulous victory. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=635.04s)]
*  Now, we're still, it wasn't a landslide. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=639.16s)]
*  It was a victory in the, he got the popular vote, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=641.92s)]
*  first Republican in 20 years. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=646.64s)]
*  But it was a close victory. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=648.52s)]
*  It'll apparently be a victory by 1.5% of the vote. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=649.8s)]
*  But they got closely the House and not so closely the Senate. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=655.16s)]
*  So it does, I think it can totally be claimed as a mandate. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=660.32s)]
*  But there's mandates and there's mandates. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=665.5600000000001s)]
*  This is not FDR in 1932, and it's not Reagan in 80. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=667.7600000000001s)]
*  So I would think Donald Trump right now [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=672.48s)]
*  would be very eager to feel personally triumphant, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=674.7600000000001s)]
*  even triumphalist. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=681.08s)]
*  It's utterly understandable that the people around him [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=682.9200000000001s)]
*  feel that way. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  They worked hard for what they've done. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=687.36s)]
*  But if they were cannier or more able to control themselves, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=690.08s)]
*  the biggest thing they would be doing now [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=697.72s)]
*  would be quickly, as they are, rolling out appointees [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  who everybody, whose names everybody has to sort of lean [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=705.2800000000001s)]
*  back and think, whoa, that's an impressive person. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=709.32s)]
*  Like Matt Gaetz. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=712.96s)]
*  So I was at a speech. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=713.92s)]
*  And I arrive at the speech. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=716.92s)]
*  See, this is how classy Peggy Noonan is, yes. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=718.5999999999999s)]
*  I arrive at a speech, and I put on my phone once I landed, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=721.7199999999999s)]
*  and I see Pete Hegseth is going to be Secretary of Defense. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=725.9599999999999s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=731.7199999999999s)]
*  So I go and I make my speech. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=733.9599999999999s)]
*  And I say in the speech, Pete Hegseth, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=736.56s)]
*  So I go and I make my speech. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=739.08s)]
*  And I say in the speech, Pete Hegseth, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=741.68s)]
*  he's a Fox News fellow, he's a nice man, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=743.88s)]
*  two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, culture warrior. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=747.12s)]
*  Fine, the world needs culture warriors. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=751.64s)]
*  But that is not the bio of the guy [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=754.4399999999999s)]
*  who runs the three million man and woman highly bureaucratized, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=756.96s)]
*  depthfully bureaucratized bureaucracy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=764.0s)]
*  That is, the Department of Defense, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=767.96s)]
*  which runs all of the branches of the service, which [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=770.96s)]
*  is so complex. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=774.16s)]
*  The office was held by George C. Marshall, by Frank Carlucci, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=775.84s)]
*  by Bob Gates. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=783.56s)]
*  These were substantial and serious men [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=785.48s)]
*  who understood that thing that they'd been running. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=789.28s)]
*  They also were serious diplomats, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=793.44s)]
*  because the head of the Department of Defense [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=795.7600000000001s)]
*  has a huge and growing each year diplomatic function. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=798.84s)]
*  The president can't always go over, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=803.6400000000001s)]
*  of the US can't always go over, and meet [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=805.6s)]
*  with the president of Germany, sends the Department of Defense [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=808.12s)]
*  chief to that. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=813.0s)]
*  OK, so Pete Hegseth, that's crazy. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=814.32s)]
*  So I said that in the speech. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=816.24s)]
*  After the speech, and everybody sort of laughed and made [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=818.0s)]
*  those noises like I agree. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=821.76s)]
*  And after the speech, I was talking [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=824.2s)]
*  with an audience member who came up to me with a phone. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=826.2s)]
*  And he said, Matt Gates is going to be the new attorney general. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  And I said, stop teasing me, because I [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=834.28s)]
*  knew I'd been tough on Hegseth. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=837.42s)]
*  And he said, no, I'm serious, and showed me the headline, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=839.24s)]
*  which happened while I was speaking. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=842.6s)]
*  And I thought, why are Trump and his people [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=844.68s)]
*  doing the opposite of what they should be doing, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=847.92s)]
*  which is impressing us? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=851.44s)]
*  You know why they should be impressing us? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=853.24s)]
*  First of all, they're Americans, and they love Americans, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=854.96s)]
*  and it makes everybody feel better. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=857.5600000000001s)]
*  But you want to rub it in somebody's face? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=859.6s)]
*  Be much better than they expected. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=862.6s)]
*  That's what they ought to be doing. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=865.72s)]
*  Instead, they're going lower than most people [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=867.4000000000001s)]
*  had anticipated. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=871.08s)]
*  So what the heck is that? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=872.72s)]
*  Are there any appointees, just very briefly, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=874.84s)]
*  that you feel excited about? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=877.7600000000001s)]
*  Well, I was excited, no. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=879.36s)]
*  But a feeling of good. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=884.08s)]
*  Susie Wiles, as chief of staff, a very serious, stable, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=887.76s)]

*  Good news. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=897.36s)]
*  Who ran a good campaign. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=899.72s)]
*  Not the bar is so high. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=900.8000000000001s)]
*  Who ran a good campaign, and who knows something [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=902.0s)]
*  about executive responsibilities and functions. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=905.0s)]
*  Marco Rubio, as secretary of state, just fine. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=909.32s)]
*  There are a few others. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=914.2800000000001s)]
*  I can't remember their names, but that highly recommends them. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=916.2800000000001s)]
*  Cabinet people, cabinet appointees [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=920.2800000000001s)]
*  should be normally impressive people whose names you can't [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  really remember. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=926.6800000000001s)]
*  It's like a good sign. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=927.6s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, you can remember. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=929.48s)]
*  Peggy, when I think back on political rhetoric [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=933.7600000000001s)]
*  over the past eight years between lock her up, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=936.96s)]
*  grab her by the pussy, the rhetoric has not [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=940.2800000000001s)]
*  exactly been soaring. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=942.96s)]
*  And I went back and I read, really crying in the office [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=944.8000000000001s)]
*  today, both at what we've lost, but also [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=948.24s)]
*  at the beauty of the words, what you wrote for Reagan. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=950.12s)]
*  And I just want to read a few lines, of course, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=953.72s)]
*  maybe they're most famous you've ever written [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=956.2s)]
*  from when the Challenger exploded. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=958.0400000000001s)]
*  The crew of the space shuttle Challenger [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=960.24s)]
*  honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  We will never forget them, nor the last time [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=965.76s)]
*  we saw them this morning, as they prepared for their journey [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=967.8s)]
*  and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of Earth [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=970.8s)]
*  to touch the face of God. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=974.04s)]
*  I would love for you to talk a little bit about what [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=979.28s)]
*  has happened to our language and the degradation of language [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=982.6s)]
*  over the past decade of American life. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=987.04s)]
*  Well, I will start out with bitching about something. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=989.72s)]
*  I agree with what you said about the banality now [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=994.36s)]
*  of political speaking and rhetoric. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1000.16s)]
*  You didn't feel the joy of Kamala Harris? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, she started out OK, a little behind the eight ball, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1007.16s)]
*  but she started out OK. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  But it quickly turned into something unimpressive. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1012.6s)]
*  By the way, Barry, did you see someone had a poll out today [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1016.32s)]
*  saying she would be the leading, according [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1020.52s)]
*  to the poll Democrats, and found that she [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1024.6s)]
*  was the most popular choice for the presidential candidacy [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  of 2028? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1033.0s)]
*  That is just so crazy. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1035.92s)]
*  I got to admit to you, I read the headline on the first line. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1037.48s)]
*  So maybe it was the onion and I didn't know it. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1040.28s)]
*  But it's like the Republicans, they are crude but clear. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1043.36s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, it's just word salad. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1047.04s)]
*  As my sister said, or my sister Nellie, one of them [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1049.4s)]
*  said, it's word shaped air. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1052.2800000000002s)]
*  It's nothingness. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1053.96s)]
*  It's nothingness. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1055.8000000000002s)]
*  So what's going on here? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1056.64s)]
*  The left seems to not be able to say anything clearly. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1059.92s)]
*  And the right seems to almost be too clear in what they want [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1063.44s)]
*  to say. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1066.92s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1067.4s)]
*  Barack Obama was considered a great rhetorician [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1069.3200000000002s)]
*  and a spellbinding speech giver. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1072.6000000000001s)]
*  But I have to tell you, nothing he ever said [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1077.32s)]
*  ever stuck in my mind. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1080.1599999999999s)]
*  It all seemed rounded. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1082.6399999999999s)]
*  Like no edge. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1086.48s)]
*  Rounded and sort of elegant in a way, or intending to be elegant. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1088.1599999999999s)]
*  And there were nice words. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1095.56s)]
*  And there was a feeling of aspirational somehow. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1098.36s)]
*  But it never really, to my mind, wound up [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  being a thought. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1106.8s)]
*  When Obama was first coming in 2007, 2008, 2009, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1109.72s)]
*  he had this reputation as a political speaker. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1117.28s)]
*  I would watch him give a speech and think, that's kind of good. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1120.68s)]
*  But I would also find on the internet, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1126.04s)]
*  print out the speech and an hour later read it. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1128.36s)]
*  And there was something so interesting [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  in that Obama giving a speech was so much better [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1134.92s)]
*  than the speech. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1137.52s)]
*  Because Obama himself was compelling, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  but was very careful not to say anything that was compelling. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1141.16s)]
*  It was an odd thing. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1144.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris, deliberately you would [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1149.0s)]
*  think somebody running for office [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1154.72s)]
*  would want very much to invite you into their mind, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1156.8000000000002s)]
*  into their thinking, into their approach of problems [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1161.96s)]
*  and challenges. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1166.28s)]
*  But everything she said was designed [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1167.8s)]
*  to make you not know what she thought [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1170.32s)]
*  or what her approach was. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1173.08s)]
*  So at this point, it does strike me [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1174.92s)]
*  as a deliberate strategy of the left. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1177.08s)]
*  Sound quasi lofty, but don't really say a thing. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1180.88s)]
*  This for me, by the way, the most irritating thing [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1187.24s)]
*  was President Biden's, you might call it a line, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1189.56s)]
*  but you might call it a tick. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1193.08s)]
*  Biden has spent the past two years saying, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1195.1599999999999s)]
*  there is nothing that divides us as much as there [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1198.48s)]
*  is that unites us. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1202.56s)]
*  I think I just said that in a less literate way. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1205.8s)]
*  But he was just always saying, whatever divides us, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1208.6799999999998s)]
*  it's not as big as what unites us. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1211.44s)]
*  But there was no context. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  He never named what unites us. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1215.9199999999998s)]
*  He never named what divides us. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1217.88s)]
*  But he just kept insisting on saying it as if we'd all go, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1219.96s)]
*  that never occurred to me. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1225.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1227.3600000000001s)]
*  So at this point, I'm just irritated with the left. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1229.4s)]
*  Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1232.2800000000002s)]
*  has made such a good impression on people, in part [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1235.4s)]
*  because actually when you listen to him, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1238.16s)]
*  you kind of know what he's saying. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1240.3200000000002s)]
*  So that's pretty fabulous. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1242.3200000000002s)]
*  And it comes as a relief. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1245.4s)]
*  Trump really wants you to know what he means. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1247.88s)]
*  He tells you. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1250.52s)]
*  He tells you to a degree that makes [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1251.76s)]
*  you go lean backwards a little bit. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1253.8000000000002s)]
*  It's like the colleague that told me [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1255.68s)]
*  the day he was preparing for a colonoscopy. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1256.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm like, I don't need to know that. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1258.8000000000002s)]
*  I love you, but I don't need to know that. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1260.88s)]
*  But anyway, there's this TMI quality. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1264.88s)]
*  It's like, I don't need to know what you're thinking [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1268.8000000000002s)]
*  about every single thing. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1270.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1271.88s)]
*  Trump is an interesting character. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1273.96s)]
*  You know, I never met Trump until two or three weeks ago. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1276.04s)]
*  Did I ever tell you that? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1280.2s)]
*  Well, you just buried the lead. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1281.52s)]
*  Oh. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1282.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm hearing from Joe and Mika [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1284.16s)]
*  that they had this reproach month [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1285.8s)]
*  as if it's like the Soviet Union and America [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1287.76s)]
*  convening in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1289.8400000000001s)]
*  And here's Peggy 20 minutes into the conversation saying [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1291.56s)]
*  you met Trump. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1294.44s)]
*  Tell us the context. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1295.4s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1296.32s)]
*  In 2015 and 2016, when he was deciding to or had [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1297.32s)]
*  decided to run for president, was running. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1301.8s)]
*  His office and his aides did what [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1304.6s)]
*  they would do with anybody else in journalism, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1309.28s)]
*  which was reach out and say, we want to know you. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1311.9199999999998s)]
*  We want to meet you. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1314.72s)]
*  Come on in. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1315.6s)]
*  Meet the boss. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1316.32s)]
*  Have lunch. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1317.2s)]
*  And I always said, no, I don't want to. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1318.48s)]
*  And the reason was I had a feeling that up close he [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1321.52s)]
*  would be charming and funny and that there would be something [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1327.68s)]
*  endearing and that it would mess with my swing as an observer. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1334.04s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't want to see him up close. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1340.68s)]
*  I didn't want to see him far away. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1342.76s)]
*  I wanted to have this intuitive sense, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1344.1200000000001s)]
*  see him at a middle distance. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1346.48s)]
*  And I felt I saw him clearly at a middle distance. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1348.96s)]
*  So the years pass and the tweets happen, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1353.68s)]
*  and he attacks me at rallies, and it's fabulous. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1357.72s)]
*  About two, I mean, it was really interesting. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1362.64s)]
*  I'll look back on it kind of warmly in a weird way. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1365.6000000000001s)]
*  So two or three weeks ago, he came to the Wall Street Journal [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1368.96s)]
*  for an editorial board meeting. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1372.88s)]
*  And my instinct kicked in again, don't go. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1375.0s)]
*  But then I corrected myself. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1379.2800000000002s)]
*  I've been writing about him for eight years. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1381.2800000000002s)]
*  I have occasionally clubbed him like a seal. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1383.56s)]
*  He has occasionally clubbed me. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1388.12s)]
*  And it would be so wrong if he came to my newspaper [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1391.6399999999999s)]
*  and he couldn't go there and take retribution or do [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1395.6399999999999s)]
*  whatever he wanted to do. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1402.96s)]
*  It just struck me as the fair right thing. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1404.32s)]
*  And so I went. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1408.6s)]
*  And so we're waiting for him. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1410.04s)]
*  He came late. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1411.82s)]
*  He's a guy on a campaign. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1412.68s)]
*  And we're sitting around nervously [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1415.2s)]
*  because it's the Wall Street Journal. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1417.24s)]
*  It's what we do. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1418.96s)]
*  So I'm sitting next to Paul Zhigeau. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1420.6000000000001s)]
*  And in a silence as we nervously wait, Paul says, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1423.04s)]
*  how many times have you met Trump? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1427.0800000000002s)]
*  And I said, I've never met Trump. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1429.88s)]
*  And he said, you've never met Trump? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1432.0s)]
*  And he went, whoa. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1434.5s)]
*  Like, oh, we're going to have a drama here. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1436.16s)]
*  And suddenly I thought, oh, gosh, maybe it will be a drama. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1439.44s)]
*  You know, maybe like you don't know [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1442.76s)]
*  how Trump acts like when he's going to be horrible. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1444.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean, up close. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1448.16s)]
*  So anyway, at a certain point, the doors fly open [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1449.88s)]
*  and the entourage comes in. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1453.2800000000002s)]
*  And there's Trump, who in person in that blue suit and the tie [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1455.1200000000001s)]
*  is huge. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1459.44s)]
*  And the hair is huge. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1461.8000000000002s)]
*  Everything is huge. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1463.8400000000001s)]
*  And he like blows by others. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1466.2800000000002s)]
*  And he just says to me, you are wonderful. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1468.4s)]
*  You are the most remarkable woman. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1473.2800000000002s)]
*  And I was, in a funny way, it was like listening to Joe Biden. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1476.96s)]
*  It was like going backwards again. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1482.3600000000001s)]
*  And then he sat down with us. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1486.96s)]
*  And he was not to go off. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1489.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, he went on and off the record. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1490.48s)]
*  But off the record, he was hilarious, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1492.8000000000002s)]
*  rude, inappropriate, said things about foreign leaders [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1496.92s)]
*  that should not be said to a bunch of journalists. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1500.52s)]
*  And I just sat back and thought by the end, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1504.92s)]
*  honey, your intuition was right. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1507.72s)]
*  If you'd met him in 2015, you would have loved him [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1510.28s)]
*  and not seen him. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1513.4s)]
*  OK, it's amazing to me that he ran up to you and said. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1515.96s)]
*  I think maybe I exaggerated. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1519.04s)]
*  But I would have loved him for a while. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1520.4s)]
*  But that he ran up to you and said, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1522.64s)]
*  you're the most wonderful person in the world. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1524.14s)]
*  Let us remind everyone in this room about what [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1526.06s)]
*  you have written about Trump. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1529.1s)]
*  There's a lot we could quote. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1530.26s)]
*  But here's a column he wrote in January 2021. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1531.46s)]
*  He is a bad man and not a stable one. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1537.46s)]
*  And he is dangerous. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1540.1799999999998s)]
*  America is not safe in his hands. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1541.82s)]
*  You called him the devil and also wrote about his apprentice. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1545.8999999999999s)]
*  The devil and his apprentices, let me be clear. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1549.22s)]
*  This, of course, was days after or the day [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1552.34s)]
*  after what happened on January 6. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1554.94s)]
*  He wrote, as for the chief instigator, the president [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1556.8400000000001s)]
*  of the United States, he should be removed from office, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1560.52s)]
*  he wrote, by the 25th Amendment or impeachment, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1563.5800000000002s)]
*  whichever is faster. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1565.88s)]
*  This with only a week and a half to go [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1567.46s)]
*  would be a most extraordinary action. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1569.04s)]
*  But this has been an extraordinary time. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1571.28s)]
*  You go on in this column to call Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1572.92s)]
*  I thought this was funny. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1575.56s)]
*  Punks practicing punk politics. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1576.72s)]
*  They are like people who know the value of nothing. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1579.16s)]
*  They are careless inheritors of the nation. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1582.3200000000002s)]
*  I could go on. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1584.64s)]
*  I'm not going to because I want to ask not really [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1585.8400000000001s)]
*  to revisit that time because I remember reading that [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1590.3000000000002s)]
*  and thinking, hell yeah, go Peggy. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1593.18s)]
*  But you're someone who trusts in the wisdom [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1595.3000000000002s)]
*  of the American people. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1597.16s)]
*  And the American people have just gone and re-elected [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1598.6200000000001s)]
*  the person that you wrote about that way on January 7 of 2021. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1601.6200000000001s)]
*  What are they seeing, maybe, that you didn't [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1607.0200000000002s)]
*  from a middle distance? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1610.0600000000002s)]
*  And have you, especially having met him a few weeks [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1611.2s)]
*  ago, revised your judgment of the man? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1614.48s)]
*  I wrote that piece. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1618.72s)]
*  I'm very proud of it. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1619.84s)]
*  I wrote that about 20 hours. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1621.08s)]
*  No, it went up on the internet about 20 hours [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1623.96s)]
*  after January 6. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1627.0s)]
*  And there are times in life when you see something and boy, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1629.3600000000001s)]
*  you feel it and you think it and you are going to say it [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1636.3600000000001s)]
*  and you say it as clear as you can. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1640.84s)]
*  And what I thought then is what I think now, what that day was. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1643.56s)]
*  I will add, in fairness, I have a sister who's very, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1653.56s)]
*  I had two sisters who were seriously pro-Trump. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1658.48s)]
*  And one passed away a year and a half ago, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1662.0s)]
*  and the other one is very much here. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1664.08s)]
*  And we have talked about January 6 and what it was to me [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1666.44s)]
*  and what it was to her. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1672.28s)]
*  And she feels it was a really, really bad thing. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1674.24s)]
*  And they got carried away. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1678.42s)]
*  And they all got arrested. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1681.2s)]
*  And they all served time. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1683.6s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1686.6s)]
*  It was one of those things, but it doesn't portend anything. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1687.74s)]
*  That's how she feels about it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1692.32s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1694.24s)]
*  You can fairly say, yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1694.96s)]
*  Oh, she also said, nobody came in with guns and shot people. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1696.68s)]
*  They acted out. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1701.2s)]
*  They'd hit you on the head if they could, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1702.6s)]
*  but they couldn't find anyone to hit on the head. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1704.44s)]
*  Or, well, that's how she saw it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1707.4s)]
*  For me, it is a very different thing and does portend. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1712.24s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump wound those people up and sent them [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1719.28s)]
*  in, knowing who they were and the mayhem they meant to bring. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1724.92s)]
*  And we, to this day, don't know what [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1731.1599999999999s)]
*  would have happened if the wilder ones of them [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1733.28s)]
*  had met up with Nancy Pelosi. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1736.8s)]
*  So it was just so bad. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1740.28s)]
*  We are a 50-50 country. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1743.6s)]
*  The country does not like how things have been [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  run the past four years. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1750.32s)]
*  They did not take to Kamala Harris. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1752.1599999999999s)]
*  Even with that, it's still 50-50. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1755.1999999999998s)]
*  But it was decisive, because it was 50.1 versus 49.9. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1759.12s)]
*  So there you are. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1765.1999999999998s)]
*  But what did the American people see? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1767.1599999999999s)]
*  Or maybe another way of saying it [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1771.3999999999999s)]
*  is, why were they willing to overlook things [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1773.36s)]
*  that even a lot of Trump fans felt were bad? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1776.9199999999998s)]
*  How do you explain? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1780.84s)]
*  In a funny way, I don't think they're overlooking them. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1783.08s)]
*  They are accepting them. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1786.4399999999998s)]
*  Do you mean his mammoth flaws? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1788.2s)]
*  I mean, they are accepting them. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1791.28s)]
*  They know. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1795.0800000000002s)]
*  In my experience of Trump supporters, in a funny way, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1798.24s)]
*  most of them, not all, but most are not [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1802.48s)]
*  illusioned about him really in terms of, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1805.1200000000001s)]
*  they think he's a brander. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1809.88s)]
*  They think he's a bullshitter. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1811.64s)]
*  They think he's a New York real estate guy, which, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1813.52s)]
*  by definition, means a person of ill repute. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1817.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1821.3999999999999s)]
*  There is nobody in America who supports Donald Trump who [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1824.48s)]
*  thinks he didn't pay off the hooker. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1828.1599999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1831.52s)]
*  They don't have illusions in that way. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1832.96s)]
*  Here is the one illusion that I do see that stays. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1835.44s)]
*  There are some eccentric people who [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1840.12s)]
*  compare him to Lincoln and Washington, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1842.52s)]
*  except Lincoln and Washington weren't [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1846.16s)]
*  that good and that strong. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1848.28s)]
*  And there are these strange people [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1852.2s)]
*  who do the religious paintings. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1854.64s)]
*  And there are the people who think he's [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1856.52s)]
*  anointed in the way of King David. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1858.0800000000002s)]
*  But that's kind of a small group. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1862.92s)]
*  But the illusion about Donald Trump [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1865.24s)]
*  that I think is prevalent among a lot of Trump supporters [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1869.96s)]
*  is that he cares about them and that he really [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1875.08s)]
*  is on their side. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1879.96s)]
*  And that's a big part of his appeal, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1882.28s)]
*  that he's on their side. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1884.52s)]
*  When the woke mob comes, he's on their side. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1886.28s)]
*  When the neocon warriors come, he's [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1891.48s)]
*  on their side because they've sent some boys, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1895.6s)]
*  and it didn't work out so well earlier in the century. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1898.08s)]
*  When the bad guys come, he's on their side. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1901.52s)]
*  My read on Donald Trump is he is not on your side. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1904.72s)]
*  He's on Donald Trump's side. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1908.44s)]
*  He's having the time of his life. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1909.96s)]
*  He has impulses and opinions that he acts on, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1912.04s)]
*  but he also has a shrewd understanding [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1916.2s)]
*  of the views and wants of the audience. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1918.52s)]
*  And he meets it, and the audience [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1921.52s)]
*  has given him a hit show. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1923.56s)]
*  I'm sorry to put it so bluntly, but I [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1925.84s)]
*  think that is what drives him. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1929.6000000000001s)]
*  Eight years ago, you identified a dynamic [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1932.44s)]
*  that I think perhaps better than there's [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1936.0800000000002s)]
*  so many explanations for the seismic change [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1938.3600000000001s)]
*  we're living through. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1941.2s)]
*  It's the elites versus the center versus the periphery. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1942.52s)]
*  It's the tower versus the square. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1946.48s)]
*  The way you identified the distinction [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1950.96s)]
*  is between the protected and the unprotected. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1954.68s)]
*  And I want to read a little piece of a brilliant column [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1958.0s)]
*  that you wrote in 2016. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1961.44s)]
*  The protected make public policy, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1963.52s)]
*  and the unprotected live in it. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1966.2s)]
*  And the unprotected are starting to push back powerfully. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1968.76s)]
*  The protected are the accomplished, the secure, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1972.3600000000001s)]
*  the successful, those who have power or access to it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1974.4s)]
*  They are protected from much of the roughness of the world, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1977.88s)]
*  more to the point they are protected from the world [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1981.1200000000001s)]
*  they have created. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1983.4s)]
*  They are figures in government, politics, and media. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1985.0s)]
*  They live in nice neighborhoods, in safe ones. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1987.4s)]
*  Because they are protected, they feel [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1990.1599999999999s)]
*  they can do pretty much anything, impose any reality. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1992.32s)]
*  They're insulated, and this is what Rob Henderson calls [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1996.04s)]
*  the luxury beliefs. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=1998.6s)]
*  They're insulated from many of the effects [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2000.04s)]
*  of their own decisions you write. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2001.76s)]
*  The attitude of the top half, the protected, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2003.6s)]
*  is you're on your own. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2006.1599999999999s)]
*  Get with the program, little racists. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2008.1999999999998s)]
*  Social philosophers are always saying the underclass [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2010.76s)]
*  must remoralize. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2015.0s)]
*  But maybe it is the overclass that must remoralize. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2016.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't know if the protected see how serious this moment is [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2020.0s)]
*  or their role in it. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2023.76s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2026.04s)]
*  Is this election the ultimate repudiation [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2027.68s)]
*  of that protected class or of what other people call our elite? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2031.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2036.56s)]
*  2016 was the absolute rise of the unprotected [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2037.44s)]
*  and seizing of power. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2042.12s)]
*  And by the time they had seized power, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2043.72s)]
*  they had lost so much respect for the people on top. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2045.6s)]
*  And 2024 is a serious rebuke of the protected. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2051.6s)]
*  And yet, God bless them, they don't know it. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2063.04s)]
*  They don't know it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2070.44s)]
*  They just haven't noticed. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2071.36s)]
*  It was a powerful rebuke of the media. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2073.16s)]
*  Of which I am a part, have been saying for at least five years [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2076.28s)]
*  now, don't do that. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2080.48s)]
*  Don't go with him. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2082.16s)]
*  It's the wrong path. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2083.04s)]
*  And they were saying, just this, go away. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2085.0s)]
*  I wish they understood there are more people sympathetic to people [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2091.68s)]
*  living rough lives in America and supporting Donald Trump [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2098.0s)]
*  than those people know, I believe. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2101.64s)]
*  And I understand they're supporting Trump, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2106.3599999999997s)]
*  but I wish they understood there's an old farm saying, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2108.64s)]
*  any jackass can knock down a barn, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2115.08s)]
*  but it takes a man to build one. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2117.8399999999997s)]
*  Any angry movement can say, down, tear it down. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2121.08s)]
*  But it takes real dedication and gifts and commitment [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2126.3199999999997s)]
*  and even selflessness to build one. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2131.44s)]
*  They have no sense of what it is they are going after [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2135.36s)]
*  and what will replace it. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2144.2000000000003s)]
*  And I'm very much afraid of a carelessness [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2145.88s)]
*  on the part of powerful Trump supporters [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2149.2000000000003s)]
*  that will be allowed and gleefully chuckled at [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2152.88s)]
*  by Trump and others. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2156.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2158.8s)]
*  There's a sort of, with all populist revolutions, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2159.76s)]
*  there's a tearing down feeling. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2165.6000000000004s)]
*  Boy, I'm disturbed by tearing down from the left. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2168.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't want to tear down statues. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2171.48s)]
*  I don't want to tear down historical reputations [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2174.32s)]
*  or the real reasons for America's invention and being [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2177.6400000000003s)]
*  and what it meant. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2182.48s)]
*  I hate that from the left. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2183.6400000000003s)]
*  But I got a feeling I'm going to hate the tear it down stuff [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2186.0s)]
*  that I see on the right, too. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2190.36s)]
*  This is the most beautiful and perfect segue [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2192.48s)]
*  to the title of your book. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2195.2s)]
*  I am far less literate than you, so I [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2197.0s)]
*  didn't catch the reference. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2199.0s)]
*  Would you explain to people where the title of this book [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2201.2s)]
*  comes from, and then maybe talk a little bit [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2203.6s)]
*  about what your certain idea of America is? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2205.88s)]
*  Because I feel like that idea is maybe, at least [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2209.44s)]
*  for some people, a little shrouded right now [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2212.88s)]
*  by the political events of the moment. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2215.04s)]
*  Shrouded. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2216.6s)]
*  But yeah, that's exactly it. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2217.56s)]
*  Where does the title come from? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2221.56s)]
*  The title of this book comes from the famous first sentence [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2222.8s)]
*  of the war memoirs of Charles de Gaulle, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2227.7599999999998s)]
*  which I read some time back and which is most happily [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2230.92s)]
*  translated as, all of my life, I've [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2236.24s)]
*  had a certain idea of France. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2241.12s)]
*  That struck me as such a beautiful sentence. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2244.76s)]
*  First of all, it was so de Gaulle. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2247.44s)]
*  De Gaulle was a fabulous and wonderfully legitimately [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2250.0s)]
*  conceited man who had a mystical connection to his country. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2254.6800000000003s)]
*  And you knew the moment you read it that all of his life, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2261.1200000000003s)]
*  he did have a certain idea of France, that it was good, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2264.1600000000003s)]
*  that it needed to be continued in history, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2268.7200000000003s)]
*  that it needed his labors, but also his commitment. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2273.88s)]
*  I also was struck by that sentence [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2279.84s)]
*  when I read it because I thought all of my life [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2281.7200000000003s)]
*  I've had a certain idea of America. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2284.6s)]
*  And it is very similarly that it is good, it is great, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2286.6s)]
*  it was an advancement in the history of man. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2291.32s)]
*  It is a project we must continue, full stop. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2294.84s)]
*  Part of what I try to do for a living now [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2300.04s)]
*  is, in a funny way, I feel almost beyond partisanship. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2303.24s)]
*  I don't really care if it's Dems or reps, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2307.96s)]
*  but I care very much about America continuing, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2310.96s)]
*  about Americans in a very bad day, if a very bad day comes, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2315.3599999999997s)]
*  being able to hold together. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2321.12s)]
*  And I feel very strongly about kids in America who, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2323.3199999999997s)]
*  when I was a kid, I came from a difficult and troubled family. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2330.56s)]
*  But partly through the great movies of America, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2340.08s)]
*  I got this impression that America itself [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2343.56s)]
*  was a really good, nice place. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2346.84s)]
*  And I felt when I opened the door of my house [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2349.64s)]
*  to go out into America, I was going into a good place. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2352.56s)]
*  It kind of gave me a break, a healthy place. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2357.84s)]
*  I mean this seriously. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2360.44s)]
*  I feel now that kids from very harrowing families, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2362.08s)]
*  and boy, we're not making fewer harrowing families with kids [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2368.8s)]
*  growing up in them in America, I fear [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2374.04s)]
*  that those kids get a dark sense of life from the family [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2376.6s)]
*  and then open the door and have no sense that some relief comes [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2381.12s)]
*  from the outside, because they're [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2385.68s)]
*  joining an unjust country, one that is slightly [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2387.6s)]
*  obsessed with its sins and that reads its own history [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2392.0s)]
*  without a respect for it. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2396.52s)]
*  And so I worry about kids going into this country. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2398.92s)]
*  So I'm always sort of trying to push back [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2403.56s)]
*  a little bit against that. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2406.24s)]
*  One of the themes that courses through all of your work [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2408.7999999999997s)]
*  and so many of the essays in this book is gratitude. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2412.04s)]
*  And maybe you've already answered the question, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2415.52s)]
*  but where does that come from in you? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2417.48s)]
*  It's really gratitude and your own faith [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2420.8s)]
*  are two things that come through in so much of your, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2422.92s)]
*  I think, your best writing here. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2426.16s)]
*  Talk to me about those virtues and where they come from. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2428.88s)]
*  Well, faith is a blessing. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2436.0s)]
*  You're lucky to have it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2437.28s)]
*  You're blessed. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2438.44s)]
*  Gratitude, I don't know, just seems to me realistic. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2439.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2444.2s)]
*  If you work hard and you are rewarded for it, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2446.16s)]
*  if you've had some of the blows of life, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2450.72s)]
*  but many of the fortunate strokes of life, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2453.16s)]
*  you want to feel a lot of gratitude. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2459.6s)]
*  You just should. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2461.96s)]
*  And you ought to love the other humans. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2465.44s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2468.6s)]
*  I feel great affection for people, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2470.96s)]
*  and I think we all should. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2473.48s)]
*  But there's this, to me, if you think about, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2475.48s)]
*  in a positive way, a kind of itchiness for progress [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2479.76s)]
*  as being typical of the liberal ethos, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2483.16s)]
*  I think gratitude for the past is [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2486.32s)]
*  essential to the small c conservative ethos. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2491.32s)]
*  You write this in the book. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2494.16s)]
*  True conservatives, I think of which there are very few [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2495.96s)]
*  right now, tend to have a particular understanding [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2498.96s)]
*  of the fragility of things. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2501.88s)]
*  They understand that every human institution is, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2503.84s)]
*  in its way, built on sand. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2506.32s)]
*  It's also frail. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2508.76s)]
*  They see how thin the veil is between civilization and chaos [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2510.5600000000004s)]
*  and understand that we have to go through every day, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2514.5600000000004s)]
*  each in our own way, trying to make the veil thicker. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2516.88s)]
*  It's just the most perfect, I think, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2520.6800000000003s)]
*  encapsulation of that ethos. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2522.84s)]
*  I know you're shocked you wrote that. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2525.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2526.52s)]
*  I really like it. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2527.44s)]
*  That's good. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2529.84s)]
*  You're like, that's damn good. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2530.76s)]
*  I hope someone paid you for that. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2533.16s)]
*  You know what's one of the nice things [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2534.56s)]
*  about doing a collection? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2536.12s)]
*  You can go back through 400 columns and think, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2538.08s)]
*  you know how we're all haunted by the idea of wasted time? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2543.12s)]
*  Yeah, that we didn't accomplish enough or do enough [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2547.16s)]
*  or make the best use of the time. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2549.8399999999997s)]
*  When you go over a collection of the work you've been doing, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2552.04s)]
*  you actually feel, oh, I didn't waste that much time. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2555.64s)]
*  You feel, oh, my gosh, I was productive enough. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2560.52s)]
*  You feel kind of good about it. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2563.08s)]
*  You write in this book about your relationship [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2565.72s)]
*  with your great aunt, Jane Jane, who came here from Ireland [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2568.08s)]
*  and worked as a maid on Park Avenue. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2571.24s)]
*  And her life was very difficult. But this [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2573.4s)]
*  is what you write about her. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2575.56s)]
*  She gave me a sense of the romance of life, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2576.88s)]
*  the romance of politics and history, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2580.0s)]
*  the sense that history is a big thing and has glory in it, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2582.6s)]
*  great causes, acts of valor. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2585.7599999999998s)]
*  And she was in love with America because it [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2587.84s)]
*  could be the stage of the love and the valor. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2590.48s)]
*  America reminds you, life is dynamic, not static. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2593.76s)]
*  It moves. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2596.6800000000003s)]
*  And there's something magical in this. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2597.84s)]
*  Do you still feel that way? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2600.6800000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2602.1200000000003s)]
*  I said those words. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2604.56s)]
*  I was the main speaker at the Al Smith dinner two years ago. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2607.76s)]
*  It was a great honor. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2611.52s)]
*  And it ruined two months of my life [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2613.44s)]
*  because that's how long it took to work on this speech [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2615.12s)]
*  while I was doing other stuff. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2618.12s)]
*  But it was a great honor. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2620.08s)]
*  And I seized on this thought. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2622.12s)]
*  The dinner was being held at the Park Avenue Armory [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2626.08s)]
*  that year, two years ago. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2632.4s)]
*  And the Park Avenue Armory in the 60s [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2634.44s)]
*  was just a few blocks from where my great aunt, Jane Jane, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2638.92s)]
*  had worked as a maid. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2643.84s)]
*  And she had gone to a local church [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2645.92s)]
*  that I go to in the 60s. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2649.04s)]
*  And she had been such a humble person, the person [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2651.36s)]
*  I wrote of there. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2654.6400000000003s)]

*  that she learned in a great house. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2663.4s)]
*  And I just wanted to talk about her. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2665.84s)]
*  And I said to the people, you're passing these people [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2667.84s)]
*  on the street every day. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2670.88s)]
*  And let me tell you how optimistic she felt about America. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2673.08s)]
*  And look at me being here, coming from her family [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2681.2s)]
*  and talking to all of you. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2684.6s)]
*  It was a great night. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2686.44s)]
*  Well, we talked a little baseball and other things. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2691.72s)]
*  But it was kind of dreamy. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2694.48s)]
*  I love it when life is a little dreamy. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2696.44s)]

*  for the New York Public Library. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2714.32s)]

*  And we support our libraries. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2717.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I took part in this fundraiser. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2719.76s)]
*  And I walked in. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2723.36s)]
*  It was a glamorous event, I think held at the library, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2724.48s)]
*  if I'm remembering correctly, yes. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2729.72s)]
*  So they closed down the public library. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2732.08s)]
*  And they lit it up beautifully. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2734.0s)]
*  And they turned it into a cocktail space and a dinner [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2735.68s)]
*  space. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2738.52s)]

*  It was beautiful. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2743.7999999999997s)]

*  into the burbling cocktail area. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2748.24s)]
*  And over on the side, I saw Tom Wolfe in his suit, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2751.3599999999997s)]
*  in his white suit, and his beautiful wife. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2756.8799999999997s)]
*  Sheila. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2759.56s)]

*  and went to them, and kissed them hello, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2763.7599999999998s)]
*  and chatted with them for a moment. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2766.2799999999997s)]
*  And Tom was funny. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2769.12s)]
*  And Sheila was so charming. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2770.72s)]
*  She's so warm and deft with people. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2772.82s)]
*  And Tom talked about everything, Trump and politics and TV. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2776.82s)]
*  And then we all said goodbye, for dinner was being called. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2782.48s)]
*  And I walked towards a clump of people. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2786.8s)]
*  And they were all chattering with each other. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2789.76s)]
*  And I said, turn around and look at that man. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=2792.96s)]

*  I really do try to get a sense of what people are chatting [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3021.26s)]
*  about. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3024.82s)]
*  And you get a sense of what's true and what's not true [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3025.34s)]
*  through other people thinking aloud. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3029.06s)]
*  OK, few last questions. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3031.06s)]
*  Lightning. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3032.46s)]
*  Best thing about wasps. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3032.98s)]
*  Best thing about wasps? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3034.98s)]
*  Not the insect. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3036.98s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3037.98s)]
*  What's the best thing about wasps? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3040.98s)]
*  They had rules of life that still pertain and are still [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3045.26s)]
*  helpful. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3053.46s)]
*  Well, I could go on. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3056.5800000000004s)]
*  But I was once with a gentleman who would qualify [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3057.6200000000003s)]
*  as a high wasp fellow. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3061.6200000000003s)]
*  And we were at a party. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3064.6600000000003s)]
*  And a woman walked up and said something rather rude to me [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3066.34s)]
*  and then was rude again. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3070.3s)]
*  And I just wasn't having her guff. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3072.54s)]
*  And I answered her point for point and felt. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3075.3s)]
*  And then she left. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3078.7s)]
*  And I felt obscurely defeated as if I'd done something wrong. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3079.58s)]
*  But I couldn't tell what it was. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3084.38s)]
*  And so I turned to my friend. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3086.9s)]
*  And I said, John, you know how to do what I just [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3088.38s)]
*  didn't do right. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3091.82s)]
*  What would you have said? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3093.98s)]
*  And he said, oh, I would have raised my brows and said, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3096.2599999999998s)]
*  how extraordinary. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3100.62s)]
*  Honey, only a wasp can teach you that. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3104.58s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3107.3399999999997s)]
*  Nellie was so right. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3108.5s)]
*  Nellie calls it debutanting and tells me [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3109.94s)]
*  I need to learn how to do it. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3112.66s)]
*  Peggy, what's the best thing about Jews? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3114.2999999999997s)]
*  Best thing about Jews? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3116.9s)]
*  Warmth, family, family. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3119.58s)]
*  Jews and Italians are the same people. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3122.7799999999997s)]
*  And they don't know it. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3125.18s)]
*  It's all warm. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3126.22s)]
*  We do know it. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3126.74s)]
*  And family and food and closeness. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3127.38s)]
*  Best thing about New York. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3130.98s)]
*  It's lightning round. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3132.42s)]
*  Best thing about New York. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3133.1800000000003s)]
*  You love New York. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3136.6600000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3137.78s)]
*  In New York, you are never lonely [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3138.7400000000002s)]
*  because it is a concentrated place where [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3141.62s)]
*  the people live close. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3144.02s)]
*  And they're happy to be there. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3145.82s)]
*  And if you're feeling lonely, you [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3147.78s)]
*  can walk the streets and see the other people [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3149.7400000000002s)]
*  and actually talk to them. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3152.6600000000003s)]
*  It has a beautiful park. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3154.34s)]
*  It has beautiful boroughs. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3155.86s)]
*  It is alive. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3157.6600000000003s)]
*  And we got to keep it alive. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3158.98s)]
*  And that'll be a job in the future. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3160.94s)]
*  How do you take your coffee? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3163.3s)]
*  I take my coffee with milk and real sugar. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3164.82s)]
*  Two sugars and lots of regular milk. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3168.1800000000003s)]
*  Classic. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3171.7400000000002s)]
*  What is your deli order? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3172.5s)]
*  Deli order? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3174.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3175.82s)]
*  Oh, deli order. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3177.7400000000002s)]
*  I believe a deli order should be, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3181.34s)]
*  it's 8.48, and you should ask for scrambled eggs and sausage [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3184.38s)]
*  on a roll. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3190.78s)]
*  And they wrap it up in that silver paper, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3192.06s)]
*  and you take it away. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3195.1s)]
*  And then you eat it while having a paper cup of coffee, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3196.6600000000003s)]
*  and you feel very happy. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3201.38s)]
*  I love you, Peggy. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3204.82s)]
*  Last few. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3207.26s)]
*  Favorite guilty pleasure. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3208.38s)]
*  Or what is your guilty pleasure? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3209.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, I can tell you right away. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3211.26s)]
*  It's Haagen-Dazs ice cream. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3212.62s)]
*  It's vanilla. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3215.3s)]
*  It's vanilla Haagen-Dazs ice cream. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3216.3s)]
*  And I experiment on Amazon with getting exotic caramel sauces. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3218.82s)]
*  And when I'm having a hard day, I actually really think it's OK, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3225.7400000000002s)]
*  because at 9.30 tonight, I'm going to have vanilla Haagen-Dazs ice [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3229.3s)]
*  cream with caramel sauce. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3233.1400000000003s)]
*  And you're going to deserve it. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3234.38s)]
*  You predicted Taylor Swift would be the person of the year [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3235.54s)]
*  a little while ago. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3238.6200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3239.5s)]
*  Who should this year's person of the year be? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3239.98s)]
*  You know who it's going to be. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3242.2200000000003s)]
*  A man who's had either the biggest comeback [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3243.82s)]
*  in American political history, Donald Trump, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3247.86s)]
*  or the second biggest comeback since Richard Nixon in 1968. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3250.34s)]
*  But there's no way it won't be Trump. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3255.98s)]
*  And I wonder what journalists are [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3257.94s)]
*  going to do to find new depths of his psyche, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3259.46s)]
*  to plumb new depths. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3262.5s)]
*  I mean, haven't we done this for 10 years now? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3264.6600000000003s)]
*  Haven't we read Maggie Haberman's book? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3267.94s)]
*  Don't we know what that is? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3271.1000000000004s)]
*  So it's going to drive profilers crazy. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3273.3s)]
*  And one of the great things about political figures [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3277.34s)]
*  is that rightly, rightly, rightly, most of them [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3279.6200000000003s)]
*  protect their zone of privacy by not letting too many reporters [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3283.3s)]
*  get too close and ask too many questions. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3289.7000000000003s)]
*  They don't want to share their inner psyche, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3293.1400000000003s)]
*  their inner wounds, their joys. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3296.2200000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump will. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3300.22s)]
*  His favorite thing is to talk to reporters, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3303.1s)]
*  and very often about himself. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3306.06s)]
*  Somebody said to me recently, but he never goes deep. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3309.58s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3312.74s)]
*  He goes to the very bottom of Donald Trump. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3313.4599999999996s)]
*  Now that's not deep, but he shows you [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3316.8199999999997s)]
*  everything that is there. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3319.8999999999996s)]
*  To me, he hides nothing. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3322.9399999999996s)]
*  Peggy Noonan, thank you so much for making [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3326.3799999999997s)]
*  the time, and thank you all so much for being here. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3329.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGSAdn4tkI&t=3332.14s)]
