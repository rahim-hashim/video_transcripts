You may have never heard of Sarah Wynn-Williams, but that’s about to change.

She’s written a memoir about her nearly seven years at Facebook, the company that has since rebranded as Meta. In doing so, she’s become the company’s highest-ranking whistleblower.

Until around 72 hours ago, the book’s existence itself was a secret. Wynn-Williams, a onetime New Zealand diplomat, was effectively the company’s top envoy to governments around the world. She traveled extensively with Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg—the company’s two top leaders during her time—and her experiences with them often read like pure comedy, a mix of Succession and The Office.

The book, however, is a lot more than that. It’s a shocking insider’s account of working at one of the world’s most powerful companies at the highest level, and the gap between the idealistic way it sold itself to its employees and the world.

It’s called "Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism." And it coincides with the news that Wynn-Williams has filed an SEC complaint against the company, alleging that Zuckerberg agreed to crack down on the account of a high-profile Chinese dissident living in the U.S. in the hopes that it would help convince Beijing to allow Facebook into China.

On today’s Honestly, Bari and Wynn-Williams discuss her bizarre experiences, her thoughts on the future of Facebook, the pushback she’s already received, and why she wrote this book—despite the risk of taking on a corporate behemoth like Meta.

# Meet Sarah Wynn-Williams, Facebook’s Highest-Ranking Whistleblower
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=0.0s)]
*  You've probably never heard of Sarah Wynn Williams, but I suspect that's about to change. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4.4s)]
*  Sarah's written a memoir about her more than six years at Facebook, the company that has [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=9.44s)]
*  since rebranded as Meta. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=13.8s)]
*  She's the highest level staffer to come forward as a whistleblower, and until around 72 hours [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=15.88s)]
*  ago, the book's existence was a secret. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=21.04s)]
*  A one-time New Zealand diplomat, Sarah was the company's top envoy to governments around [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=24.32s)]
*  the world. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=29.4s)]
*  She traveled extensively with people like Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, and her [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=30.4s)]
*  experience with them and other top brass at Facebook often read like seen straight out [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=34.68s)]
*  of Veep or Succession. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=39.72s)]
*  But the book is a lot more than that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=41.94s)]
*  It's an insider's account of working at one of the most powerful companies at the highest [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=43.64s)]
*  level and the gap between the idealistic way it sold itself to its employees and the world [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=48.0s)]
*  and the reality of what it actually looked like to grow at any cost. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=53.84s)]
*  The book is called Careless People, a cautionary tale of power, greed and lost idealism. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=58.12s)]
*  The memoir comes out today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=64.92s)]
*  It happens to coincide with the news that Sarah Wynn Williams has also filed an SEC [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=67.16s)]
*  complaint against the company. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=72.84s)]
*  It alleges that Mark Zuckerberg agreed to crack down on the account of a high-profile [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=74.97999999999999s)]
*  Chinese dissident living in the U.S. at the request of a ranking CCP member, all in the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  hopes that it would help Facebook enter China. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=85.84s)]
*  The book itself goes into great detail about what the company tried to do in order to get [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  into business in an authoritarian country. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=94.64s)]
*  I asked Sarah about all of that, her bizarre experiences, her thoughts on the future of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=97.68s)]
*  Facebook, the pushback she's already received, and why she wrote this book despite the risk [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  of taking on a corporate behemoth like Metta. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=108.36s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=111.28s)]
*  Sarah Wynn Williams, welcome to Honestly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=115.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm excited to be here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Really happy to have you here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=123.0s)]
*  So you have just published this memoir called Careless People, and it is a, I think it's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=124.16s)]
*  fair to say, pretty scathing critique of the time that you spent working at Facebook, both [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=130.44s)]
*  of the people you worked with, and sort of the gap between Facebook's professed mission [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  and the way it actually functioned in the world. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=141.24s)]
*  As far as I can tell, unless there's some enormous memoir I've never heard of, you're [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=144.44s)]
*  the highest ranking Facebook official employee to have ever written something like this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  One of the things that's amazing to me is that you managed to keep the book almost a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=153.84s)]
*  total secret until the past 72 hours. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  Now it's out there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=162.0s)]
*  It's all over the news. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=163.16000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, we're going to talk about the news that it's making. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  I wanted to start by just asking how you're feeling about the way it's being received. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=166.72s)]
*  I have to be honest. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=172.4s)]
*  We're speaking so early. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=174.08s)]
*  I have no idea how it's being received. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=175.76s)]
*  You're one of the first people I'm speaking with. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=178.24s)]
*  But if I go and I put your name into Google, there's news of an SEC complaint that you [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=181.32s)]
*  filed. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=186.36s)]
*  There's some talk that there could potentially be pushback from people inside Facebook. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  You're aware of all of that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=194.68s)]
*  I mean, at a high level. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=195.68s)]
*  On that latter point, I just think that is incredibly disappointing for a company that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=198.6s)]
*  prides itself on free expression. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=205.6s)]
*  You had Mark Andreessen on very recently. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  One of the first things he said to you was, I think we're in this new era. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=213.04s)]
*  He literally said, I think there are going to be many more books written that would otherwise [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  not have been written. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  To hear that response from the company that professes to be in favor of freedom of expression [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  and also a company that's made many public pronouncements about people speaking up and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=231.56s)]
*  supporting women and all of these types of things, it's disappointing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=239.32s)]
*  I really hoped that what would happen would be a focus on the issues and what needs to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  change. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  Okay, we're definitely going to talk about the issues in this conversation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=251.4s)]
*  Before we get there, I just want a little bit of table setting. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=256.08s)]
*  You spent a little more than six years at Facebook, obviously now called Metta, as director [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  of public policy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=263.64s)]
*  You left in 2017, kind of just after the election of Trump. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=265.08s)]
*  The book is coming out seven, eight years after you've left the company. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=268.92s)]
*  What is the goal of the book? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=273.6s)]
*  I think we're in this moment now where political leaders and technology CEOs are joining forces [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=276.76s)]
*  and strengthening their power and influence at the same time as we're on the cusp of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=284.76s)]
*  this new technology in AI and as we're in this changing dynamic strategic relationship [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=290.76s)]
*  with China. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  All of these things are coming together in a way where there's one winner from AI. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  What I know is not what the public knows, which is for a long time, Facebook's been [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  working hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=313.4s)]
*  Now, as we move into this new era, we need to know that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=316.52s)]
*  We need to be aware of what's gone on in order to make change and in order to understand [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=319.84s)]
*  how this is going to play out. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=326.44s)]
*  Okay, I'm putting a pin in the idea that they've been working hand in glove with the Chinese [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=328.24s)]
*  Communist Party, obviously a very explosive claim. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=332.08s)]
*  We're going to get into that because I think it's the most important part of your book. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  I want to get to that in a little bit because I think it's the most important thing in this [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=339.12s)]
*  book. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  Before we get there, let's go back in time. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  You probably feel like this is a different lifetime ago, but that was the time before [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=347.8s)]
*  you worked at Facebook. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=352.68s)]
*  This is the time when you were obsessed with working at Facebook, which is where the book [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=354.36s)]
*  opens. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  You kind of detail the pretty unbelievable, the Yiddish word would be chutzpahdik lengths [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=359.6s)]
*  that you go to, to try and convince them to hire you for a job that doesn't even exist. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  Take us back to not the Sarah Wynne Williams of 2025, second Trump presidency, the vibe [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=370.76000000000005s)]
*  shift, everything that's changed. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=377.92s)]
*  Go back in time to that person. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=379.56s)]
*  What was Facebook to you then and why did you want to work there so badly? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=382.0s)]
*  Facebook was everything to me. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=386.0s)]
*  I was in Washington, DC as a New Zealand diplomat and incredibly sort of homesick and it was [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=388.12s)]
*  a lifeline. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=396.08s)]
*  And initially I thought it was just that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=397.08s)]
*  This is very early on. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=399.24s)]
*  It was a place where people thought that you wasted time and played farm violence. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=400.62s)]
*  I have to say, it's so hard to get your head back to what the internet was back then, where [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=406.32s)]
*  it was this sort of open, so much promise. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=412.72s)]
*  I started seeing everyone coming to the same place and just all of these conversations [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=418.52s)]
*  happening that wouldn't have otherwise happened. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=423.91999999999996s)]
*  Everyone in the same time and space, everyone accessible, like all these gatekeepers being [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  pulled away. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  And I just thought, this is going to change the world. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  This is historic. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=436.88s)]
*  There's going to be a before Facebook and an after Facebook and I want in. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=437.88s)]
*  I want to be part of that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=443.32s)]
*  I want to change the world and this is the thing that is going to change the world because [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=446.4s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=451.0s)]
*  I knew it in my bones. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  I knew it in a way that I had never known anything. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=454.84s)]
*  There's an incident early on in the book where there's this earthquake that now feels like [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=459.52s)]
*  ancient history, but I remembered it instantly when you were writing about it in Christchurch [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  in New Zealand. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=470.34s)]
*  Well, why don't you talk about the way that Facebook was used by your sister then? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=471.34s)]
*  Because I think it's extremely emblematic of something that now feels like as normal [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=475.9s)]
*  as oxygen, but at the time was an enormous breakthrough. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=481.17999999999995s)]
*  So when the Christchurch earthquake happened, I mean, you forget in a natural disaster, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=484.53999999999996s)]
*  you just have no information. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=488.53999999999996s)]
*  And I learned about the earthquake when I was about to board a plane. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=490.53999999999996s)]
*  And when I got off, couldn't work. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=497.78s)]
*  Actually, I didn't even know about the earthquake. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  I got a very odd call from my sister, who I love very much. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=502.14s)]
*  She was like, I can't reach Mum and Dad. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=504.9s)]
*  I think we're going to die. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=507.18s)]
*  And sorry. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=509.82s)]
*  And I was like, oh, God. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=511.65999999999997s)]
*  And then no one could reach her. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=513.62s)]
*  There was no, all the phone lines went down. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=515.02s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=519.26s)]
*  The only place where information was, was Facebook. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=521.3s)]
*  And people were putting up like, we've seen, you know, telling everyone who they'd seen [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=525.46s)]
*  and like, there's freshwater here or there's accommodation here. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  And when there was no other sort of infrastructure and it like all that infrastructure in the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=536.5400000000001s)]
*  real world was broken, but the online infrastructure worked. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=542.46s)]
*  And after incredibly stressful hours trying to find her, she popped up a message on Facebook [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=547.38s)]
*  because she could get through saying the most terrifying experience of her life, but that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=557.06s)]
*  she was fine. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=562.58s)]
*  It was like the early parts of the book are just full of these instances that really take [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=563.58s)]
*  the reader back to this extremely idyllic time where you saw Facebook being used just [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=569.9s)]
*  in a very personal way. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=577.4599999999999s)]
*  And it felt, you know, I remember some of those early instances, I think we're around [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=579.6999999999999s)]
*  the same age and seeing like, you know, a politician join Facebook and like seeing pictures [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=583.6999999999999s)]
*  of them with their kids. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=590.26s)]
*  And now, of course, it's all curated and all of that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=592.0999999999999s)]
*  But if you go back in people's timelines on Instagram or Facebook, it's in a kind of an [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=595.14s)]
*  incredible time before people realized that it was a public brand. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  And when they were actually using it in this very, I don't want to say innocent, maybe [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=604.7s)]
*  or yeah, very innocent way. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  Very. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=613.6600000000001s)]
*  One of my favorite things is to like scroll back, not now, but when I had more time in [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=614.6600000000001s)]
*  my life was to scroll back and see the moment when people decided they were going to take [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=619.98s)]
*  their Instagram professional. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=624.5400000000001s)]
*  Like, they used to be like again, a before and after. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=625.5400000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=631.1800000000001s)]
*  People, people that are young and determined to get a job in an industry that they don't [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=633.0999999999999s)]
*  understand would do well to read the early chapters of this book, where you basically [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=638.5799999999999s)]
*  just kind of like have doors slammed in your face again and again and again. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=643.54s)]
*  And you kind of like find windows proverbially to to like jump through until ultimately they [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=647.6999999999999s)]
*  give you a job. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=653.8199999999999s)]
*  Because at the time, the idea of Facebook being involved in public policy or diplomacy [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  or politics seemed crazy. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=659.18s)]
*  It was like, what would that have to do with us? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=660.98s)]
*  Of course, now it's totally normal. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=663.86s)]
*  But you saw that and you sort of shoved your way in. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=666.26s)]
*  And without condensing the book too much, there's a lot of scenes that are sort of like [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=669.14s)]
*  an Armando Inucci show, where you're like running down the highway in Colombia without [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=677.1s)]
*  or you're in Davos with your 11 month old baby and your husband, who's a journalist, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=685.5s)]
*  kind of trying to hide the fact that you have a baby from your corporate colleagues. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=691.34s)]
*  Can you maybe either tell us one of those stories or describe to us the experience of, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=695.74s)]
*  I guess, trying to like keep up with the pace of Facebook as you're a young mom and trying [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=702.94s)]
*  to build a family and trying to also impress your bosses? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=709.1s)]
*  Explain the experience a little bit because I'm not going to do it justice, but there's [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=713.5s)]
*  more than one scene of you running without shoes on a highway in a foreign country unable [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=717.3399999999999s)]
*  to get a taxi cab. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=722.62s)]
*  That is very true. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=724.62s)]
*  I mean, just to pick up on that, in Colombia, so we were supposed to meet with the president [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=725.66s)]
*  of Colombia. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  Mark doesn't like doing meetings in the morning. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=734.86s)]
*  And that's totally fine in Silicon Valley when you're Mark Zuckerberg, right? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=738.06s)]
*  People are on your schedule, but the one type of person who has their own schedule that's [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=741.74s)]
*  not that flexible is a president or prime minister. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=747.8199999999999s)]
*  And so there's just a real clash between that Silicon Valley mentality and dealing [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=750.62s)]
*  with presidents and prime ministers. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=755.9s)]
*  And so at the time, the president of Colombia was negotiating a very difficult peace negotiation [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=757.42s)]
*  with FARC, with rebels. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=764.78s)]
*  And he's like, I really got to go to this negotiation. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=767.1s)]
*  That's quite important. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=769.5799999999999s)]
*  This is the only time I can do. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=771.1800000000001s)]
*  And on the meta side, there's a complete like, oh, no, no, like Mark doesn't get out of [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=772.3800000000001s)]
*  bed for anything. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=776.62s)]
*  And so this high stakes negotiation on when the meeting was going to happen went to the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=777.74s)]
*  point that each side canceled the meeting out of pride. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=783.98s)]
*  Anyway, we get everything sorted. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=788.7s)]
*  It's all very last minute. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=792.5400000000001s)]
*  As you say, it's that time of life where you're throwing everything in it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=794.0600000000001s)]
*  We haven't had much. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=798.22s)]
*  We haven't had any time to do briefing. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=799.0200000000001s)]
*  So I arrive in the hotel lobby to meet Mark and the delegation, give him the briefing. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=800.62s)]
*  And sort of later and later. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=806.0600000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, no, he's like making a point. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=808.78s)]
*  He's going to be late. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=810.7s)]
*  And then they're like, no, we're here. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=812.0600000000001s)]
*  Get in the security car. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=813.82s)]
*  Like we're off. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=814.86s)]
*  There's no one there. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=817.26s)]
*  It's like a scene from a movie. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=817.98s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, I'm where you say I am. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=819.26s)]
*  And where are you? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=822.3s)]
*  And extending these messages. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=824.0600000000001s)]
*  And eventually we realize that Mark and half the delegation are at one Marriott hotel. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=825.98s)]
*  And I'm at a JW Marriott on the other side of the city. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=833.82s)]
*  And the president of Columbia is expecting both of us like five minutes ago. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=837.1s)]
*  And so charge out. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=841.66s)]
*  It was just blind panic. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=846.22s)]
*  There were no taxis, no nothing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=847.66s)]
*  So I'm like, I just got to start running in the direction of the presidential palace [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=849.74s)]
*  because I just got to get closer. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=853.74s)]
*  Take off my shoes because I was in heels. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=856.7s)]
*  Eventually managed to get someone to send me a van. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=859.66s)]
*  I'm standing up in the back of this van. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=863.1800000000001s)]
*  This poor guy doesn't speak English. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=865.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm like urging him to drive illegally to get me there. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=867.02s)]
*  We charge in and there's a massive security reaction because unsurprisingly, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=870.78s)]
*  you're not supposed to charge into the presidential palace in an unmarked white van [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=876.7s)]
*  at high speed without any type of clearance. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=881.5s)]
*  I mean, that's only just one, that's just like a day in the life. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=884.5400000000001s)]
*  So let's actually explain what your job was. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=887.98s)]
*  Because now if I said to you, hey, Facebook has a lot of people [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=892.0600000000001s)]
*  that, you know, create relationships with leaders of major nation states that [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=895.98s)]
*  make sure that Facebook is abiding by the law and those like, you would be like, obviously. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=903.0200000000001s)]
*  But at the time, that was not obvious. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=907.6600000000001s)]
*  And it seems to me like the job was something like being Facebook's unofficial diplomat, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=909.98s)]
*  like creating a relationship between Facebook, which some could argue is much more powerful [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=916.38s)]
*  than many of these nation states and the leaders of states around the world and international bodies. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=921.58s)]
*  Is that kind of an accurate description? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=927.5s)]
*  Well, one of the key themes, Sarah, that runs through this book is, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=932.14s)]
*  I don't know another word for it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=936.3s)]
*  Maybe there's a more good faith word, but it's the hypocrisy, right? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=937.66s)]
*  You felt like you were signing up for a company and the company was sort of advertising themselves [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=941.66s)]
*  this way as being about idealism, as being about a mission of connecting people around the world [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=948.4599999999999s)]
*  for and the implication is not just to change the world, but like positive change around the world. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=954.9399999999999s)]
*  And there's this sort of gap between the way they advertise themselves and talk about themselves [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=959.26s)]
*  and maybe even perceive themselves and what you actually experienced. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=963.26s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about that and when you started to see it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=969.34s)]
*  So it was more of a drip, drip, drip. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=973.02s)]
*  And, you know, I came in very open hearted. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=975.18s)]
*  Maybe it's the New Zealander in me, like I may be a little bit naive [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=978.54s)]
*  because I just I believed what the company said. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=983.1s)]
*  You know, it said it was about making the world more open and connected. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=985.8199999999999s)]
*  It said it wasn't it was about achieving a social mission. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=988.9399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't it wasn't a company. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=991.66s)]
*  And I believed all of that. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=994.06s)]
*  And it sort of was these case, you know, things would happen. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=996.54s)]
*  And I would think I must have I must have misunderstood that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1002.9399999999999s)]
*  because that that decision doesn't square with what we're saying publicly [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1005.8199999999999s)]
*  or like that that decision isn't aligned with with what we say. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1010.14s)]
*  You know, our principles are we, you know, we we say that we're a company that is, you know, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1014.6999999999999s)]
*  about more speech. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1020.86s)]
*  So so each time I was like, it must be me. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1022.78s)]
*  And then over time, I was like, maybe maybe it's not me. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1027.18s)]
*  Like, maybe I am understanding that these decisions are not what we say they are. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1031.9s)]
*  One thing I was thinking about as I was reading the book is a little bit my feeling. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1040.06s)]
*  And I'm sure you remember this era when a lot of the girl bosses who had started [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1044.22s)]
*  companies like the wing or other companies that claim to have some kind of social or feminist good, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1049.58s)]
*  the way that in the sort of very morally intense years of 2018, 1920, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1056.1399999999999s)]
*  that they got ousted from their jobs. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1064.4599999999998s)]
*  And many of those companies sort of unraveled in the wake of it. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1067.4199999999998s)]
*  And I kind of remember thinking to myself back then, and I still think about it now, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1070.62s)]
*  like you never saw that kind of self-immolation at a company or a bank like J.P. Morgan or, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1075.1000000000001s)]
*  you know, any other company simply because they never tried to layer on a social mission. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1082.3000000000002s)]
*  They were like, our job is, you know, we're a corporation. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1087.5800000000002s)]
*  It's to increase shareholder value. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1089.74s)]
*  And I guess I wonder if you have any thoughts about that with regard to Facebook, like, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1091.9s)]
*  because there's one way to read this book where it's like, well, yes, Sarah, it's a company. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1097.1000000000001s)]
*  Of course, their job is to grow. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1101.66s)]
*  Of course, their job is to increase shareholder value. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1103.18s)]
*  Why did you ever think otherwise? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1106.0600000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1108.3s)]
*  It's totally fair that that is a way to read it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1110.54s)]
*  At the same time, like when I joined the company, when you got given like literally a little red [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1114.0600000000002s)]
*  book and the little red book had all of these sort of quotes from Mark, it was, you know, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1120.0600000000002s)]
*  it was very stylishly done, very like of the moment. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1126.06s)]
*  And it was all about kind of an ideology and a philosophy. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1130.22s)]
*  And it sort of said, you know, we're a Facebook family. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1134.8600000000001s)]
*  Now, I think the generation coming up after me are like so smart. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1137.1s)]
*  They're like, hmm, no, you're not my family. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1141.58s)]
*  Like, this is not a family. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1144.3s)]
*  This is a business. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1147.34s)]
*  But like, I fell for it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1148.8600000000001s)]
*  What was in the book? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1150.8600000000001s)]
*  What were some of the things that were in that red book that so intoxicated you and so many others? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1151.98s)]
*  Because it said explicitly, you know, things like we are mission oriented. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1159.98s)]
*  Our job is to make the world open and connected. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1165.98s)]
*  It had like the philosophy on perks, which is like, sure, you need, you know, there are [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1171.8200000000002s)]
*  everyday things that you need like food and laundry. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1175.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, we'll take care of that because this is more important. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1179.1s)]
*  Like, we're part of this like massive moon kind of moonshot. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1181.98s)]
*  It was it was very effective propaganda. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1186.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to I mean, that sounds like I'm trying. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1189.5s)]
*  It was also tight, you know, as an easy target audience, we were all, you know, at that stage, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1191.66s)]
*  most of the workforce was really young. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1197.1s)]
*  We didn't have families. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1199.02s)]
*  We could work around the clock. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1201.02s)]
*  The red book, Sarah, wasn't the only book that was famous at Facebook at the time. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1202.22s)]
*  I think the other book that typified this era at Facebook wasn't actually a Facebook [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1207.82s)]
*  book, but was Lean In written by Sheryl Sandberg by far and away the most powerful woman at [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1212.54s)]
*  the company and ultimately your boss. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1218.78s)]
*  There's a lot of stories that you tell about your experiences, but the scene maybe that [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1221.74s)]
*  sticks out with me the most is, you know, you're delivering your first baby and you [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1227.1799999999998s)]
*  are writing emails from the delivery bed. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1233.34s)]
*  Like most people, I'm insane. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1237.82s)]
*  I might do something like that. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1241.8999999999999s)]
*  I think most but also I'm running the running the company. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1243.1s)]
*  Take us back to the Sarah that was doing that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1247.74s)]
*  Like, why did you feel you had to do that at that moment? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1250.3s)]
*  Because I think I think it's what you've been saying, Barry, like what you just said, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1254.46s)]
*  you know, I do it because I'm running the company. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1259.02s)]
*  Like, I feel like that attitude, which was in Lean In, but which I also have a propensity [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1261.6599999999999s)]
*  of was like, I'm I'm responsible. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1267.42s)]
*  I will do this. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1269.3400000000001s)]
*  Like I am committed. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1270.22s)]
*  And I think what's really hard. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1271.9s)]
*  I mean, especially as you become a parent, but more generally is to find what the limit [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1275.5800000000002s)]
*  is on that, you know, and I'm embarrassed now. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1279.66s)]
*  Like I, you know, I didn't want to be a hypocrite. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1282.14s)]
*  So I put that I did. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1287.74s)]
*  That's uncomfortable for me to have that as public knowledge that I did that because [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1289.02s)]
*  it's incredibly humiliating now. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1293.9s)]
*  But at the time, you know, to your point where you were saying like that, the advice of like [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1297.34s)]
*  do as much as you can before you have children. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1303.1s)]
*  Like I just took that very literally. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1305.4199999999998s)]
*  Like I was like, I took that literally up until the moment of crowning. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1306.9399999999998s)]
*  When she's like, push, but like, you know, I, you know, I have this thing where I'm just [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1312.3799999999999s)]
*  like, okay, like if this is it, we'll do what does it take to get this done? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1319.26s)]
*  And I think, you know, there was a lot of stuff in that book that was really helpful, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1323.8999999999999s)]
*  but then there wasn't the limit, like the limitations on it. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1329.6599999999999s)]
*  There was like, it's very hard to navigate those edges and, you know, I'm wiser now and [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1333.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm now embarrassed, but like, I also can see how I got there. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1339.4199999999998s)]
*  And I can also see like when you're trying to build something and when you're seized [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1342.86s)]
*  of what you're doing, like you are running a company, like it's really hard to put the [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1347.98s)]
*  limit on anything. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1353.18s)]
*  The character that's sort of subtly and then sometimes not so subtly trying to tell you [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1355.5s)]
*  where the limit is, is your long suffering husband, Tom, who like, you know, is, I'm [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1360.7s)]
*  joking, maybe he is long suffering. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1367.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1369.18s)]
*  But in these moments is sort of wanting to say to you like what, like stop, you know, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1369.66s)]
*  why is he unable to get through to you? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1376.38s)]
*  Do you think in so many of them? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1378.3s)]
*  I mean, he would love to answer this question, I think. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1380.5400000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1383.5800000000002s)]
*  But I think, I think it's, he's learned over the years, like I have to learn these lessons, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1384.5400000000002s)]
*  you know, through, through living it and through getting it wrong and then through [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1394.6200000000001s)]
*  doing better next time. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1399.02s)]
*  He does usually have good advice, I'll grudgingly admit, and it's, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1402.38s)]
*  but it's often hard for me to hear it. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1408.8600000000001s)]
*  The scene that might get the most attention, I've seen that it's been mentioned already [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1411.74s)]
*  in some reviews of the book, is when you're pregnant on the plane, coming back from Davos, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1416.14s)]
*  I believe it is, I think you're pregnant with your second child. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1422.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and been a really complicated pregnancy. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1425.74s)]
*  Well, why don't you tell the story of what happens on that plane? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1428.7800000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1432.3000000000002s)]
*  So we were flying back and churning through work as we did. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1432.62s)]
*  And at a certain point, so in, I'll explain this because this was new to me, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1438.86s)]
*  and I wish someone had explained this to me, but in a private jet, often there are bedrooms [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1445.26s)]
*  in the back of the private jet, not bedrooms, like there aren't, not for everyone, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1449.8999999999999s)]
*  there's a bedroom with a proper bed. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1455.34s)]
*  And Cheryl went back to sleep and then came out and said, you know, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1458.0600000000002s)]
*  Sarah, you should come into bed. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1467.98s)]
*  And I was like, no, no, no, thank you, I have lots of work to churn through. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1471.5s)]
*  And she's like, no, no, you should come into bed. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1476.8600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, my, I mean, I had many thoughts, but one is like, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1481.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't think anything good comes of getting into bed with any boss. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1486.3s)]
*  So it wasn't something I felt comfortable doing. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1492.3s)]
*  I read that scene candidly and I thought I could see myself doing something like this. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1496.94s)]
*  And here's what I mean. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1502.46s)]
*  I could see myself being with a bunch of female colleagues and knowing that one is [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1504.3799999999999s)]
*  especially exhausted because she's seven months pregnant and saying, like, take the bed, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1512.06s)]
*  like, take the bed. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1519.42s)]
*  But that is not how you heard it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1521.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1523.1s)]
*  If it had been an offer of just a bed, that's a very different offer. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1523.66s)]
*  And also, I mean, there are other things happening around me that made me concerned that [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1530.14s)]
*  I would be put in a vulnerable position. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1538.14s)]
*  And so I chose not to. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1541.0200000000002s)]
*  But, you know, I feel like a lot of the book is about navigating these hard choices where [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1543.0200000000002s)]
*  there isn't a roadmap and there's sort of a fork in the road. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1552.5400000000002s)]
*  And over time, I think you get better at having an instinct of when things could go very badly [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1557.5800000000002s)]
*  wrong. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1564.5400000000002s)]
*  But, you know, it's hard. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1564.94s)]
*  But I also think maybe a theme here is, you know, you get a book when you join a company [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1567.18s)]
*  saying this is the Facebook family. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1573.1000000000001s)]
*  And already with that word, and, you know, when you're working so hard, you know, there [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1575.98s)]
*  is a kind of erasure of boundaries because you're working, you're spending just so much [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1581.74s)]
*  time with people. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1588.7s)]
*  And inevitably, you're talking about things that are not like exactly what work is about, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1590.0600000000002s)]
*  not intentionally, but it's just like you're bonded to these people. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1596.62s)]
*  You're arguably spending more time with them in the early days of something than you are [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1600.3s)]
*  with your own family. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1604.46s)]
*  And I think for a lot of young people, before you do have a family, that can be extremely [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1606.62s)]
*  gratifying and rewarding. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1610.3799999999999s)]
*  When did you start to feel like, wait, the boundarylessness of this, which maybe felt [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1613.58s)]
*  really exciting in the beginning, feels really bad? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1617.8999999999999s)]
*  So I think that's true. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1621.26s)]
*  And as you say, it's like many workplaces. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1622.6999999999998s)]
*  It's, you know, newsrooms. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1624.78s)]
*  It's, you know, when people have to travel for work, it's all of those types of environments. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1626.2199999999998s)]
*  And I think you sort of start to get a spidey sense of like, this isn't right. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1630.6999999999998s)]
*  This isn't normal. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1638.06s)]
*  This is overset. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1639.1s)]
*  But often the problem is that these things happen in really subtle ways. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1640.3s)]
*  You're sort of the frog in the boiling water. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1645.58s)]
*  You don't realize how your environment has changed. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1647.4199999999998s)]
*  And I think for me, certainly, I was just a little too slow. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1655.4199999999998s)]
*  And also, it's very hard to insist on not going with what's going on. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1659.5s)]
*  Like, if you're a social person, you like being with people. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1667.1799999999998s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1670.62s)]
*  I feel like it's a challenge in many different intense workplaces. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1671.4199999999998s)]
*  So there's a bunch of stories you include that I think will make some people cringe, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1677.4199999999998s)]
*  but, you know, are unclear if they're just, you know, people reading a situation differently. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1682.54s)]
*  The one that is a real allegation is the allegation you bring regarding Joel Kaplan. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1688.22s)]
*  There's a few instances, one in which you claim he is grinding against you on a dance floor, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1695.6599999999999s)]
*  that he's making word comments about your husband, that he takes Zoom calls from bed. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1701.1s)]
*  One of your superiors, a guy called Elliot Schrag, he put out a statement on the occasion of the [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1706.3s)]
*  publication of your book saying that he took your claim seriously at the time, but ultimately, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1711.98s)]
*  a Facebook investigation, an HR investigation, found that your allegations weren't substantiated. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1717.82s)]
*  And he also says, and this is the closing line of his statement, and it's pretty devastating, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1724.14s)]
*  he says that you're an unreliable narrator. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1729.66s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1732.62s)]
*  I mean, there is more, as I understand it, to that statement. I think he said that there was [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1734.6200000000001s)]
*  an investigation, a false claim, and a termination. And what they don't say is that the investigation [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1742.14s)]
*  was the investigation that I triggered into Joel. Just, again, I had tried to resolve this in lots [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1750.46s)]
*  of different ways. And I think one of the things that's really disappointing is this, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1757.74s)]
*  the way that the company is trying to misrepresent that and make it look like it was an investigation, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1768.0600000000002s)]
*  and to me, rather than telling the truth. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1772.3000000000002s)]
*  In a second, I want to talk about China, which to me is the most important part of this book. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1776.6200000000001s)]
*  And you could argue reading it, like, wow, this is really, really important. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1780.7s)]
*  And a lot of the salacious stories about other personnel at Facebook, you could argue sort of [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1786.86s)]
*  detract from what is, to me, the beating heart of the book, which is the way Facebook, with its [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1794.22s)]
*  aim to grow, is sort of compromising or trying to compromise with really authoritarian countries. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1801.34s)]
*  What do you say to that? Why include these other stories that some would argue could detract or [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1808.86s)]
*  distract? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1813.82s)]
*  It's a really good point, and it is something that I really grappled with. But how you do [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1814.38s)]
*  something is, in many cases, how you do everything. And I think there are a lot of really small [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1821.3400000000001s)]
*  stories in the book as well, like, you know, the fact that I was surprised that Silicon Valley was [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1829.2600000000002s)]
*  awash in wooden Montessori toys rather than high tech, you know, gadgets. So the fact that so many [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1834.22s)]
*  of these executives at social networks ban their teenagers from being on said social networks. So [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1841.02s)]
*  I wanted to include everything, even when it wasn't flattering to me, because I also want [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1848.1399999999999s)]
*  people who read this to trust that, you know, it's a truthful account. And I think seeing those, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1857.18s)]
*  like, moral compromises and understand the moral decision making at this company is important. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1868.14s)]
*  And to see it in these contexts helps you understand how you could get there with something [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1875.26s)]
*  like China. I don't think you can just go straight into, I don't think you can understand it in [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1880.8600000000001s)]
*  isolation. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1885.5s)]
*  Let's talk about China. So by 2014, Facebook had reached 1.3 billion active monthly users. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1886.38s)]
*  And as we've discussed, it's a company. The goal is to grow, to increase shareholder value. And [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1896.14s)]
*  the way to do that, it became clear, was to get to more countries, including some countries that [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1901.82s)]
*  are hostile to the very things that Facebook's mission is about. Connectivity, transparency. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1908.3s)]
*  These are countries that are hostile to basic liberties and, of course, human rights. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1915.18s)]
*  And here's what you write. You say, I watched hopelessly as they sucked up to authoritarian [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1919.9s)]
*  regimes like China's and casually misled the public. Tell us about what you mean by that. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1924.86s)]
*  And then we're going to get into some of the details of China. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1932.3799999999999s)]
*  Sure. So the standard line that the company has always given is that they were studying [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1935.6599999999999s)]
*  and learning China. The Chinese market today, to matter, is worth $18 billion. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1943.26s)]
*  If you look at their most recent 10k filing, which is, you know, they say the Chinese market [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1952.22s)]
*  is worth $18 billion. Two years ago, that was $7 billion. So this company, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1957.66s)]
*  its current valuation and its future growth are both completely dependent on China. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1966.3s)]
*  And for some reason, some reason being that the company has not been upfront about its operations, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1973.34s)]
*  people don't understand that. And if they don't understand that, they don't understand the trade [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1978.78s)]
*  offs and the actual orientation of the company. And they've done a wonderful job of letting [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1983.66s)]
*  this idea that they're, you know, they have no engagement at China take hold when that's not the [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1990.46s)]
*  truth. Okay. In 2014, and this email is included in the book, Mark sends an email to Zuckerberg [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=1995.74s)]
*  explaining what he views as the company's three-year plan to have Facebook fully [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2004.06s)]
*  operational in China. And here's just part of what that email said. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2009.1s)]
*  I wanted to provide some context on why I believe it is time to take this more seriously [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2012.6200000000001s)]
*  in our mission to connect the world. There have always been a few difficult problems. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2017.5s)]
*  We've always said we'd get to eventually connecting those who can't afford the internet, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2020.94s)]
*  building satellites for those who don't have any connectivity and connecting countries where we're [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2024.78s)]
*  blocked like China. We've now made progress on every single other major problem. And the last [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2029.5s)]
*  one on the list is China. By the end of year three, we should have hopefully built the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2034.54s)]
*  relationships that would enable Facebook to operate in China as well. And you say that [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2039.34s)]
*  there's a lot that's missing in Mark's email. Things like acknowledgement of the moral complexity, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2044.7s)]
*  this is you, of working in an authoritarian country. There's no question in Mark's email of, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2051.42s)]
*  should we operate in China or how do we manage the inevitable moral dilemmas that are sure to come? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2056.46s)]
*  China is, in Mark's eyes, just the end of a to-do list. Help us get into the mind of [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2062.38s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg at the time. Do you think that it's just naivete? Do you think that it's callousness? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2070.62s)]
*  How do you understand the psychology of the person that is writing this email for the three-year plan [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2079.18s)]
*  in China? Because I don't think Facebook is at all unique in this regard. I think that there are many, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2088.7s)]
*  many, many companies throughout Silicon Valley and certainly throughout America that are writing [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2094.54s)]
*  similar things at the time. Take us into their mindset. How do you understand [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2100.78s)]
*  why what's missing from that email is missing? So the way that I experienced Mark was that he looks [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2108.78s)]
*  at the world as if it's a board game, like it's a game of risk, as if he's an emperor of a board [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2115.9s)]
*  game and there's this giant piece missing. And it becomes his white whale. It becomes the one thing [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2121.1800000000003s)]
*  that he hasn't been able to make work. And the one thing that he knows would fundamentally change [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2128.22s)]
*  the trajectory of his business. The scandal here and what you catalogue in the book is the various [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2134.54s)]
*  ways that Facebook considered appeasing the CCP so that Facebook could enter China. There are a lot [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2141.5s)]
*  of details in the book, some of which are frankly a little bit labyrinthine so people should read it. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2149.4199999999996s)]
*  But let me try and summarise the key points. You allege that Facebook was willing to store [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2156.22s)]
*  user data in China. You allege that they were willing to hand over this data to the CCP, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2161.9s)]
*  including for users in Hong Kong, which was not under Chinese control at the time. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2166.94s)]
*  You allege that they were willing to put in place a chief editor to decide what could stay up, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2171.9s)]
*  like what was kosher and what wasn't. You allege that they were willing to conduct [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2177.2599999999998s)]
*  surveillance through a Chinese partner on the ground and willing to shut down the site during [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2181.58s)]
*  times of quote social unrest. I just want to read, I want the listener to understand some of the [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2187.42s)]
*  specific offerings that were up for consideration or at least were being discussed within Facebook [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2194.54s)]
*  that you write about in your book. So bear with me because they're your words. It's weird to have [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2201.5s)]
*  them read back to you but I think it's useful for people listening to this. Under direction from Mark, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2206.06s)]
*  Facebook assembled a large team, including some of its most senior and respected engineers, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2211.26s)]
*  to work up what the Chinese Communist Party wanted. They started building new censorship tools [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2216.78s)]
*  for Hony, and this is sort of their partner on the ground, to scour through people's messages [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2222.46s)]
*  messages and posts and convert everything into simplified Chinese. Here's more. Facebook would [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2227.26s)]
*  build facial recognition, photo tagging and other moderation tools to facilitate Chinese censorship. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2233.34s)]
*  The tools would enable Facebook's partner on the ground, Hony, and the Chinese government to [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2239.74s)]
*  review all the public posts and private messages of Chinese users, including messages they get from [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2244.62s)]
*  users outside China. Here's the last one. There would be an emergency switch to block any specific [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2250.7s)]
*  region in China from interacting with Chinese and non-Chinese users. Also, an extreme emergency [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2257.58s)]
*  content switch to remove viral content originating inside or outside China during times of potential [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2265.1s)]
*  unrest, including significant anniversaries like the anniversary of Tiananmen Square. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2271.74s)]
*  Their censorship tools would automatically examine any content with more than 10,000 views by Chinese [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2277.18s)]
*  users. Once this virality counter got built, the documents say that Facebook deployed it in Hong [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2283.02s)]
*  Kong and Taiwan where it's been running on every post. So what you're essentially describing here [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2288.86s)]
*  is like a scenario where Facebook is actively building censorship tools tailored to the demands [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2294.38s)]
*  of the CCP. Right. And even more to the point, the CCP were testing Facebook on these tools. So [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2301.1s)]
*  when any other government, including the US government, would say, hey, how does facial [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2312.1400000000003s)]
*  recognition work or how does photo tagging work? I would have these conversations with other [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2317.26s)]
*  governments. We'd say, sorry, we can't tell you that. That's information that's only for us. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2322.3s)]
*  We're not going to sit you down and explain to you how Facebook Live works or how photo tagging works. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2327.9s)]
*  And yet for the CCP, there were these detailed briefings showing how the technology worked, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2334.2200000000003s)]
*  testing of it to make sure it met their censorship specifications. And beyond that, there were sort of [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2343.1000000000004s)]
*  general briefings on AI or infrastructure, the sort of things that would never be provided to [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2351.18s)]
*  any other government. Are you suggesting that the CCP could sort of use these tools on non-Facebook [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2357.2599999999998s)]
*  products or simply that Facebook was sort of being very open kimono with the Chinese government? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2364.22s)]
*  They were explaining exactly how this technology worked, which was being built in a white glove [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2371.3399999999997s)]
*  service for the CCP. How many people inside Facebook knew about the development of these [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2379.82s)]
*  kinds of tools or knew about the kind of dialogue that was happening between the CCP and Facebook? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2387.6600000000003s)]
*  It's a really interesting question. Again, they weren't upfront with the vast majority of employees. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2395.42s)]
*  I think if you're someone who works at a company like this, that's not great. Like, you shouldn't [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2400.86s)]
*  feel great about the company holding back its top priority from its employees. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2406.14s)]
*  For those that did know about this and did know about Facebook's aims to get into the Chinese [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2412.7799999999997s)]
*  market, how was it discussed among those people? Like, you know, you're making the case in the book [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2418.14s)]
*  to be crude about it, that Facebook was actively strengthening a surveillance state [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2425.18s)]
*  in order to get, you know, purchase in that market. But presumably that's not the way it [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2429.98s)]
*  was being talked about. How was it being justified and discussed? It was being discussed as sort of [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2435.82s)]
*  this, you know, I think the vast majority of people working on it thought it was like a high [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2442.38s)]
*  priority project, you know, something the CEO wants. So I think there was sort of a lot of, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2448.06s)]
*  most people got excited about it and felt like they were in on a secret and in on a CEO's top [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2455.5s)]
*  priority. That was my sense of it. Would the steelman argument of it be something like, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2462.06s)]
*  look, China is obviously an authoritarian regime. It's obviously, you know, an extraordinarily [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2468.86s)]
*  different country than America and not one any of us would choose, a regime any of us at Facebook [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2477.02s)]
*  would choose to live under, but better they have a tool like Facebook, which allows a level of [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2482.86s)]
*  connectivity than not having anything at all. In other words, was there a way that they justified [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2488.46s)]
*  it to themselves based on essentially, I don't want to say human rights grounds, but the argument [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2493.9s)]
*  that better to have this tool than nothing at all. But I think if you take that the next step, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2499.66s)]
*  so there was knowledge at the company because someone had to actually implement this, like [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2505.02s)]
*  someone actually had to execute on the censorship tool. And when they considered that, you know, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2511.02s)]
*  they weigh the leadership, weigh the pros and cons and list out like, you know, the pros of us [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2518.2999999999997s)]
*  operating this, you know, and they're like, you know, more direct communication with the government, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2526.94s)]
*  you know, a number of other things. And when it gets to the cons, they're like, they know that [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2532.06s)]
*  the first is one of the most extraordinary Microsoft Office track changes I've ever seen [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2537.5s)]
*  in my life. But like the original drafting was, you know, we would be responsible for torture, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2543.66s)]
*  you know, death. And then there's a track change. And then it's like, we would be responsible for [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2550.14s)]
*  working with a country that does not respect international human rights. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2556.14s)]
*  I just want to be really clear here for the listener and for the people who certainly have [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2559.98s)]
*  not read your book because it comes out today. Facebook in this context is not in China. They [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2564.22s)]
*  are internally weighing the decision about whether or not they should enter China. And so the [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2569.58s)]
*  document you're referring to is a document you come across where Facebook's China team is basically [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2575.66s)]
*  talking out loud to themselves. They are weighing the pros and cons of what it would mean for [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2582.06s)]
*  Facebook to do the surveillance on behalf of China themselves. And one of the cons that's listed in [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2587.8199999999997s)]
*  that document is, quote, Facebook employees will be responsible for user data responses [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2593.98s)]
*  that could lead to death, torture and incarceration. Okay, so I just want to put that in [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2599.5s)]
*  full context for the listener. You're saying that this line in a later edit, or perhaps the final [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2604.3s)]
*  edit of this document, that it changes and it becomes something much more anodyne. It then says, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2610.38s)]
*  quote, Facebook employees will be responsible for directly responding to requests for data from a [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2616.62s)]
*  government that does not respect international standards for human rights. Far less incendiary, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2621.98s)]
*  obviously, than talking about torture and death. Tell me about this line. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2627.26s)]
*  When, you know, it's easy to have sort of, as you were putting it to me, the sort of benign view of [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2636.78s)]
*  like, okay, let's do what governments need. But there are actual real world consequences to that. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2643.18s)]
*  If people are saying things that they shouldn't be saying in an authoritarian state, and they think [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2652.14s)]
*  they're saying them in private, and that information is shared in authoritarian states, you know, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2660.7s)]
*  consequences such as torture, death, as this document had, are realistic prospects. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2667.26s)]
*  Who was ultimately calling the shots on the China plans and the China proposals? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2676.22s)]
*  Ultimately, Mark. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2681.82s)]
*  And was he intimately involved in these policy proposals? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2683.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, he led, you know, it's quite public that he was going to Beijing, running through Tiananmen [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2688.6200000000003s)]
*  Square, and meeting with or trying to meet with President Xi. I mean, this stuff is in the public [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2696.1400000000003s)]
*  arena. Were other people at Facebook distressed in the way that you were? Like, was there a sort of [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2703.26s)]
*  sidebar conversation with you and anyone else about what you were seeing on China specifically? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2711.1s)]
*  I know there were on feminist issues and workplace issues, but what about China? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2717.02s)]
*  A lot less than you'd think. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2721.74s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2725.02s)]
*  I think because it was easy for the company to cloak it in a, you know, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2727.58s)]
*  white whale, you know, empire building, exciting project, all of that. I think [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2736.3s)]
*  that veneer and that sense of helping Mark build his empire [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2746.54s)]
*  sort of blinded people to a lot of the reality of what was being discussed. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2753.42s)]
*  Eventually, Mark Zuckerberg is called in front of Congress in 2018 about these issues. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2758.3s)]
*  And you claim in the book that he misled Congress. In fact, you say he lied. What does he lie about [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2765.82s)]
*  in front of Congress in your view? So he was asked about the conditions under which Facebook would [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2772.78s)]
*  enter China. And he says no decisions have been made. When in fact, hundreds of decisions have [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2781.02s)]
*  been made. But isn't there easily plausible deniability there in that he can argue we're [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2790.06s)]
*  not even in China, so no decisions have been made. I think if you look at the text of the question, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2795.82s)]
*  which again is part of what surprised me is in learning about how these [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2801.58s)]
*  congressional hearings were approached, was that there's not a sense of being up front on issues [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2808.62s)]
*  of national security and giving a full accounting to people who very reasonably, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2817.5s)]
*  Congress very reasonably wants to understand what is the situation between the US and China. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2825.18s)]
*  And it was surprising to me the ways in which the company wanted to avoid giving a full accounting. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2831.82s)]
*  So basically, the moment comes there's a Democrat from Nevada who says to Mark, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2839.02s)]
*  the Chinese government is unwilling to allow a social media platform, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2844.7s)]
*  Foreigner Domestic, to operate in China unless it agrees to abide by Chinese law. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2848.14s)]
*  First, a social media platform must agree to censor content and conversations and then it goes on and [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2853.2599999999998s)]
*  on and on. And basically, it ends with her saying, could you please reveal to the committee whether [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2857.74s)]
*  you are willing to agree to either of these requirements? And Mark's answer is ultimately, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2863.2599999999998s)]
*  we are not in a position to know exactly how the government would seek to apply its laws and [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2868.7s)]
*  regulations to the platform. Now you say that's not true. Right. But they could say, I'm just [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2873.02s)]
*  trying to like, make the strongest case for the other side of the argument, that we don't operate [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2879.9s)]
*  in China. So how could we actually know what the full requirements would be? We know broadly what [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2885.1s)]
*  they would be, but we don't operate in China. So how do we know? And what do you say to that argument? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2892.86s)]
*  So they say no decisions have been made. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2897.9s)]
*  They had full engineering teams working on the censorship product. They had constant back and [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2906.06s)]
*  forth with the CCP. Many, many decisions have been made. The day that Mark is testifying in front of [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2912.62s)]
*  Congress, you're no longer at Facebook. What was your, what do you remember your reaction being that day? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2920.3s)]
*  I was shocked. Because I thought at that point that you're in front of the people responsible [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2925.66s)]
*  for the national security of the country, you would be as, you would answer the question. And [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2937.5s)]
*  it was a surprise to learn that not even in that context. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2947.66s)]
*  Sarah, in 2019, Zuckerberg gives a speech at Georgetown that's sort of largely about the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2956.38s)]
*  importance of free speech and civil liberties. And in it, he talks about how Chinese censorship [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2962.7s)]
*  is one of the reasons, and I'm quoting him now, that we don't operate Facebook, Instagram, or [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2969.18s)]
*  other services in China. How do you understand that statement? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2974.46s)]
*  I find that statement somewhat confusing when you look at the broader picture of how [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2981.1s)]
*  Metta operates in China and the significant revenue that it takes from China. And it seems [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2989.9s)]
*  a surprising approach to just focus on that aspect and not be more upfront about the fuller relationship. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=2999.5s)]
*  So just to be totally clear again, the CCP or, you know, perhaps the more accurate way to say [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3008.54s)]
*  that is companies with ties to the CCP are purchasing Facebook advertisements. But Facebook [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3014.54s)]
*  itself, if you go to Facebook.com in China, it's not there. It never got into China. It's still not [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3021.66s)]
*  in China with Instagram or Facebook. And so you can argue, I think, pretty clearly that there was a [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3027.18s)]
*  limit on what they were willing to do to get into that country. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3033.3399999999997s)]
*  Can you though? I didn't see any limit. I didn't see any limit. There wasn't, you know, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3037.74s)]
*  torture and death wasn't a limit. I didn't see much discussions around limits. I saw a lot of [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3048.7799999999997s)]
*  discussions about opportunity and, you know, growing markets and expanding, but it didn't, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3054.54s)]
*  that wasn't the sense of the discussions. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3062.22s)]
*  Okay, in April of last year, and the Washington Post just broke this news yesterday, you filed [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3064.86s)]
*  an SEC complaint saying that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook agreed to crack down on the account of [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3071.5s)]
*  the account of a Chinese dissonant who was living in the U.S. after a high ranking Chinese official [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3079.3399999999997s)]
*  asked them to. Metta, you claim, thought that by doing so, this official would help Metta get into [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3085.98s)]
*  China. You also say in that complaint that executives, and I'm quoting now, stonewalled and [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3093.66s)]
*  provided non-responsive or misleading information to investors and American regulators. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3098.94s)]
*  I have several questions about this, but let's start with why file an SEC complaint? What is [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3104.2999999999997s)]
*  your goal in doing so? So it felt important to me to have an accounting of all of this, and I had [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3110.3799999999997s)]
*  tried when I was in the company to raise issues and concerns around this. And I had tried when I [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3122.7799999999997s)]
*  when I left the company, so I felt like one of the few avenues open to having some form of [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3133.18s)]
*  accountability for a company that is as powerful as Metta is through the Securities and Exchange [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3143.66s)]
*  Commission, who are there to look out for investors who deserve to know the truth. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3150.14s)]
*  One obvious question, you know, you're blowing the whistle in a loud way now, and you filed this SEC [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3155.98s)]
*  complaint about all the information with regard to China. You knew it at the time. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3161.98s)]
*  Some will read this and say, Sarah, if you were so opposed to this and so sort of like morally [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3169.26s)]
*  scandalized by it, why not leave immediately? Why not blow the whistle then? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3176.3s)]
*  So I think part of it was where we are, like a lot has changed in the relationship between the [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3181.82s)]
*  US and China in the last few years, but certainly since the time that I was there. And [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3187.74s)]
*  you can make lots of arguments about whether it would be helpful to know before now, but [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3198.3799999999997s)]
*  I really feel now that we're on the cusp of this new era of AI, it's critical that we understand [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3205.3399999999997s)]
*  what has gone on, what technological briefings have been shared, all of that. Now, I mean, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3214.06s)]
*  we're in a world where, you know, you've got two competing open source AI models. One, DeepSea, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3220.46s)]
*  China is built on top of, you know, with other things, but built on top of Metta's open source [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3228.7799999999997s)]
*  llama protocols. It's a time where it's now, we have to know now. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3235.9s)]
*  Spell out for people why that is. Like, why is it so important now for people that are not following [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3245.42s)]
*  the development of AI in the way that you are and I am to some extent, but certainly you are? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3252.62s)]
*  What is the urgency, you know, for the person that's just going and using chat GPT and finds [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3259.34s)]
*  that it really helps them figure out the best recipe or organizes them and they're thinking, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3264.22s)]
*  what does this China stuff have to do with me? Like, make the case why it matters to them. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3268.7s)]
*  Sure, because it's a winner takes all model, right? We're in the sort of competition to see [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3273.8999999999996s)]
*  which AI model is going to be effectively like the Google of the internet, right? And [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3280.2999999999997s)]
*  there are two different theories. One is the theory of, you know, chat GPT or Anthropic, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3287.5s)]
*  which is a closed model with a technology that underpins how it works, how it gets you the best [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3293.82s)]
*  recipe, how it plans your travel itinerary in a way you couldn't even imagine that that's not [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3299.7400000000002s)]
*  shared. The other model is the model that's being led by Metta and that's the open source [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3305.82s)]
*  like so that that puts all the technology, you know, shares a lot more of the technology [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3313.82s)]
*  and allows other people to use it. And that is what we've seen with [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3318.94s)]
*  Llama and Deepsea, which has taken that technology and then built the Chinese model on top of it. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3324.3s)]
*  And there's a lot of discussion now around, you know, in this winner take all environment, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3329.98s)]
*  because of this, is China going to be the winner? Are we going to be using a Chinese model of AI [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3336.7000000000003s)]
*  in our future because it's just going to swamp, blow all the other competitors out of the water? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3343.42s)]
*  So you're saying that the immorality or immorality that you discuss in the book [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3349.5s)]
*  is a risk because Facebook is building the AI model that they want to be the winner takes all [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3354.7000000000003s)]
*  model and that they're what you've exposed in this book, read their connection to China and [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3360.38s)]
*  their willingness to bend over backwards to appease China makes it a liability for all of us. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3366.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the statements I remember saying someone very clearly multiple times is [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3373.1s)]
*  like, you know, the Chinese love open source. Like, of course, they love having the technology [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3378.22s)]
*  available. And there are, you know, open source is great and all of those things. But [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3383.74s)]
*  we need to understand the full context of the relationship that's gone on between matter and [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3388.46s)]
*  China. Can you be a little bit more specific about like how this would impact [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3394.7799999999997s)]
*  an American five year let's say Facebook wins in the AI race, and an American five years from now [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3402.38s)]
*  is using that tool. How would it negatively impact them? Why should it matter to them? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3409.26s)]
*  Because I worry that this seems feels pretty abstract for a person that's just the end user [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3415.42s)]
*  of that tool. So I mean, I think it's it's more to, you know, to keep it at a high level. Do you [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3420.6200000000003s)]
*  want to be using, you know, do you want the Google of the AI world to be deep seek? Or [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3426.78s)]
*  do you think that it should? Or we should have the option of it not being a Chinese company? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3433.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's oversimplifying to some degree. But that that's when it's when it's when I say [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3439.7400000000002s)]
*  winner take all it's winner take all. What are you hoping comes out of it? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3445.34s)]
*  I'm hoping that as we enter this next technological era of AI, that we don't make the same mistakes [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3448.7s)]
*  that we did through the last era of social media. These are the same people that program the same way. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3458.22s)]
*  We can do so much better. And we really should. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3468.62s)]
*  How do you think the general perception of China has shifted back from when Mark wrote that original [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3471.9s)]
*  email in 2014 to now, not just in Facebook, but more generally, because I bet if we went and looked [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3479.1800000000003s)]
*  at other companies at the same time, they might have had that same sort of swashbuckling attitude [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3485.34s)]
*  that I feel like has shifted more generally. But tell me if you disagree with that. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3490.94s)]
*  I think I think I do. I think at that time, like Google had pulled out, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3495.66s)]
*  you know, that Google already been through some very bruising congressional hearings where, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3502.62s)]
*  you know, they'd said, you know, there were quotes about, you know, yes, financially, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3509.8199999999997s)]
*  I can't remember the exact quote, but you're a giant, you know, you're giant companies, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3515.2599999999998s)]
*  but but morally you're a pygmies like there, there'd already been a moment of accountability [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3518.8599999999997s)]
*  for technology in China. And, and, and, you know, an explanation of all the lessons of [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3524.62s)]
*  how that could go wrong and why. And, and that's why it was surprising, because it's like, well, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3531.82s)]
*  why, why wouldn't you look at why wouldn't you look at that? Why wouldn't you look at [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3538.54s)]
*  what your peer companies have decided and make similar decisions? So it really, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3542.2200000000003s)]
*  it was striking even then that it wasn't, it wasn't the same approach of other tech companies. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3549.34s)]
*  I think for most of us, the moment that the dangers, maybe a Facebook as a platform, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3555.5s)]
*  but also just a true misinformation and virality comes, you know, becomes a flashpoint is during [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3562.94s)]
*  the Hunta's genocide against the Muslim minority, they end up killing tens of thousands of people [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3570.7000000000003s)]
*  explain to us for those for whom that sort of like a hazy memory, the way that you understand [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3579.7400000000002s)]
*  Facebook's role that it played in that real world violence. Sure. So, so Myanmar is this really [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3586.46s)]
*  crazy example. And because it's one of the few countries in the world where they had, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3593.82s)]
*  they have this oppressive Hunter, right? And they, they controlled the internet. So there was no [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3599.5s)]
*  desktop. They never experienced desktop computers. There was nothing. And then there were mobiles. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3604.86s)]
*  And then the center of the mobile was Facebook. It was like the homepage for the country. Like [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3610.94s)]
*  everyone there was on it. And so it's the one time where you see what would happen if Facebook [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3616.54s)]
*  became completely ubiquitous in a country. And it wasn't good. Here's how, here's the way that you [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3622.78s)]
*  sort of diagnose the problem. Facebook becomes sort of overwhelmed in Myanmar with anti-Muslim hate. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3629.42s)]
*  Okay. And essentially what you say in the book is that the, there's no moderating function, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3636.7000000000003s)]
*  right? Facebook just either because it's overwhelmed or you'll tell me either because [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3643.42s)]
*  it's overwhelmed or doesn't want to censor it allows it to continue unabated. There's not enough [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3648.62s)]
*  checkers is what you talk about. And it was too, it was, it was a sort of a combination of there [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3654.86s)]
*  being not enough bandwidth, then being too slow to take this stuff down. And you watch as the sort [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3660.1400000000003s)]
*  of hate that's being perpetuated on this platform leaps into real life. Is that an accurate way to [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3667.1800000000003s)]
*  describe what happened? Yeah, that's exactly right. For the people listening and thinking, well, hold [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3672.94s)]
*  on, how could a private social media company be responsible for a real world genocide? Like [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3678.3s)]
*  make that case to someone. So to give you one example, there were riots happening and [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3684.54s)]
*  and like very bad riots and the government got in touch and said, look, we've got these riots, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3695.02s)]
*  you know, people are dying. Please, like this, this thing that's triggering it isn't true. It [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3701.5s)]
*  needs to come down and that will stop the riots. And in that environment where there is such a [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3707.9s)]
*  serious real world consequence, you think, okay, we should get that done. Because it seemed [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3715.42s)]
*  imperative to try and solve what was happening on the ground. And yet there just wasn't a way, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3723.5s)]
*  the company wasn't set up in a way to be able to even have the discussion around that, to be able [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3728.6200000000003s)]
*  to get the people, the right people together and make the right decision in the right amount of [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3734.78s)]
*  time. I think like one of the big sweeping stories that happens at Facebook after what happens in [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3741.42s)]
*  Myanmar and then of course, after the election of Donald Trump in this country is this intense [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3749.5s)]
*  focus on moderating speech, right? This intense focus on what should be allowed and what shouldn't [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3755.82s)]
*  be allowed. And if we kind of like pan out to the big picture, one of the things that happens in [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3762.46s)]
*  this country is that there is maybe you could argue an over extension of moderating speech to [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3767.9s)]
*  the point where real true stories that are written off at the time as being conspiracies. I'm thinking, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3775.58s)]
*  of course, of the Hunter Biden laptop, but maybe more importantly, stories about COVID and the lab [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3781.9s)]
*  leak. We had an essay from one of my editors about how that was taken down as fake news and [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3788.3s)]
*  conspiracy minded speech. And it kind of like, you know, led her down a path of just like not [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3793.34s)]
*  trusting Facebook and feeling really skeptical of this kind of moderation. So you could argue that [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3800.3s)]
*  it's a story maybe of the swing between total free for all to really heavy handed suppression, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3805.7400000000002s)]
*  including the sort of marriage of the Facebook moderating function and the Facebook fact checkers, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3813.9s)]
*  which have become kind of infamous and their connection with the state in this country. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3820.1400000000003s)]
*  Like, what is your big takeaway? I know it's a huge question, but like having seen it function [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3825.7400000000002s)]
*  in both ways, Sarah, like where do you stand? Where is the happy medium? Should Facebook be [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3833.1000000000004s)]
*  in the business of deciding what goes up and what goes on? Because I think one of the big stories [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3841.02s)]
*  of the past eight years is maybe they shouldn't be. Where do you stand? Because it's obviously one of [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3845.82s)]
*  the most like complicated, complex issues. On the one hand, we want Facebook to be or all of these [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3850.46s)]
*  platforms to be hewing to the spirit of the first amendment, the kind of place that has become, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3857.1s)]
*  I think, the actual town square in countries like ours. And yet there's the other side of it. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3862.86s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a really challenging issue. And I think the thing that is [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3871.1800000000003s)]
*  really central to me in this is that the company is claiming to be the company of freedom of [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3877.9s)]
*  expression now, as of the last two months or whatever. And that's certainly not what I saw [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3885.18s)]
*  in how it dealt with China. And I think if you look harder, every day you can find examples [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3895.4199999999996s)]
*  of where the company is saying it's the company of freedom of expression, but is not acting as a [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3905.3399999999997s)]
*  company that really believes in freedom of expression. So just to be clear, Sarah, on where [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3910.62s)]
*  you stand, like better to have a platform where there is some amount of misinformation and fake [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3916.22s)]
*  news than to have a platform where that and other true information is suppressed. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3923.66s)]
*  Look, if I'm choosing between the model that was offered and developed for the Chinese or the model [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3931.66s)]
*  that we have here, I definitely believe in the American model. I think we really need to [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3938.46s)]
*  think hard about a company that thinks it can offer both. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3948.14s)]
*  The epigraph of the book and of course the title is taken from F. Scott Fitzgerald's book, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3954.2200000000003s)]
*  The Great Gatsby. And the first page of the book contains those famous lines from the book [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3959.42s)]
*  talking about Tom and Daisy. Fitzgerald writes, they were careless people. They smashed up things [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3966.78s)]
*  and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3971.9s)]
*  was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made. Looking back, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3976.3s)]
*  and you haven't been there for a while, is the carelessness specific to Facebook and Silicon [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3981.34s)]
*  Valley or in your view, is it just sort of what happens to human beings when they get a certain [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3986.86s)]
*  set of money and power? So I think it's both. And I think Silicon Valley is sort of the extreme [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=3993.1s)]
*  example of it, but I definitely think you see it in both places. And I'd never experienced that. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4001.58s)]
*  I come from a small town in New Zealand. This is not the world that I'm from or know. And so for me, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4009.2599999999998s)]
*  what you just said brings really true. It's a different world. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4018.3799999999997s)]
*  Sarah, the book is coming out today. You're going to be news and already are making news [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4026.54s)]
*  all over the world for what's in this book. I went to Google you, obviously, before this conversation. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4032.14s)]
*  There's not much on the internet. You're a pretty private person. There's a lot of personal risk in [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4037.5s)]
*  publishing this book, a lot. Why take on that risk? It is hard. It really is. But [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4045.26s)]
*  I wouldn't do it if it wasn't so important, if we weren't at a moment now where it really mattered [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4057.5s)]
*  before we repeat these same mistakes in a much higher stakes context. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4066.5400000000004s)]
*  And I kept hoping that other people might do it. And yeah, it's hard to talk about because, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4075.42s)]
*  as you say, I'm just a quiet, normal, private person. But this really matters. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4085.6600000000003s)]
*  Sarah Wynn-Williams, thank you so much for joining me. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4092.86s)]
*  Thank you, Barry. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnePm30Vm0&t=4095.9s)]
