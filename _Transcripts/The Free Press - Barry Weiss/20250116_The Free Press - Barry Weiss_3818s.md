Very few people have worked closely with President-elect Donald Trump, gotten fired, and walked away with a pretty balanced view of him.

But former national security adviser to Trump, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster is an exception.

In his book At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House, he gives an honest account of working in Trump’s first administration: the good, the bad, and the unexpected.

Last week, McMaster sat down with Michael Moynihan at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia for an in-person Free Press Book Club event to discuss it all. They talk about his moments of tension with Trump, his understanding of Trump’s foreign policy, and how Trump’s rhetoric toward adversaries was actually good, despite being villainized by the press. And also, as McMaster puts it, Trump can be “so disruptive, he often interrupts his own agenda.”

They also get into the president-elect’s current cabinet picks—ones who McMaster sees as good, like Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, but how good picks do not ensure a harmonious administration. They discuss Trump’s options for handling Russia, Iran, and Hamas in his second term, and why McMaster is surprisingly and cautiously optimistic about Trump 2.0.

# H.R. McMaster’s Tell-all on Trump
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=0.0s)]

*  But former National Security Advisor, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, is an exception. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=10.84s)]
*  In his book, At War with Ourselves, My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House, he gives [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=16.54s)]
*  an honest account of working in Trump's first administration—the good, the bad, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=21.54s)]
*  and the very unexpected. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=26.72s)]
*  Last week, General McMaster sat down with my colleague Michael Moynihan at the National [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=28.42s)]
*  Constitution Center in Philadelphia for a live Free Press book club event to discuss [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=33.02s)]
*  it all. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=37.900000000000006s)]
*  They talk about his tensions with Trump, his understanding of Trump's worldview, particularly [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  his foreign policy, and how Trump's rhetoric towards adversaries was actually good, despite [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=43.22s)]
*  being villainized by the press. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=48.74s)]
*  And how, as General McMaster puts it, Trump can be so disruptive, he often interrupts [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  his own agenda. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=55.900000000000006s)]
*  They also talk about what to expect a few days from now when Trump takes office, Trump's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=57.3s)]
*  current cabinet picks, the ones who H.R. sees as good and the ones who sees as less good. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=62.54s)]
*  They talk about Trump's options for handling Russia, China, and Iran, and why H.R. is cautiously [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=66.9s)]
*  and surprisingly optimistic about Trump 2.0. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=72.66s)]
*  Just a quick note to say that the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=76.6s)]
*  for Defense of Democracies, which is chaired by McMaster, is the sponsor of this episode. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=80.88s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=85.82s)]
*  Thank you guys all for coming. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=86.9s)]
*  This is going to be slightly difficult for me because rarely do I have the occasion when [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=103.34s)]
*  I'm with someone interesting and important, it's happened before, and I think that I can't [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  contain it for 45 or 55 minutes, I need to do like three hours. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=115.9s)]
*  I do like a Rogan length, and that's kind of what's in my head. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=119.58000000000001s)]
*  So you're going to allow me to sort through some of the stuff that I want to talk to H.R. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=122.5s)]
*  about. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  The book, by the way, is fantastic, and I do a thing that I never do, I never read reviews [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  of books until I'm done reading them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=132.18s)]
*  On the train up here, I read the one from the New York Times, and I said they're going [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=133.94s)]
*  to absolutely slam him, they're going to hate him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=137.5s)]
*  And it was a guy from the Nation magazine, famously right-wing magazine, and they loved [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=139.46s)]
*  it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=145.5s)]
*  And the thing about it, which I agreed with me, it's brilliantly written, and that's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=146.0s)]
*  something that you don't often get from a member of the military or somebody who's been [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=149.34s)]
*  in the administration, there's usually some laborious prose. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=153.98s)]
*  That is not the case, read the book. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=157.3s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=159.14s)]
*  So H.R., I just wanted to start out, because of what is going on in D.C., we're about to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=160.38s)]
*  face another Trump administration in how many days now? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=166.5s)]
*  I don't even, 14 days, 15 days? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=169.18s)]
*  Talk to me a little bit about what it is like in that environment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=174.5s)]
*  You were there the first year in the first administration, and you read your book and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=177.54s)]
*  you're like, good lord, this is a nest of vipers. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=181.94s)]
*  Everyone's trying to backstab and push people out, et cetera. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=185.22s)]
*  How would you describe just that year in a sort of broad sense of going from the military [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=189.14s)]
*  into the White House and being in a position where there's a lot of newbies there and people [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=194.14s)]
*  don't really know what they're doing? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=198.4s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=200.0s)]
*  Well, hey, Michael, what a blast to be here with you and to be in my hometown of Philadelphia [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=201.0s)]
*  and everything. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=205.16s)]
*  I just want to say at the outset, go Eagles. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=206.16s)]
*  And I love the free press. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=217.52s)]
*  I mean, I think all of you are fans here too, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=218.8s)]
*  It's just so fantastic. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=221.88s)]
*  And what a privilege. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=225.24s)]
*  So thanks to everybody. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=226.24s)]
*  Thanks to everybody who came out tonight in the cold. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=227.24s)]
*  So it was at war with ourselves. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=229.76s)]
*  I mean, that's why that's the title of the book. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=232.84s)]
*  But that's not unprecedented. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  I took the title from my conversation with Admiral Poindexter, who had been a national [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  security advisor in the Reagan administration. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=242.56s)]
*  He was talking about not his time as national security advisor, although he did have a bumpy [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=244.56s)]
*  road there with the rank contract and everything else. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  But he was talking about the first year of the Reagan administration. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=252.6s)]
*  He said, yeah, we were at war with ourselves. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=254.84s)]
*  What I came to understand across that year is I think a lot of that at war with yourselves [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=258.67999999999995s)]
*  and that difficult environment you described has to do with the way people define their [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=263.73999999999995s)]
*  roles, how they see their roles as they come into an administration. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  And I think that there are people in any administration who want to help the elected president make [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=273.02s)]
*  the best decisions for the American people, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, that's what you would hope everybody wants to do. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=279.23999999999995s)]
*  And in my role, that had to do with making sure the president gets best advice and gets [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  multiple options to determine his own agenda and make those decisions. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=286.74s)]
*  But I mean, that's important because, you know, we talked about this beforehand, and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=290.86s)]
*  it's very clear in the book, too, is that you see your job as somebody who has to go [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=293.82s)]
*  in there and implement the president's agenda. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=298.7s)]
*  But it's clear in the book that you see people around you who have an agenda that they're [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  trying to foist upon the president. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=307.62s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think that's kind of the second group of people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=309.7s)]
*  They don't want to give the president options. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=312.46s)]
*  They want to manipulate decisions based on their own agenda, not the president's agenda. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=314.26s)]
*  And then in Donald Trump's administration, a group that was probably overrepresented [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  are people who define the president as an emergency who has to be contained or as a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=322.94s)]
*  danger to the country or the world. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=328.18s)]
*  And so the problem with that second and third group of people, hey, it's like nobody elected [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=329.94s)]
*  you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=334.06s)]
*  So not only are you not serving the president well. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=335.06s)]
*  But these are people he's chosen. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  They're people he's chosen. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  And they're saying we need to contain this person because he's dangerous. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's a couple of people in the book that say refer to Donald Trump as dangerous. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=341.82s)]
*  Right. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=345.02s)]
*  And and the tactics they employed to do that, it was all kind of it just made everything [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  harder. And really, the story of the book is it's really I think, you know, at least [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=352.06s)]
*  for the third three months I was there, we could we transcended it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=356.34s)]
*  We got things done anyway. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  But every every element of that friction just kind of wore you down, ground you down a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  little bit. And the tactics they employed undercut you and so forth. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=364.74s)]
*  But, you know, the first Trump administration, this is I think you're alluding to this like [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=369.42s)]
*  what's going to be different in the second one. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=373.06s)]
*  Nobody was as surprised as Donald Trump when he won the election 2016. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=375.9s)]
*  Right. And so there wasn't a whole lot of preparation in terms of who's going to come [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=380.21999999999997s)]
*  into a lot of these positions. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=384.26s)]
*  And he didn't have any kind of trust built up with a lot of the people that he didn't [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=386.1s)]
*  know the people. You know, now it's going to be, I think, somewhat different in that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=389.78s)]
*  he's had a lot more time to prepare deliberately for this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=394.02s)]
*  And and he's selected his people. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=397.09999999999997s)]
*  It was easy to kneecap me, you know, the people down the hall, because I didn't have a [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=399.7s)]
*  history with him. Now it's going to be harder to do that with Michael Waltz, who's really [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=404.42s)]
*  his clear pick. And he's known as a congressman, for example, or Marco Rubio, although they [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=408.74s)]
*  will come under attack, though, because there are still going to be these different camps [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=414.02s)]
*  in the administration based on those different motivations. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=418.7s)]
*  Right. But also based on I think some of the world views within the administration [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=421.41999999999996s)]
*  that will not be compatible with one another. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=426.78s)]
*  I mean, there's about 15 things I want to talk about there. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=429.3s)]
*  But let's stay in the present for just a second and look at those picks. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=431.06s)]
*  The reaction from a lot of people was these are serious picks. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=436.41999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you have the ones that are less serious. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  Right. And probably concerning to you people like Pete Hegseth. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  And it's not to say that his hasn't been an impressive individual in his service in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=445.38s)]
*  the military, but not a traditional pick, I would say. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=450.97999999999996s)]
*  So when you look at these, I mean, do you see, you know, is there a balance that Donald [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump tries to create with kind of chaos agents and then you, like serious people who [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=459.82s)]
*  are like, I'm sure that when you were walking in Philadelphia that day, you opened your [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=465.18s)]
*  last two books with walking in Philadelphia and getting that call. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  And I'm sure it was slightly unexpected when you first heard that you were in [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=471.58000000000004s)]
*  consideration. But what is the logic here? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=475.5s)]
*  I mean, did it surprise you that like, you know, Waltz, Rubio and some of these other [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=478.06s)]
*  serious picks? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=481.3s)]
*  Well, you know, President Trump obviously values loyalty like any president would. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=482.42s)]
*  But but also, you know, with President Trump, like any other any other president, right, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=487.14s)]
*  the most powerful person in the world, you could argue. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=491.98s)]
*  Right. So the people are going to try to ingratiate themselves to him and try to use [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=494.90000000000003s)]
*  him to advance their agenda. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, people, you know, they know how to push his buttons. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=500.86s)]
*  You know, I mentioned in the book, you know, the first meeting I went into into the Oval [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=504.22s)]
*  Office, I describe it as as an environment of competitive sycophancy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=508.5s)]
*  I mean, it was it was unbelievable. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=512.98s)]
*  You know, I mean, you know, I mean, your instincts are always so good, Mr. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=514.46s)]
*  President. You're so wise. I was like, oh, my gosh, are these are these people serious? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=518.58s)]
*  So so I think does he fall for that? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=522.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he does. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=525.82s)]
*  It's absolutely stunning. But he's not in that position. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=528.82s)]
*  But I get what people are doing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=531.18s)]
*  No, but I think a lot of people do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=532.82s)]
*  And really part of my motivation in writing this, you know, not that the president's [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=534.78s)]
*  going to be going to necessarily read or anything, but but and there's a lot positive [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=539.3s)]
*  about what he accomplished in here and so forth. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=542.7s)]
*  But, you know, I want it to be a bit of a warning to him, you know, to not that he [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=544.98s)]
*  he's got a guy who's in the real estate business. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=550.02s)]
*  Of course, he's always had people try to manipulate him or or so forth. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=552.22s)]
*  But he's particularly vulnerable to that kind of tactic. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=556.54s)]
*  And the other tactic I mentioned [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=558.74s)]
*  is that is that, you know, the president really enjoys [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=561.58s)]
*  positive attention, right, and praise and so forth. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=565.46s)]
*  Also from his loyal political base generally. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=568.5400000000001s)]
*  So oftentimes he would make a I think a really tough, great decision, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=571.74s)]
*  best decision he could make for the American people. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=576.82s)]
*  And then people get in his ear about it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=579.26s)]
*  You know, what do they say? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=581.1s)]
*  Hey, that's going to make you look weak to your base. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  That's going to alienate your base. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=585.26s)]
*  And so it's that kind of that kind of effort to influence him, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=587.06s)]
*  which precludes Donald Trump, I think, from getting to the politics of addition [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=590.78s)]
*  to bring more people into his movement, his tent and and and and results in, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=595.06s)]
*  you know, some of the maybe a couple of denominations, you know, and things [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=600.02s)]
*  that he does really to just double down on the affirmation from his base. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=603.26s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting you end that on the base. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=608.74s)]
*  It's in your book. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=612.26s)]
*  I think it is Bannon and maybe Reince Priebus. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=613.26s)]
*  We're talking about a line about Islamic terrorism. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=616.6600000000001s)]
*  And you suggested, let's not talk about a faith of Islamic. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=620.62s)]
*  Let's say it's Islamist. It's more specific. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=625.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And Bannon gets angry with you. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  Right. Was it Bannon who said, well, it was just a it was I think a way for him. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=632.14s)]
*  He said the base is going to like that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=635.22s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, that's kind of how to get him on your side is that those [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=637.4200000000001s)]
*  people that come to your rallies, they want to hear this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=642.78s)]
*  And that seems to work. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=645.66s)]
*  Was did you find that that was a tactic that a lot of people use? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=647.02s)]
*  And, you know, absolutely. Used it all the time, you know, and and, you know, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=650.9s)]
*  there's there are anecdotes about it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=654.42s)]
*  I mean, what I'd said to the president is, hey, you know, the the terrorists, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=655.74s)]
*  they want to define this as a war of religion. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=659.6999999999999s)]
*  But there are these are irreligious criminals who use a perverted [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  interpretation of Islam to advance their criminal and political agendas. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=666.54s)]
*  And he's like, I like that general. I like that general. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, and I said, all you have to do is call it Islamist, you know, and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=672.86s)]
*  and and then, of course, that that elicited the counterattack [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=677.46s)]
*  that really played out in Breitbart and all these, you know, pseudo media [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=681.66s)]
*  platforms that that that Bannon and others can influence, you know. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=685.02s)]
*  So but really, another example [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=689.58s)]
*  when he was going to pull out of the out of the Paris Accord, which, you know, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=693.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was fine with me because the Paris Accord doesn't accomplish anything [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=695.98s)]
*  anyway, right? If you really care about global warming. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=698.86s)]
*  I mean, what the hell good is the Paris Accord going to really do? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=701.34s)]
*  But but but he had a lie. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=703.86s)]
*  He had a line in the in the speech, you know, I was elected [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=705.54s)]
*  by the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=709.46s)]
*  And it was like just a gratuitous kick in the ass to Macron. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=712.14s)]
*  You know, it's called the Paris Accord, you know. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=714.74s)]
*  And he was trying to get Trump to stand. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=717.98s)]
*  I said, hey, you know, we could probably do without that line. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=719.58s)]
*  And then, of course, you know, that the response is, oh, no, the base will love it, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=722.1s)]
*  you know, for example, you know, or if he was concerned about [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=725.78s)]
*  transgender people coming into the military, for example, and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=730.98s)]
*  and the degree to which, you know, that's a preexisting condition, maybe, and so forth. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=734.34s)]
*  And I said, well, you should do a study of it and do it properly and make the decision. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=737.54s)]
*  And and and and and then the others who would said, no, your base [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=741.22s)]
*  wants you to just tweet something, just tweet something right now. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=746.1800000000001s)]
*  So so, you know, President Trump is very disruptive, you know, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=748.54s)]
*  and there's a lot of Washington that needs to be disrupted. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=752.74s)]
*  But part of the story is that he's so disruptive. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=756.38s)]
*  He often disrupts his own agenda as a result. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=758.9s)]
*  And so I think what you know, what helps him, what can help him [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=761.42s)]
*  are people around him who understand his agenda, who want to help him pursue his agenda, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=764.98s)]
*  but who help him be a lot more effective and again, kind of get to the politics of addition. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=768.54s)]
*  Right. One of the big themes in the book is that we're with ourselves [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=773.06s)]
*  like within the administration. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=775.5s)]
*  But hey, we're with ourselves across America, like in our polity. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=777.18s)]
*  Right. And we're everybody's at each other's throats. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=781.1s)]
*  And they, you know, the vitriolic nature of our discourse is not good for our psyche. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=783.46s)]
*  You know, and and it's also not good for the strength of our nation [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=787.5s)]
*  because it I think it portrays weakness to to to our adversaries and enemies abroad. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=790.4200000000001s)]
*  So so, you know, I guess the message would be, hey, let's get over it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=796.14s)]
*  You know, work together, have meaningful, respectful discussions [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=800.58s)]
*  about what we want to achieve to build a better future. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=803.86s)]
*  I want to talk about a word that is in your book, probably more than any other word, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=806.86s)]
*  including and it is Bannon. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=811.1s)]
*  Steve Bannon's name comes up a lot in this book. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=814.34s)]
*  No, not that much. It's a lot. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=816.38s)]
*  I did count. But it's a lot. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=818.54s)]
*  I mean, it's a big part of the story because at war with ourselves, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=820.66s)]
*  one of those those combatants is is Steve Bannon. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=824.26s)]
*  Yeah. And I know people have asked you a lot of things about this. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=827.86s)]
*  The one question I am thinking when I'm reading this stuff [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=830.98s)]
*  and he ends up leaving the administration before you. Right. Yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=835.18s)]
*  And then is now back in actually. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=838.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Works his way back into the president's good graces [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=842.1s)]
*  in time to get a presidential pardon before the end of Trump's first term. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=844.22s)]
*  Yeah. After he was profoundly disloyal to him and disparaged Trump [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=847.38s)]
*  to anybody who would listen. Yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=850.14s)]
*  And what is the position now is? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=852.02s)]
*  I don't know. It's a national security. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=854.22s)]
*  I don't know. I think he's like an outside attack dog. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=855.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But what what do you attribute that hostility to? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=857.6600000000001s)]
*  Because, you know, sometimes you have personnel like personal disagreements, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=864.34s)]
*  different styles. Is it an ideological thing? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=867.34s)]
*  Because Bannon's kind of shifting views on foreign policy, for instance, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=870.7s)]
*  is that kind of where it came from? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=874.3s)]
*  No, it really came from that really us being successful [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=875.46s)]
*  as part of the national security team on the National Security Council staff [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=880.22s)]
*  in presenting the president with best analysis and with multiple options. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=883.98s)]
*  Because Bannon didn't want multiple options. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=888.78s)]
*  He wanted his option. He wanted his foreign policy. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=891.18s)]
*  And so he saw me as a danger to his agenda. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=894.42s)]
*  Right. And so what they did is they came up with a number of narratives [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=897.86s)]
*  that then that then they advanced in social media and one of the biggest [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=902.1800000000001s)]
*  social media attacks against any individual in history up to that time [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=906.62s)]
*  in the summer of August 2017. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=910.1800000000001s)]
*  And it was right part against you, basically. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=913.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they spark it. Right. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=915.58s)]
*  But a company that didn't want to be named in the book [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=917.62s)]
*  did a digital forensics on it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=921.1400000000001s)]
*  A the the Atlantic Council [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=923.3000000000001s)]
*  digital digital forensics laboratory did at the time. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=925.86s)]
*  But since then, another company that does AI related analysis [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=928.86s)]
*  showed exactly how these messages spread. It's really fascinating. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=932.94s)]
*  And and they went to real people like real influencers [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=936.86s)]
*  and real kind of pseudo media platforms like like Breitbart and so forth. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=940.98s)]
*  Some cable news personalities, for example, some bloggers, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=945.22s)]
*  you know, in the blogosphere. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=949.46s)]
*  But then but then the message was spread and the heat. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=951.9s)]
*  It's like a heat sensor. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=955.18s)]
*  They show in this briefing spread wildly because of Russian [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=956.18s)]
*  bulls and trolls and and and and and bots, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=960.14s)]
*  because the Russians kind of allied themselves with. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=964.18s)]
*  I don't know what to call this group. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=967.2199999999999s)]
*  I don't know what you call them, Michael. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=968.38s)]
*  It's the alt right. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=969.54s)]
*  None of it's useful terms, right? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=971.3s)]
*  Because people have a broad range of views and they're entitled to their views. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=972.62s)]
*  I'm not disparaging them anyway. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=975.54s)]
*  But this group of people [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=977.02s)]
*  essentially were allied with the Russians, at least tacitly. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=979.26s)]
*  And and and that's how that's how the whole thing spread around three narratives. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=984.42s)]
*  One was, you know, I was a globalist general [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=987.9399999999999s)]
*  that wouldn't put like America first. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=991.58s)]
*  This the second was that that I was anti Israel, you know, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=993.42s)]
*  which was kind of ludicrous. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=997.26s)]
*  I mean, I write in the book that Prime Minister Netanyahu called me up [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=998.18s)]
*  and said, what the hell is going on? That's ridiculous. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1001.22s)]
*  You know, it's particularly weird because they've gone the other way [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1002.98s)]
*  on that issue recently. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1005.8199999999999s)]
*  People are not kind of fringe. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1007.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, right. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1009.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't know what they're excited about giving, you know, aid to Israel. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1010.62s)]
*  No, that's right. That's right. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1013.82s)]
*  They're internally inconsistent. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1014.98s)]
*  A lot of these views by this kind of group of people. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1017.1400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what to call them. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1019.82s)]
*  The redrenchers, the new isolationists. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1020.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, none of these labels are particularly, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1023.0200000000001s)]
*  you know, are comprehensive and there are a wide variety of views. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1025.42s)]
*  I mentioned associated with this within or within this group. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1028.5800000000002s)]
*  But yeah, they're inconsistent in their views. Yeah. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1032.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, people try to put their own views on Donald Trump. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1035.82s)]
*  I mean, this happens to a lot of people. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1040.42s)]
*  I just wrote a piece for the Free Press on Bob Dylan, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1042.1s)]
*  and you can find anyone saying he's right wing, he's left wing, he's a Marxist, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1043.98s)]
*  he's a Zionist, and it's like he's just a musician. Relax. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1046.94s)]
*  But the thing about it is like there's people do the same thing [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1050.34s)]
*  with Donald Trump all the time. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1053.18s)]
*  He's one of us. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1054.7s)]
*  He's like Ron Paul in foreign policy. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1055.78s)]
*  He's a neo isolationist. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1057.58s)]
*  What is the impression that you got from him [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1059.3s)]
*  ideologically when it came to foreign policy issues [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1062.2199999999998s)]
*  and the stuff that you were engaged in? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1065.02s)]
*  OK, so, you know, I think it's really important to understand [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1066.62s)]
*  where Donald Trump came from, from coming of age. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1069.4199999999998s)]
*  And I tried to write about this in the book, you know, 1970s. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1071.54s)]
*  Right. You know, lost war in Vietnam and the evacuation from Saigon. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1074.6599999999999s)]
*  You had the first president in history resigned during this period of time, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1079.06s)]
*  a period of stagflation, multiple energy crises in this period of time. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1082.06s)]
*  The you know, the the the really, you know, as we're eulogizing [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1086.06s)]
*  President Carter, really the Carter presidency, right? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1089.98s)]
*  And the Iran hostage. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1092.18s)]
*  And he felt he came out of that with a real sense of agreement [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1093.42s)]
*  that America has been aggrieved, that America has been taken advantage of. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1096.14s)]
*  And so he wants to, first of all, advance American interests. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1100.06s)]
*  I mean, America first. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1103.22s)]
*  It's really what he wants to do. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1104.02s)]
*  Not in the 1930s, Lindbergh sense, but like in his in a Reagan, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1105.5s)]
*  you know, Reagan, make America great again, make America great was Reagan. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1110.14s)]
*  It's it's I think consciously borrowed from that period of time. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1113.58s)]
*  And so he is well motivated in that connection. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1117.26s)]
*  There's nothing nefarious about that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1119.98s)]
*  But but he does, as a result, have this deep skepticism [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1122.26s)]
*  about sustained commitments abroad. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1126.06s)]
*  And he tends to see retrenchment or disengagement from those complex [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1128.42s)]
*  problem sets as an unmitigated good. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1132.02s)]
*  But at the same time, he understands peace through strength. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1134.3s)]
*  At the same time, he understands that it's a lot cheaper [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1137.86s)]
*  to prevent a war than to have to fight one. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1140.58s)]
*  He he wants others to share the burden. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1142.8999999999999s)]
*  But he's deeply skeptical of the alliances that allow burden sharing. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1146.42s)]
*  So he has a great deal of consistency, a lot of areas. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1150.38s)]
*  Right. I mean, border security, deregulation, trade issues, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1153.6200000000001s)]
*  encountering Chinese economic aggression, you know, for example, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1158.26s)]
*  invigorating our industrial base. Right. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1161.38s)]
*  He's he's dead consistent on that stuff. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1163.3400000000001s)]
*  But there are these other issue areas where he carries these opposing views with him. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1165.66s)]
*  And it's going to be the people around him who help him reconcile [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1170.38s)]
*  that kind of dissonance that he that he that he's carries. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1172.7s)]
*  I want to ask you about something he said today, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1175.78s)]
*  because I want to be interested to see what you would do in a situation like this. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1178.42s)]
*  That was that was that was a fun game. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1181.78s)]
*  I used to play with my wife Katie in the morning. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1183.78s)]
*  He's like, guess what? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1185.22s)]
*  Guess what the president tweeted last night as I was on the way out the door. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1186.54s)]
*  This is Donald Trump today at Mar-a-Lago said this [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1192.02s)]
*  about the hostages in Gaza. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1197.74s)]
*  It would not be good for Hamas and it would not be good, frankly, for anyone. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1200.22s)]
*  All hell will break out. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1204.5s)]
*  And this is if the hostages aren't returned by the time he becomes president. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1206.0200000000002s)]
*  I don't have to say anymore, but that's what it is. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1209.5800000000002s)]
*  And then he says that October 7th would have never happened if he were president. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1212.74s)]
*  That's the kind of stuff that you expect. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1218.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, you've heard this about Ukraine, too. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1219.46s)]
*  The invasion would have never happened. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1220.94s)]
*  That kind of rhetoric, the kind of bellicose rhetoric we're going to. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1222.46s)]
*  It's it'll be the worst thing that you've ever experienced. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1226.0200000000002s)]
*  If you don't do what I want. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1228.38s)]
*  How is that? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1229.98s)]
*  How does that fall in your ears when you're in the Oval Office of them? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1231.22s)]
*  I kind of like that. I like it. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1233.82s)]
*  You know, and I mean, I'm going to really do. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1235.54s)]
*  I totally like it by the way. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1237.46s)]
*  I'm sorry, but you're right. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1239.98s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, and so people would get out. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1241.7s)]
*  So he's unconventional. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1244.1000000000001s)]
*  Trump is really unconventional, obviously, you know, who'll say things that are arresting. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1245.26s)]
*  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I was like, wow, did he really say that? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1249.14s)]
*  But but oftentimes I recount some of these discussions in the book. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1252.98s)]
*  You know, some of the world leaders, it's really effective with them. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1256.74s)]
*  Like, he's not insulting with them. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1259.02s)]
*  Actually, when he's one on one with a world leader, he's a really good host. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1260.1000000000001s)]
*  He's kind of in the hospitality business. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1263.18s)]
*  You know, he's a very gracious host. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1265.26s)]
*  He's not mean to anybody in person, right? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1267.1000000000001s)]
*  He might tweet something mean about Justin Trudeau. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1270.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1272.66s)]
*  But he's not what he's going to be. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1273.78s)]
*  And he might say something like about 50 for a stay away. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1276.26s)]
*  I mean, gosh, oh, geez. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1278.38s)]
*  So but but I'm not saying everything he says is productive. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1279.5s)]
*  But in a lot of cases, because there's like really no filter, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1282.98s)]
*  there's no artifice with Donald Trump. Right. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1286.54s)]
*  What you see is what you get. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1288.42s)]
*  That's unusual for a politician. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1289.66s)]
*  And I think at times it can be effective for him. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1291.58s)]
*  And then I think also in these sorts of tweets, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1293.82s)]
*  I think that's what we should do is unleash hell on not only Hamas, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1296.7s)]
*  but their Iranian sponsors. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1301.3s)]
*  If the are hostages, the Israeli hostages and American hostages, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1302.98s)]
*  dammit, are released. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1307.18s)]
*  I for one, and you know, there hasn't been much discussion of this really. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1309.22s)]
*  I am disappointed that we have our military has not been actively engaged [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1313.7s)]
*  in getting our hostages back alongside of these really military. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1320.42s)]
*  Now, there are practical difficulties associated with that. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1323.94s)]
*  These roads are pretty common on their own. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1325.98s)]
*  You know, what really more can we do? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1328.1000000000001s)]
*  We could do more with the Houthis, for example. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1329.66s)]
*  You know, the Houthis who are an agent of the Iranians at the stage [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1332.9s)]
*  disrupting shipping the Bob Elm and Deb. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1336.9s)]
*  I think you could make relatively short work of the Houthis, you know. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1339.3s)]
*  And so there so there there is a way there are ways for him to make good on this, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1342.74s)]
*  you know, to make good on this kind of rhetoric. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1347.38s)]
*  He would also say other things. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1349.66s)]
*  I tell a story in the book, too, about, you know, Pakistan, right? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1350.78s)]
*  I mean, we had serial gullibility with Pakistan, right? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1353.8200000000002s)]
*  And we kept we believe for so many time and time again, you know, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1357.66s)]
*  if we just give them more aid, you know, they'll they'll behave differently [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1361.26s)]
*  and stop support for for terrorist organizations. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1364.46s)]
*  And, you know, and then finally, Trump just we were to stop [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1367.14s)]
*  were to cut everything off to the Pakistanis. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1369.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, he had told our government to do that, but they were [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1371.1000000000001s)]
*  every people were dragging their feet. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1373.3000000000002s)]
*  So a lot of the tweets, you know, some of them were, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1374.9s)]
*  I think a lot of them were effective, some were counterproductive. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1378.78s)]
*  Many of them were just amusing. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1382.42s)]
*  You know, like like like remember the one [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1384.26s)]
*  I would never call Kim Jong Un short and fat. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1386.66s)]
*  You remember that one? Yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1388.98s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I was I was I was in Hanoi at the time, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1390.54s)]
*  riding in the back of of of one of the armored cars in the convoy with them [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1394.98s)]
*  with Matt Pottinger, who's fantastic. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1400.7s)]
*  And we were just we were crying laughing about it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1403.42s)]
*  So I [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1406.54s)]
*  know I have a list of my favorite Donald Trump tweets that I randomly sent [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1408.94s)]
*  to friends that just amused me to no end there. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1413.1399999999999s)]
*  But how does that work in let's take North Korea, for instance? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1416.26s)]
*  You have on one level, you have these little rocket man tweets. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1420.54s)]
*  And then you have that was in the UN speech. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1425.66s)]
*  They tried to get to take that out of the speech. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1427.62s)]
*  There's stories. You have to take it out. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1429.02s)]
*  It was pretty funny. Yeah. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1430.3799999999999s)]
*  And then you have the kind of sycophancy in certain ways [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1431.62s)]
*  because it's kind of easy to flatter the guy. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1435.58s)]
*  And he likes being flattered. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1437.78s)]
*  I mean, there's a story in the book where this most amazing thing to me. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1439.34s)]
*  I couldn't believe that in the coverage of the book, I would pick this up. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1443.1799999999998s)]
*  If that there was it was a cover of the New York Post that he was signing. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1445.86s)]
*  No, it was it was it was a cover story. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1449.9399999999998s)]
*  It was a story, big headline story. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1451.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it was on page one. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1454.06s)]
*  I don't think it was it was not on page one. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1455.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he was. He clipped it and he was going to send it to Vladimir Putin. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1456.8999999999999s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, that's right. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1460.26s)]
*  And you intercepted it and stopped that. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1461.34s)]
*  He gave it to me to send to Vladimir Putin. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1462.98s)]
*  And like a mailman, Putin's mail. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1465.74s)]
*  I was in the it was late at night. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1468.26s)]
*  We're in that we're I was in there for on another matter. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1469.6599999999999s)]
*  And he gave it to me and I tell the story of the book and and and and that, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1472.8999999999999s)]
*  you know, that it was at the same time as we were discovering [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1477.1399999999999s)]
*  really the cause of the Skripal poisoning. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1480.8999999999999s)]
*  Remember the the use of the nerve agent in Salisbury, England, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1482.86s)]
*  in an attempt to murder Sergei Skripal and contaminate him and his daughter. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1487.26s)]
*  It put tens of thousands of people at risk. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1491.86s)]
*  Killed the women who killed woman later, who picked up a perfume bottle later. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1493.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So so I I I [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1497.42s)]
*  I brought it down to the staff secretary who runs all the paperwork [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1501.54s)]
*  to that would send us to the Russian embassy to go there. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1504.66s)]
*  And I said, hey, don't send this until I until I tell you to send it, you know, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1507.3400000000001s)]
*  and it's had it held them held it with them. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1510.38s)]
*  And then as everything came to light, I came back to the president. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1513.5800000000002s)]
*  I just told him, I said, hey, you know, remember that article [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1515.66s)]
*  you told me to send? I didn't send it, you know, and he was angry with me. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1517.54s)]
*  And I said, hey, listen, you know, he would. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1520.6200000000001s)]
*  How does that manifest? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1523.18s)]
*  He would be yelling at you. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1523.98s)]
*  Well, I mean, not yelling, not really yelling, but he was he was clearly angry. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1525.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, you should do what I tell you to do, general damage [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1529.6200000000001s)]
*  and something like that, you know. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1532.26s)]
*  So and I said, hey, you have to know I did this for you because, you know, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1533.22s)]
*  Putin would have used this thing against you, you know, and [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1537.1000000000001s)]
*  or to kind of escape responsibility for the Skripal poisoning [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1540.6200000000001s)]
*  and muddy the waters associated with it, embarrass you, you know. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1543.9s)]
*  So and then then, you know, then he moved on to something else, you know. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1547.42s)]
*  Yeah. So and didn't, you know, didn't think it angry about it again. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1550.6999999999998s)]
*  But I mean, it was these sorts of tensions, you know, kind of wear you down [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1554.86s)]
*  with them a little bit over time. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1557.8999999999999s)]
*  And and I think you had a choice. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1559.22s)]
*  Like what you could do is, you know, you could just try to take that kind of [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1561.58s)]
*  the ingratiate yourself path and, you know, the praise path and everything [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1564.86s)]
*  and and keep your job, you know. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1568.8999999999999s)]
*  But then that begs the question, what the hell good is it your job anyway? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1571.3s)]
*  Right. If you're not going to tell the president [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1574.46s)]
*  what you think, you know, he should hear from his national security advisor. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1576.58s)]
*  So I was at peace with being slowly ground down, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1579.78s)]
*  which is part of the part of the story in the book. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1582.26s)]
*  And and I consider it a privilege to do it every day, really. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1584.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't think I would have I mentioned the book. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1587.58s)]
*  You know, I would do it again if I could go back to walking down Walnut Street, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1590.1399999999999s)]
*  which is I open the book with your getting the phone call to come interview. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1594.1399999999999s)]
*  I would do it again, although, you know, President Trump and I [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1598.34s)]
*  are used up with each other. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1600.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm not never going to serve directly again. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1602.22s)]
*  But, you know, I hope he succeeds, as I'm sure we all do. Right. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1604.46s)]
*  You know, we need the president of the United States to succeed. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1607.46s)]
*  Just to go back to this question of what he believes, I mean, you know, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1610.5s)]
*  you leave this job and you talk, you talk about a very funny way that, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1613.9s)]
*  you know, John Bolton is like looking in the window like, hey, can I [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1618.5s)]
*  can I do this now? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1621.66s)]
*  And he was auditioning for the job previously. Right. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1622.6200000000001s)]
*  I know. So we there were four candidates for the job [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1625.5800000000002s)]
*  in Mar-a-Lago on President's Day weekend in 2017. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1629.0600000000002s)]
*  I President Bolton, President Biden, John Bolton. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1632.94s)]
*  Was interviewing with the president in the second interview just before me. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1637.5800000000002s)]
*  I didn't know that there had been a down selection [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1640.14s)]
*  after our first interview on Sunday. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1642.42s)]
*  I was held over for a second interview on Monday. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1644.42s)]
*  I didn't know who else was there until I run into John Bolton [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1647.18s)]
*  in the men's room on the way into the into that rather understated [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1649.8200000000002s)]
*  living room in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1653.5s)]
*  You know, I was just an ambassador general, you know, and then [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1655.8600000000001s)]
*  he was on his way out. I was on my way in. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1659.02s)]
*  And President Trump will tell a story. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1661.0600000000002s)]
*  But he walks across the living room, says, oh, no need for another interview. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1662.22s)]
*  You're hired and you start to talk about how to announce it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1665.14s)]
*  But the reason I bring Bolton up is that this has always mystified me. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1668.42s)]
*  And my and tell me if I'm completely off base here. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1672.42s)]
*  But I've always presumed that he hired him because he was on Fox News a lot. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1675.0600000000002s)]
*  And he was talking about foreign policy on Fox News. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1679.38s)]
*  And that's the foreign policy guy that I see on TV, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1681.7s)]
*  because he's a neoconservative in almost every way. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1684.38s)]
*  And people absolutely lost their minds in Bannon World and said, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1687.98s)]
*  make sure that this guy doesn't get close to anything and, you know, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1691.74s)]
*  it's never going to be a second time around with him. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1695.5s)]
*  But if he's the isolationist guy and he picks, you know, John Bolton, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1697.46s)]
*  as national security advisor, that never made sense to me. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1701.98s)]
*  Why do you think he did that? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1703.94s)]
*  Well, you know, it was kind of an extended audition, you know, and and and people [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1705.3400000000001s)]
*  around around Ambassador Bolton were some of the people kneecapping me from the, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1709.18s)]
*  you know, various various groups, a whole like a whole sort of system [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1713.74s)]
*  ecosystem that I didn't really even know existed around Washington. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1717.18s)]
*  But but, you know, he was you know, he was very strong on on Iran, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1721.0600000000002s)]
*  which the guy was to, but they would come after me [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1724.1s)]
*  when I was giving the president advice to not pull out of the Iran nuclear deal [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1727.4199999999998s)]
*  immediately. You know, he could do it whenever he wanted. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1732.1s)]
*  But I said, you have a lot of leverage right now. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1735.1399999999999s)]
*  Once you're out of the deal, you're going to lose that leverage. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1737.62s)]
*  So why not use staying in the deal temporarily to get the Europeans [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1740.78s)]
*  and others to impose more sanctions on the Iranians [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1745.1s)]
*  for their behavior outside of the nuclear deal and choke them off? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1748.54s)]
*  And then wouldn't it be great if Iran themselves get out of the nuclear deal [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1753.02s)]
*  because it's not doing what they want it to do. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1756.02s)]
*  So so we gave that a shot. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1757.6599999999999s)]
*  And then but of course, this led to a lot of criticism from, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1760.46s)]
*  you know, from Ambassador Bolton and mainly the people who were advocating [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1764.4199999999998s)]
*  for him to be the national security advisor, because, you know, what happens? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1767.62s)]
*  I realize this kind of later. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1771.74s)]
*  Is there all really these informal lobbying groups that kind of form [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1774.34s)]
*  around this particular person to get a person in the job? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1778.06s)]
*  And what they try to do is activate anybody who has the president's [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1781.86s)]
*  here to get in the president's here. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1784.98s)]
*  Oftentimes, these are the biggest donors. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1786.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, for example, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1789.1s)]
*  he'll don't have called the president. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1790.6599999999999s)]
*  You really need to get rid of that guy, McMaster, and you need Bolton. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1791.6999999999998s)]
*  Damn it. You know. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1794.22s)]
*  And so and so that that's what was happening behind the scenes. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1795.02s)]
*  And I describe him in the, you know, in the book is kind of like the dog, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1798.1399999999999s)]
*  the dog that caught the car, man, you know, because [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1802.3s)]
*  the president kept saying, well, what do you think about John? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1806.1799999999998s)]
*  Because he and I present, I had a lot of really, you know, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1807.6599999999999s)]
*  just sincere, good conversations about when I would leave. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1810.66s)]
*  You know, I said, you know, if this isn't working out, I'm fine. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1813.94s)]
*  We'll leave him whenever you want me to leave. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1816.54s)]
*  And and he would say, well, who do you think would be a good successor? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1817.9s)]
*  And I would give him some names and they always say, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1820.54s)]
*  what do you think about John? What do you think about John? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1822.14s)]
*  And I said, hey, if you if you trust him, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1824.26s)]
*  if you think he's going to give you the best advice and advance your agenda, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1826.94s)]
*  then he's the right person. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1831.26s)]
*  He even said to Katie the last day in the Oval Office, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1833.46s)]
*  we're leaving the leaving the White House on my last day. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1836.5800000000002s)]
*  And the president had my wife and I and my daughter and one of my daughters [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1839.7s)]
*  and sons-in-law and some nieces and nephews, you know, into the Oval Office. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1843.94s)]
*  And and he even asked Katie, he was like, hey, what do you think about John? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1848.66s)]
*  She said, what do you mean, like John Kelly? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1851.26s)]
*  And she's like, no, John Bolton. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1853.42s)]
*  That's OK. Well, you picked up, you know, I hope you like him. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1855.18s)]
*  I mean, there's a point where he asked the opinion of his bodyguard. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1859.82s)]
*  Who's had some role to which I was surprised by with some foreign policy [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1863.6200000000001s)]
*  issues asking his bodyguard. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1867.6200000000001s)]
*  No, yeah. You know, but that's what I think that's what he did when he was building, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1868.58s)]
*  you know, buildings in New York, like he talks to the construction people. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1872.46s)]
*  He talks to you see Mar-a-Lago, right? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1875.54s)]
*  He talks to the staff, hey, you know, about the event that they're [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1877.58s)]
*  going to host the Mar-a-Lago or whatever. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1880.82s)]
*  It's just it's kind of is it's just kind of his style. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1882.3799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, and John Bolton is extremely competent person. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1885.58s)]
*  He's extremely articulate. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1888.34s)]
*  He's very knowledgeable about all the, you know, the issues we were facing. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1889.5s)]
*  So, I mean, I mean, the guy was not without merit, you know, to pick as as [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1893.1s)]
*  my successor there. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1897.9s)]
*  Obviously, the attacks on Trump as a Russian agent [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1899.38s)]
*  were ridiculous and unfounded. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1904.42s)]
*  And, you know, he's obviously coming back into office with a [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1907.18s)]
*  justifiable chip on his shoulder about a number of the people that went after him. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1912.26s)]
*  Right. You said in your previous book, quite presciently, that [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1915.94s)]
*  we've allowed Russia to get away with a lot and it's probably going to be worse [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1920.54s)]
*  next time around. It's in the first chapter of the book. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1923.9s)]
*  And by the way, there's a quote from Saul Bellow at the beginning of that book, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1926.7s)]
*  which is like surprising, but only military book. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1929.78s)]
*  I've read it with a Saul Bellow quote. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1933.06s)]
*  But when you see what happened and Donald Trump says, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1934.66s)]
*  and, you know, the man with the Ukraine plan, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1938.22s)]
*  Mr. Kellogg, who is obviously an antagonist in this book, too, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1942.46s)]
*  he says, I'm going to solve all this. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1947.74s)]
*  Just give me a couple of days and I can take care of this. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1949.74s)]
*  Yeah. When he says something like that, I mean, you know, the bluster of it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1953.1000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump. Right. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1956.7s)]
*  Is there any part of you that says, yeah, he probably could, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1958.38s)]
*  or he might be able to get the ball rolling? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1961.22s)]
*  Yeah. Well, in this case, no. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1963.46s)]
*  And the reason is that I think what happens [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1965.3s)]
*  with President Trump and other presidents as well is they tend to mirror image, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1969.22s)]
*  whoever their interlocutor is, in this case, an adversary of Putin, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1973.42s)]
*  and think that he'll he'll kind of have a conversation with them in which [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1977.3s)]
*  he prioritizes the same things that I would prioritize. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1980.94s)]
*  But Putin is a man who's obsessed. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  He's a man who's obsessed with restoring Russia to national greatness [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1985.94s)]
*  and to do so really by reestablishing the Russian empire. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1989.42s)]
*  And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1993.38s)]
*  that's in reaction to what we could offer. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1997.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think also he's operating against history. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=1999.78s)]
*  I can't think of one example in history [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2002.7s)]
*  in which Assad was able to achieve a favorable outcome [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2006.66s)]
*  from a negotiated settlement that did not reflect the military realities [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2010.1000000000001s)]
*  on the ground. Right. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2013.9s)]
*  And so the idea that you can have it, get a big deal with him [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2015.34s)]
*  without first convincing Putin that he's losing. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2019.3s)]
*  I think I think President Trump will belatedly come to that conclusion. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2021.8999999999999s)]
*  He'll recognize that there cannot be an end to the war [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2026.3799999999999s)]
*  until Putin is convinced that he's losing because Putin won't stop. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2029.22s)]
*  Look at what he's doing right now. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2032.3s)]
*  He's already annexed Belarus. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2034.3s)]
*  He's continually the onslaught against Ukrainian people. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2036.1s)]
*  It's taking about 30,000 casualties a month, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2037.82s)]
*  which I think is unsustainable on the part of the Russians. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2040.58s)]
*  But he's you know, he's flipped an election in in in Romania. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2043.94s)]
*  He's meddling in other European elections. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2048.1s)]
*  He's cutting undersea cables, burning warehouses in the [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2049.82s)]
*  in Lithuania and and putting incendiary bombs on DHL aircraft. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2054.1s)]
*  I mean, Russia's waging a war against us right now. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2059.62s)]
*  And so I think also, though, Russia's very weak. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2062.98s)]
*  Putin is sitting on piles of cash that he can't convert. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2067.14s)]
*  He has a severe labor shortage. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2070.02s)]
*  They're on the verge of hyperinflation in the country. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2072.7799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, what if Donald Trump instead comes in, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2077.18s)]
*  instead of saying I'm going to solve it in a day, says, you know what? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2081.1s)]
*  This kind of feckless approach to supporting Ukrainians. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2083.98s)]
*  I think that was ridiculous. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2087.22s)]
*  I'm going to issue a long term low interest [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2089.1s)]
*  loan to loan to the Ukrainians right now to buy as many U.S. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2090.8599999999997s)]
*  weapons and munitions as they want. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2093.8199999999997s)]
*  There's literally no way that's going to happen, though, is it? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2095.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I don't know. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2097.54s)]
*  People that voted against Ukraine aid in April, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2098.8599999999997s)]
*  they were 10, 12 Republicans. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2101.38s)]
*  Yeah. Steve Bannon immediately went on his show and said they're traitors to the country. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2103.42s)]
*  But the man has influence and there's a lot of people that think that. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2107.42s)]
*  But Donald Trump is, you know, he's the deciding factor on that [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2110.02s)]
*  because you already have a lot of bipartisan support and you just had [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2114.26s)]
*  it was really that narrow, thin majority in the House that prevented it from happening. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2118.86s)]
*  So I what I think is possible. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2123.0600000000004s)]
*  And I actually don't even want to say this because I hope it happens. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2126.1400000000003s)]
*  And if I say it, it'll be less likely to happen. I'm not going to say it. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2128.42s)]
*  All right. So but I do think he will be able to he will come to the conclusion [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2130.66s)]
*  that Putin is is is intractable on this. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2135.42s)]
*  Yeah. Like and and and and and [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2138.42s)]
*  and I think he's going to that reality is going to hit him [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2142.18s)]
*  and then he's going to have a lot of options. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2145.42s)]
*  I mean, what if he said to MBS, you know, hey, what if we both produce some more oil? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2146.7s)]
*  What if we drive the price of oil down to 45, 50, even $50 a barrel? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2151.8199999999997s)]
*  Putin is screwed if that happens. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2156.7s)]
*  So he thinks Trump does think that way. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2159.1s)]
*  He has a lot of levers to put on Putin. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2161.8199999999997s)]
*  I think he should do it now. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2163.94s)]
*  He should do it up front. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2165.66s)]
*  And then if there is some sort of negotiation, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2167.5s)]
*  enter into that negotiation alongside the Ukrainians from a position of strength. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2171.1s)]
*  As a military man, I mean, it's funny because there's a lot of people [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2176.18s)]
*  that I've spoken to that I think would count as people in the isolationist, right? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2179.74s)]
*  Who laugh when I say, you know, the Russians are losing this war. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2183.94s)]
*  So how could you possibly say that? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2188.9s)]
*  But I mean, how many hundreds of thousands of people killed? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2190.14s)]
*  I mean, the the fall of the Soviet Union was precipitated in some way [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2193.7s)]
*  by the invasion of Afghanistan as a disaster. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2197.66s)]
*  Sixteen thousand people died. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2199.5s)]
*  I mean, this is orders of magnitude bigger in the United States. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2201.2599999999998s)]
*  It dislodged us for multiple generations. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2204.7799999999997s)]
*  The fact that in every one of these is a tragedy of 35, 3600 people dying in Iraq. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2208.06s)]
*  How I mean, how do you see that just as a military man that you're basically [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2213.34s)]
*  it's a World War One type meat grinder [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2217.46s)]
*  in the number of people dying in this very intractable conflict? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2220.38s)]
*  Like, is there a military solution to this? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2223.86s)]
*  I mean, do they have to come to the table and just swallow their pride [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2226.34s)]
*  and make some sort of agreement? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2230.1s)]
*  Well, you know, it's it's really the strain is on both sides, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2232.1s)]
*  the Russians and the Ukrainians. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2234.9s)]
*  Now, the Ukrainians also have a significant manpower shortage, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2236.26s)]
*  have a hard time generating the manpower to sustain their their defensive capabilities. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2239.14s)]
*  But but Russia's ambitions are much larger than their military capabilities, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2243.38s)]
*  even as they're employing North Korean troops, you know, 12000 North Korean troops, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2247.98s)]
*  not a sign of strength that they're doing that. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2251.86s)]
*  That force is already decimated, by the way, that North Korean force. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2254.2200000000003s)]
*  So so what has to change? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2258.2200000000003s)]
*  The dynamic has to change somehow. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2260.26s)]
*  There's no such thing as a permanent stalemate in war, not one that I can think of. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2262.2200000000003s)]
*  Remember, the Western Front World War One was stalemated. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2266.34s)]
*  It was stalemated until until it wasn't anymore. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2269.1400000000003s)]
*  By the Ludendorff offensives, which actually it's it's [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2273.5s)]
*  the the Russians were employing kind of the the, you know, the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2277.42s)]
*  the German World War One infiltration tactics is what they're using right now [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2280.94s)]
*  to make some of these gains on the on the on the Western, you know, front in Ukraine. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2285.58s)]
*  And then and then, you know, the war ultimately ends as a war maneuver [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2292.42s)]
*  with the entry of the United States, you know, but but there are a series of swings [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2295.7400000000002s)]
*  back and forth in 1917, General Nivelle, you know, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2299.54s)]
*  the leads in offensive, he says, I have the solution. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2303.58s)]
*  Whenever a general says that, you know, look for the exits. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2306.7000000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2309.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, a general has the solution. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2310.5s)]
*  So so he impales the French Army on German defenses, breaks the French Army, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2311.7000000000003s)]
*  the French Army mutinies. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2316.7400000000002s)]
*  It looks like it's going to collapse. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2317.7400000000002s)]
*  Then you have the Ludendorff offensives, which follow, which gain a lot of ground, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2319.46s)]
*  but then peter out and then you get the allies gaining strength with U.S. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2322.42s)]
*  entry and the war ends as a war maneuver. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2326.7000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, right now, there's not a lot of movement on the front. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2328.6600000000003s)]
*  But that could change. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2333.5s)]
*  Every military has a breaking point, right? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2335.06s)]
*  Every military, every person has a breaking point. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2336.86s)]
*  Battles, combat is aimed at the disintegration of human groups. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2339.94s)]
*  And when I look at the the, you know, the the losses [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2345.98s)]
*  that the Russians are taking, I just don't think it's I don't think it's sustainable. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2350.42s)]
*  Yeah. And that's one more question we're to get to you guys. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2353.86s)]
*  One final broad based question. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2358.1400000000003s)]
*  Knowing what you know from the inside, knowing so many of the people [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2360.5s)]
*  that are involved in the first term yourself, being involved in the first term [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2363.9s)]
*  for over a year. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2366.86s)]
*  What are your expectations now knowing the man of Donald Trump? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2370.3s)]
*  Is it is he a man that's capable of learning lessons and saying, all right, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2373.34s)]
*  well, I've done this before the first year, as you point out, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2376.98s)]
*  your book was absolute chaos inside that White House. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2380.82s)]
*  Do you expect there to be a more kind of stable White House now [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2383.58s)]
*  in a more kind of sort of a smoothly run operation? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2388.2599999999998s)]
*  And the reason I ask this is because a lot of people have said, well, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2390.94s)]
*  the worry about Donald Trump winning is that all the guardrails are off. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2394.14s)]
*  And now you have like DListers and, you know, like sub sub Gorka types [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2398.66s)]
*  to come in and be and be crazy. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2403.3s)]
*  I mean, what do you expect from this White House? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2405.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, there are a lot of talented people come to this administration. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2407.5s)]
*  I mean, I mean, there are some people I wouldn't pick. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2410.02s)]
*  And you mentioned a couple of them. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2412.46s)]
*  But the Secretary of State is fantastic. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2414.34s)]
*  I worked with Senator Rubio on a big shift in the Cuba policy. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2416.18s)]
*  He's extremely professional, collaborative. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2420.62s)]
*  He worked extremely well across the aisle in Congress to help get through elements [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2422.7s)]
*  of the president's foreign policy agenda. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2426.5s)]
*  He was one of the first people to really raise the alarm bells on China [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2428.7s)]
*  and China's weaponization of its mercantilist economic model against us. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2432.22s)]
*  I think he's a fantastic pick. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2436.8199999999997s)]
*  Mike Waltz, the congressman, is a true professional. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2438.8199999999997s)]
*  He's an empathetic person. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2443.06s)]
*  He's a team builder. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2444.42s)]
*  He is a he's a military veteran who's led [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2446.5s)]
*  with with distinction and special forces. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2450.02s)]
*  And he understands defense and national security issues extremely well. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2453.34s)]
*  His subcommittee, one of the subcommittees that he led also in the [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2457.54s)]
*  in the House was a subcommittee on China's influence on the Western Hemisphere. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2460.1s)]
*  So he's gone deep into a lot of these critical issues. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2463.3s)]
*  He's going to be a fantastic. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2466.38s)]
*  He is a fantastic. His deputy, Alex Wong, is extremely effective as well. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2468.02s)]
*  I mean, how it's hard to take exception with the Secretary of Commerce or Treasury [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2472.46s)]
*  or the interior, Doug Burgum. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2477.42s)]
*  So this is I mean, this is really kind of an A team in a lot of ways. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2480.54s)]
*  But what does concern me to get your question is, will it be harmonious? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2485.1s)]
*  Probably not harmonious, right? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2489.22s)]
*  And the Trump administration. But what concerns me are people. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2490.86s)]
*  No one concerns you. But who concerns you? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2494.42s)]
*  Well, you know, it's too nice to answer. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2496.42s)]
*  There are people who are coming into the administration [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2499.1s)]
*  who are in that kind of retrenchment. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2503.42s)]
*  All of the ills of the world were due to neoconservatives, right? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2506.26s)]
*  Who got us involved in all these endless wars. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2510.46s)]
*  And that's really what's put our constraint on our country. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2513.14s)]
*  And, you know, and we have to. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2516.14s)]
*  So a lot of people who got labeled, you know, as kind of the neoconservatives, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2518.1s)]
*  they got they're already decapped and out of the picture. Right. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2522.86s)]
*  And so and so I said anti neocon faction, for lack of a better phrase. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2525.62s)]
*  Are they more powerful now than they were in 2017 and 19? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2530.7799999999997s)]
*  I think so. Yeah, I think so. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2534.3799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, it's hard to say like where they're more powerful. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2536.54s)]
*  But I think some of the appointments reflect it. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2540.5s)]
*  But I think overall, if you have the senior people in the cabinet [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2543.4199999999996s)]
*  and national security advisor, the the the head of the NEC, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2548.3799999999997s)]
*  National Economic Council, who are determined to bring the president [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2552.46s)]
*  options to give him best analysis, you can work this out. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2556.54s)]
*  Differences of view are OK. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2560.1s)]
*  I think that's good. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2562.2200000000003s)]
*  You want to have a debate in front of the president. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2563.62s)]
*  I think what really is a disservice to a president [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2566.9s)]
*  is when you have a group of people who form kind of a cabal to end [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2570.3s)]
*  run things like the neoconservative and to manipulate like the neoconservatives [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2574.42s)]
*  who have been accused of a cabal. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2579.1800000000003s)]
*  Let's take some questions. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2581.02s)]
*  I don't want to go too long here. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2582.06s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure there's. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2583.02s)]
*  On Israel, which we haven't spoken that much about. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2587.78s)]
*  Couple questions. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2592.3s)]
*  First is what should Israel do once they're done with the Houthis? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2593.3s)]
*  With Iran and second. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2599.98s)]
*  How would you structure a [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2603.9s)]
*  an a quote unquote occupying force or supervisory force [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2608.1s)]
*  in Gaza once the hostages are returned? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2615.22s)]
*  OK, all right. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2620.34s)]
*  So hey, Israel is fighting. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2621.22s)]
*  You mentioned a few fronts. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2623.8199999999997s)]
*  Israel's really fighting a seven front war right now, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2624.7799999999997s)]
*  obviously against Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2627.66s)]
*  They're still fighting and conducting strikes in Syria [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2630.42s)]
*  where Iran had been assembling a proxy army to invade Israel, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2634.1s)]
*  at least to bolster Hezbollah, and then invade Israel in the West Bank, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2639.5s)]
*  where they have foiled the efforts to to bring in a lot more munitions [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2643.62s)]
*  and capabilities into the West Bank to turn the West Bank into an even bigger Gaza. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2647.3799999999997s)]
*  In Gaza, you mentioned the Houthis in Yemen, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2651.8599999999997s)]
*  but also directly from Iran. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2655.9399999999996s)]
*  You know, that's I think that's seven fronts, right? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2657.54s)]
*  So so I think Israel had faced until they took really decisive action. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2660.3399999999997s)]
*  They had faced the biggest threat to Israel's existence since 1948. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2668.38s)]
*  And the council we were giving them was exactly the opposite [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2672.18s)]
*  of what they needed to do, and ultimately they did do to deescalate. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2675.18s)]
*  Right. This mantra of deescalation is folly, essentially, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2679.5s)]
*  because what that what that sounds like to the theocratic dictator in Tehran [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2684.02s)]
*  is the license to escalate on his own terms with impunity. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2689.1400000000003s)]
*  So you have to destroy Hamas, right? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2692.58s)]
*  Hamas in its charter says that they want to destroy Israel and kill all the Jews. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2695.3s)]
*  The people who say there should be a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2700.42s)]
*  The next sentence, they usually say, and we need a two state solution. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2703.5s)]
*  Well, hey, Hamas is not signed up for a two state solution, you know. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2706.7000000000003s)]
*  So it's going to take the destruction of that organization, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2710.7400000000002s)]
*  but the destruction will not only be military. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2713.1800000000003s)]
*  There has to be the emergence of a political alternative [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2715.82s)]
*  to Hamas, and there has to be space for that to happen, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2718.7400000000002s)]
*  because if there isn't a peace enforcement force there, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2722.1s)]
*  which I think has to be multinational, it maybe should include [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2726.26s)]
*  the Egyptians as a backbone. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2729.1s)]
*  Maybe they won't do it. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2730.7400000000002s)]
*  This I'm thinking theoretically kind of. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2731.82s)]
*  Then who's going to be the mayor of Gaza? Right. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2734.5s)]
*  So you say, I'll be the mayor of Gaza. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2736.62s)]
*  Guess what happens? You get a bullet in the head, you know, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2738.02s)]
*  because because Hamas still has the guns. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2739.98s)]
*  You have to disarm them and put a security force in there [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2742.1s)]
*  that will allow a political alternative to Hamas to emerge. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2744.7400000000002s)]
*  Until that time, what Israel's doing, what they've already done it, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2747.46s)]
*  essentially, is they've reduced the buildings on the outside of Gaza [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2750.22s)]
*  to create space, physical space, to ensure that another attack like that [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2753.86s)]
*  can happen. And they're creating high speed routes [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2757.42s)]
*  to run north, south and east, west that allow their forces access [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2759.7s)]
*  to conduct raids against Hamas cells as they get reestablished. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2762.94s)]
*  The sad part about that is there can be no better life, really, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2767.9s)]
*  for Palestinians until there's an alternative order [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2770.2999999999997s)]
*  that allows, again, you know, a political alternative to come in [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2773.2599999999998s)]
*  that does not, like Hamas did, divert all the assistance [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2776.3s)]
*  into Hamas's terrorist infrastructure and to perpetuate the destitution [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2780.1000000000004s)]
*  of the Palestinian population in Gaza. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2784.02s)]
*  So that's Gaza. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2787.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, I think you're going to see a continued occupation of, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2788.46s)]
*  you know, of a portion of Syria, you know, beyond the Golan [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2791.46s)]
*  for a while until because I think that this is just a new stage, sadly, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2794.6600000000003s)]
*  in the Syrian war. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2799.1800000000003s)]
*  And and I think what's really important is for the United States [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2800.94s)]
*  to work with others and with Israel to really marginalize Hezbollah [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2804.6600000000003s)]
*  in Lebanon now to try to create conditions that are reminiscent [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2808.34s)]
*  a bit of the Cedar Revolution in 2006 after Hariri's assassination. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2812.1800000000003s)]
*  Then what you want to do is we got to choke off [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2817.02s)]
*  the cash flow to the Iranian regime. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2820.46s)]
*  Iran wants to reconstitute all these forces that Israel has brilliantly [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2823.1800000000003s)]
*  you know, defeated, destroyed, you know, disrupted [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2827.98s)]
*  with, you know, with the with the beeper explosions and the walkie [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2831.46s)]
*  talkies and the strikes against, you know, against Hezbollah. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2834.2200000000003s)]
*  And they need cash to do that. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2838.34s)]
*  So we should be cutting the cash off so that so they can't do that. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2839.78s)]
*  And then, of course, ultimately, what Israel is going to have to deal with [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2843.02s)]
*  is the nuclear threat from Iran. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2846.38s)]
*  And I think there's a 98 percent chance in the next couple of years [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2848.26s)]
*  that that Israel will conduct a direct strike against Iran's nuclear [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2852.86s)]
*  and missile capabilities. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2857.2200000000003s)]
*  Will we do that with them? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2859.3s)]
*  It's unclear. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2860.5s)]
*  As you know, there could be maybe an evolution in the nature [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2862.54s)]
*  of the Iranian government. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2865.3s)]
*  You know, could that happen? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2866.46s)]
*  Iran is in a very weak spot right now. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2868.3s)]
*  They can't refine their own oil. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2870.98s)]
*  There are fuel shortages. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2872.86s)]
*  They're cash poor and can't, you know, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2874.98s)]
*  continue the subsidies that they've had for so long on fuel, for example. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2878.7s)]
*  China's buying 97 percent of their oil. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2882.5s)]
*  You know, what if we were to place sanctions on on secondary sanctions [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2885.42s)]
*  on Chinese banks that are facilitating financial transfers to the Iranians? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2889.34s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot we could do to amp up the pressure on the Iranian regime [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2892.7400000000002s)]
*  while giving full credit for the terrible conditions in Iran [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2896.6600000000003s)]
*  to the theocratic dictatorship that's responsible for it. Right. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2900.78s)]
*  It's really the corruption of that regime that's denying the Iranian people [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2904.1000000000004s)]
*  the future they could have. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2907.46s)]
*  Thanks for the question, because they're a great response. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2909.6600000000003s)]
*  Just quickly. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2911.86s)]
*  I mean, do you suspect this moment in Israel's history [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2913.58s)]
*  will be looked back on as somebody who's written books about military history [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2916.3s)]
*  as one of the most impressive moments in the state of Israel's history? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2921.54s)]
*  I mean, thinking about the people attacks, you know, eliminating the leadership [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2925.38s)]
*  of taking out, I'm sorry, of Hezbollah and Hamas taking out air [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2928.7000000000003s)]
*  defenses in Iran, no major response from the Iranians, which we expected. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2933.2200000000003s)]
*  This is a pretty impressive record in the past year and a half. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2937.94s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2943.1000000000004s)]
*  And I think [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2944.9s)]
*  what these really didn't do is they didn't forget the don't part [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2946.7400000000002s)]
*  of don't take counsel of your fears. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2949.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, we we talk ourselves out of out of a lot of actions [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2952.02s)]
*  because we we we portray our adversaries as strong. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2956.02s)]
*  Iran is profoundly weak. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2960.58s)]
*  You know, their proxies have been profoundly weak for an extended period of time. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2962.46s)]
*  Now, what Israel did, you know, was was brilliant. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2966.94s)]
*  And and but what they mainly did is they made the decision [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2971.34s)]
*  that they were not going to only play defense. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2974.98s)]
*  When does that work in sports? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2977.82s)]
*  And that works in, you know, can you imagine if you only play defense? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2979.46s)]
*  You wouldn't ever win a game. Right. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2981.94s)]
*  So it doesn't work in war either, by the way. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2983.1800000000003s)]
*  So so they decide they had to go on the offense. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2985.26s)]
*  I mean, they flew a hundred and forty aircraft into into Iranian airspace [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2988.46s)]
*  and ran laps around Tehran. Right. I mean, so so I think I think [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2992.78s)]
*  what Israel did was was courageous. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=2999.42s)]
*  It was necessary, I think, because they were facing an existential threat. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3001.46s)]
*  I believe Ayatollah Khamenei on October 7th [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3005.02s)]
*  had decided to activate the ring of fire. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3007.46s)]
*  I think he wanted to cross the destroy Israel task off his to do list. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3009.9s)]
*  Yeah. One thing you haven't touched upon very much is is China. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3015.42s)]
*  And Xi Jinping has said to his military, be ready for 2027. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3019.34s)]
*  I believe him. Yeah. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3024.94s)]
*  What would the Trump administration do under those scenarios? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3026.3s)]
*  OK, so I believe him, too. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3030.86s)]
*  And I think that, again, we kind of mirror image, Xi Jinping, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3032.78s)]
*  and we undervalue the degree to which emotion and ideology drives [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3035.7400000000002s)]
*  and constrains the behavior of these adversaries. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3039.1000000000004s)]
*  He's driven by the fear of losing the party's exclusive grip on power. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3041.94s)]
*  And he's driven by an aspiration tied to that fear, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3045.1800000000003s)]
*  which is to restore China to to national greatness or national rejuvenation. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3047.94s)]
*  The vision subsuming Taiwan, he's made that a centerpiece of his view. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3051.86s)]
*  He said in many speeches, this is no longer a long term problem. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3056.1000000000004s)]
*  In a recent speech, again, he alluded to his determination [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3059.66s)]
*  to retake Taiwan if they don't come to their senses, right, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3063.3s)]
*  and give him what he wants, which is annexation by invitation. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3066.26s)]
*  Also, the same kind of aggression you're seeing in the South China Sea [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3070.1s)]
*  really amping up, right. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3073.14s)]
*  And it was really it was during Jake Sullivan, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3074.66s)]
*  national security adviser's visit to China when, you know, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3077.38s)]
*  when China decided to commit like seven acts of war [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3080.62s)]
*  against the US treaty ally in the Philippines. Right. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3083.58s)]
*  So so they're they're not being, you know, reticent about it. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3085.7400000000002s)]
*  And by the way, it's not just what they say, it's what they're doing. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3089.42s)]
*  It's the massive military buildup and a range of capabilities, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3092.1800000000003s)]
*  including what would be needed for a cross trade invasion, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3095.42s)]
*  but also what we need to keep us at bay. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3098.5s)]
*  And also the strategic forces where they have increased [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3100.9s)]
*  the size of their nuclear force, they're on the path to by 400 percent. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3103.7400000000002s)]
*  They're conducting massive surveillance against us. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3107.9s)]
*  And by the way, look at the cyber attacks they've been conducting against us, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3109.7000000000003s)]
*  how they got into our telecoms. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3113.1800000000003s)]
*  I believe that China is preparing for a first strike [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3114.98s)]
*  nuclear capability against us. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3117.9s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3119.98s)]
*  And I think I think that we have to really see this in a very clear [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3121.34s)]
*  eye view. I don't know why we have not imposed [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3125.46s)]
*  massive costs on China for these recent cyber intrusions into our systems. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3128.9s)]
*  What the heck are we waiting for? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3134.02s)]
*  So I think what you'll get with a drum is ration what we need it. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3135.62s)]
*  And we need is a focus on hard power. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3138.82s)]
*  Less of the Ukraine war is nobody's afraid of the Secretary of State [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3142.26s)]
*  going to visit people. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3146.34s)]
*  You know what they're afraid of is hard power, you know. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3147.78s)]
*  And and we are behind in investments in defense. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3150.6600000000003s)]
*  We have a huge bow wave of deferred modernization. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3153.58s)]
*  And the capacity of our armed forces is inadequate. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3155.94s)]
*  The second thing aspects are really having to do with our industrial base [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3159.3s)]
*  and our defense industrial base and supply chains to become overreliant [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3164.46s)]
*  on single points of failure controlled by China, which gives China coercive power [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3167.98s)]
*  over our economy and our industrial base. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3172.2200000000003s)]
*  I think you're going to see broad action immediately by the Trump administration [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3174.9s)]
*  on those areas. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3178.7000000000003s)]
*  Now, there is a bit of a dissonance again in the administration with the budget hawks. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3180.06s)]
*  Right. And retrenchers and the peace through strength crowd. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3183.58s)]
*  But I think peace through strength is going to win out on that. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3187.58s)]
*  But but there is, I think, a unity of perspective on the range of tools [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3190.54s)]
*  of economic statecraft that have to be employed tariffs among them, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3195.14s)]
*  export controls, inbound and outbound investment screening. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3199.14s)]
*  If anybody has money in China, I mean, try to get it out. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3202.66s)]
*  You probably can't, you know, which should be a sign anyway. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3205.22s)]
*  But I think there's going to be a rending in the economic and financial relationship [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3208.22s)]
*  with China that is analogous to what happened with Russia, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3212.2999999999997s)]
*  except it's going to have a massive effect on the global economy. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3215.8599999999997s)]
*  It's going to be hard. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3218.3399999999997s)]
*  But but if you know, if you don't plan for it now, try to prepare for it now. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3219.54s)]
*  You're going to be caught like, you know, like BP and others were in Russia [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3225.02s)]
*  with their capital stranded there. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3230.54s)]
*  Sean Core. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3234.2200000000003s)]
*  Now, you just mentioned the US capabilities. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3237.98s)]
*  One of the things that I when I hear a biography of you given, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3241.46s)]
*  one of the things that's always skipped over was your last posting [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3244.5s)]
*  before you became national security adviser, and that is you were head [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3247.34s)]
*  of the Army's Future Command. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3250.6600000000003s)]
*  So what I was thinking is what you were studying back there in 2016 and 2017 [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3252.42s)]
*  probably is playing out in Ukraine right now. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3257.26s)]
*  Have you seen things that you didn't expect when you were in the job? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3261.0200000000004s)]
*  And did you see things that you did expect? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3264.34s)]
*  And can you just comment like what the future of the military looks like [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3266.34s)]
*  based on what we're seeing now? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3268.9s)]
*  Well, hey, thanks, Sean. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3270.46s)]
*  So the job I had was director of the clunkily named Army Capabilities [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3272.3s)]
*  Integration Center, and your job was to to design the future army [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3276.34s)]
*  to help prioritize research and development and to recommend changes [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3280.3s)]
*  in technological capabilities, weapon systems, organization, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3283.9s)]
*  doctrine, terrain, leader, development, so forth. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3287.54s)]
*  And so I think we saw the how warfare was evolving pretty clearly back then. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3289.5s)]
*  We had commissioned a study on Russian new generation warfare [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3295.86s)]
*  and what Russia had had done in using the combination of conventional [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3299.1s)]
*  unconventional forces in the first assault on Ukraine in 2014. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3303.7000000000003s)]
*  And we were studying very closely what the Chinese had done to take apart [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3307.46s)]
*  our exquisite capabilities that we had banked on. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3311.3s)]
*  Remember, at the time, back when I had this job, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3313.98s)]
*  there was a lot of this lexicon about defense was the revolution [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3317.46s)]
*  in military affairs, right, or or maybe even like the third offset [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3320.7s)]
*  that the model was we could invest in fewer and fewer more exquisite systems [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3324.62s)]
*  with more advanced capabilities. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3330.22s)]
*  And that's what would guarantee our security. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3331.82s)]
*  When, in fact, our we had seen our potential enemies [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3333.98s)]
*  developing countermeasures, tiered and layered air defense, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3337.62s)]
*  counter satellite capabilities, offensive cyber capabilities, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3339.9s)]
*  swarm drone, long range precision strike, like the Chinese long range missiles [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3342.8599999999997s)]
*  and so forth, electromagnetic warfare. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3346.8199999999997s)]
*  So we are seeing a lot of that play out. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3350.22s)]
*  And and what we were trying to race to do, which, you know, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3352.2999999999997s)]
*  the Pentagon doesn't race to do anything, sadly, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3355.38s)]
*  it was to it was to incorporate back into our force a lot of capabilities [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3358.98s)]
*  we let go because we thought we were always going to be dominant [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3361.98s)]
*  as a dominant force, air defense against drones, for example. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3364.8599999999997s)]
*  And of course, everybody's, you know, when they talk about Ukraine, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3369.2200000000003s)]
*  they're like, wow, the drone is the age of the drone. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3371.86s)]
*  Well, it's the age of something until you develop the countermeasure [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3374.38s)]
*  and field it right. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3377.2200000000003s)]
*  It was the age of the machine gun until the tank. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3378.46s)]
*  It was the age of the tank until the tank, the anti tank missile. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3380.58s)]
*  It was the age of the submarine to the sonar, the age of the bomber [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3383.3s)]
*  until the radar. Right. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3385.7400000000002s)]
*  So what you're seeing in Ukraine is playing out of this [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3386.86s)]
*  continuous interaction of opposites. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3390.42s)]
*  That is war. And what you will see are countermeasures [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3393.02s)]
*  to some of these new capabilities very soon. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3397.02s)]
*  Already, electromagnetic warfare is massive there in terms of counter drone. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3399.78s)]
*  But directed energy is kind of right on the horizon [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3404.02s)]
*  in terms of counter drone and counter missile, missile defense and so forth. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3407.14s)]
*  So, you know, what the way I view it is different from, I think, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3412.18s)]
*  what kind of the conventional wisdom. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3415.94s)]
*  I don't see a fundamental change in the nature of war. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3417.94s)]
*  I see an evolving character of warfare. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3420.34s)]
*  And we're going to need not just like nifty little drones. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3422.58s)]
*  We're going to need a lot of nifty little drones and swarm drones and everything. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3425.78s)]
*  But we're going to need them as well as some of our more traditional capabilities [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3429.1800000000003s)]
*  like mobile protected firepower and infantry, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3432.98s)]
*  because what you see in Ukraine is glimpses of what you might say is a future war. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3436.42s)]
*  But you also see glimpses of World War One and glimpses of World War Two. Right. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3442.1400000000003s)]
*  And new forms of warfare typically don't replace the old. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3447.02s)]
*  They're grafted onto the old. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3451.5800000000004s)]
*  And I think we have to remember that, you know, and and and I think I hope we don't rush headlong [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3453.62s)]
*  into the nifty thing, you know, and by the way, if you're going to throw, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3459.94s)]
*  you know, fly a low, slow, low payload drone, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3463.62s)]
*  you know, they can only go a short distance. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3468.66s)]
*  Who gets them there? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3470.8199999999997s)]
*  They got to get there on a ship. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3472.2599999999998s)]
*  They've got to get there as part of a, you know, a mechanized task force, maybe or whatever. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3473.9s)]
*  So it's going to be how we combine these capabilities, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3478.46s)]
*  not like one capability that's going to provide the answer to future war. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3482.42s)]
*  Russian nuclear capability. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3487.98s)]
*  A lot of that equipment apparently relied on Ukrainian technology, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3489.86s)]
*  Ukrainian to maintain those systems, which they haven't been maintaining them. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3493.98s)]
*  So I guess the question is, what how how effective are those systems? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3498.14s)]
*  How worried about them should we be? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3502.82s)]
*  How likely is Putin to use them if his backs against the wall? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3505.3s)]
*  OK, great. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3509.22s)]
*  I did an episode of Honestly about this when Putin was first threatening [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3509.98s)]
*  using nuclear weapons. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3515.06s)]
*  So if you can go back in the honestly archives for that. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3516.46s)]
*  And we had more of a detailed discussion of it then. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3519.7s)]
*  But I don't know about the strategic forces, what you know, what shape they're in. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3523.58s)]
*  I mean, somebody knows, I think, in our government, probably a lot better than I do. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3527.14s)]
*  But they do have a vast amount of, you know, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3531.18s)]
*  what people call tactical nuclear weapons, right? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3535.26s)]
*  And and lower yield nuclear weapons. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3538.46s)]
*  We sort of disarmed in that area, right? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3541.9s)]
*  I think we have like, I think, scores of them. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3544.38s)]
*  They have maybe a few thousand of them. Right. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3546.46s)]
*  And so so what those weapons do for Putin is they allow him [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3549.5s)]
*  to to pursue a doctrine called escalation, domination or escalate to deescalate. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3555.18s)]
*  And what that Russian doctrine is, is that if they face defeat [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3561.02s)]
*  or if they think that they could need to use a nuclear weapon [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3565.06s)]
*  to sue for peace on favorable terms, they'll use a tactical nuclear weapon [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3568.46s)]
*  and then pose the United States with a dilemma and ultimatum really. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3573.78s)]
*  Hey, what's it going to be? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3577.82s)]
*  Sue for peace on our terms or nuclear Armageddon. Right. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3579.14s)]
*  So what we did in recognizing this is in 2018, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3583.38s)]
*  we conducted the nuclear posture review. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3587.46s)]
*  And it's worth taking a look at it's all this information is in there [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3590.38s)]
*  and unclassified document. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3593.74s)]
*  And we said we need to have the same that same kind of flexible [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3595.7799999999997s)]
*  flexibility and response like the old, you know, 1960s doctrine [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3600.3799999999997s)]
*  of flexible response. Right. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3603.74s)]
*  And we needed to develop kind of a new range of capabilities [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3605.3399999999997s)]
*  and recapitalize some of our older capabilities. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3608.4599999999996s)]
*  For example, a submarine launched nuclear capable cruise missile. Right. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3611.02s)]
*  Which we funded the Biden administration defunded it. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3616.22s)]
*  But I think they refunded it. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3620.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure. I can't remember. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3621.62s)]
*  But but so the key is to deter the unthinkable. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3622.86s)]
*  Will Putin use it? No, I don't think so. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3626.82s)]
*  Now you have to take it seriously when he threatens it. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3630.2200000000003s)]
*  But is a tactical nuclear weapon usable in Ukraine? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3632.54s)]
*  I don't think so. The winds blow to the east. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3635.82s)]
*  The Russian army can't fight very well in a non-radiological environment. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3639.2200000000003s)]
*  How are they going to fight in a radiological environment? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3642.46s)]
*  You know, will Ukraine stop fighting? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3644.7400000000002s)]
*  Will the world stop fighting if he uses a nuclear weapon? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3647.26s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3649.54s)]
*  I think he becomes North Korea on the Volga, if that happens, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3650.66s)]
*  a real pariah state, you know, and and so I also think we could tell him [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3654.7s)]
*  if you use the weapon, it's a suicide weapon, you know, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3659.8199999999997s)]
*  and we don't have to use nuclear weapons to make it a suicide weapon, you know. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3662.74s)]
*  And and I think that, you know, there are all sorts of options [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3666.7s)]
*  we would have, for example, to maybe destroy every Russian, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3670.14s)]
*  you know, military capability outside the borders of the country. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3673.94s)]
*  You know, maybe in, you know, in a couple of days, we could do that, I think. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3676.94s)]
*  So I think, you know, it's really important to deter [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3680.3799999999997s)]
*  through the capabilities you have, but also, you know, a recognition [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3684.7799999999997s)]
*  that you could use those capabilities and have the will to do it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3688.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think I don't think he would do it. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3693.06s)]
*  I think it's always got left right now is rattling the nuclear saber. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3694.3399999999997s)]
*  And that's why he's doing it so frequently. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3698.14s)]
*  We're having other people do it to get us nervous about it. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3701.02s)]
*  Well, it's nice to end on a note that there's not going to be Armageddon. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3703.74s)]
*  I didn't plan it that way. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3707.66s)]
*  Can I say one positive? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3708.94s)]
*  I want to say that was an up note. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3710.26s)]
*  An up note. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3712.34s)]
*  Hey, I'm really optimistic, by the way, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3713.62s)]
*  because I do think that Trump, you know, for all his faults and everything, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3716.62s)]
*  he has a very positive agenda that I think could unleash the potential of our economy. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3720.02s)]
*  So even if you don't like, you know, a lot of what Trump does, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3724.58s)]
*  deregulation, you got to be for that. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3728.34s)]
*  You've got to be for streamlining government. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3730.38s)]
*  I think, you know, he's going to try to invigorate our industrial base. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3732.26s)]
*  And what I've been trying to say to our friends abroad is, hey, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3736.38s)]
*  don't try to Trump proof the world, man. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3738.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. Because a lot of what you care about, energy security, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3741.2999999999997s)]
*  Chinese economic aggression, supply chain resilience, your own industrial basis. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3744.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what Trump cares about. Partner with him on it. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3749.14s)]
*  Let's work together on it. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3751.46s)]
*  So I think you're starting to see a little bit of that attitude [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3752.8999999999996s)]
*  with the visits to the to the royal court in Mar-a-Lago. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3755.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I'm hoping that that does that generates a sense of optimism [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3759.66s)]
*  in the free world, which is what we need these days. Right. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3764.58s)]
*  And when I look at us from the outside, we're ugly. Right. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3768.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, we're everything's in the open. Right. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3772.78s)]
*  We're divided and everything. It's vitriolic at times. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3774.7400000000002s)]
*  But, you know, those dictatorships, they're actually very brittle. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3777.54s)]
*  They look strong outside, but they're very brittle. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3781.06s)]
*  Look at how weak Russia is. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3783.38s)]
*  Look at China's economy right now and the difficulties that they have. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nqmyxXgyY&t=3785.1400000000003s)]
