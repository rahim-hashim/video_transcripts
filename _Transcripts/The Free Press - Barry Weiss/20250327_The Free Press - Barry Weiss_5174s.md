For the last quarter of a century, an Italian macher from New Jersey has been one of the most powerful people in the United States. If you’re a certain type of nerdy, obsessive, legally inclined conservative, he’s basically Taylor Swift. But most people don’t know who he is because, well, he doesn’t want them to know.

He has never held or sought political office. He does not hail from Silicon Valley or Wall Street. He is not a writer, pundit, or political aide. He rarely does interviews. And yet his influence is hard to understate. People in power—particularly presidents—trust and listen to him.

I’m talking about Leonard Leo, the animating force behind the Federalist Society and the key node of a growing network of conservative groups aiming to reshape the culture and the country.

Whether you’ve heard of him or not, he has no doubt directly affected your life in some way.

Leo is the person who counseled George W. Bush to appoint Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito. He had an arguably even greater influence on President Trump. Trump was new to Washington when he first became president. Leo, on the other hand, knew everyone in town. Leo counseled Trump and helped pick and prepare Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett for confirmation.

And that’s just the Supreme Court. Leo has cultivated talent across every level of the judicial system.

Leo understands the levers of Washington. He understands how Congress works, how the press works, and most importantly, how the courts work. He is, in a sense, the architect of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority—the one that overturned Roe v. Wade—which means he has changed American history, for better or worse, depending on your worldview.

Today on Honestly, I ask Leo about all of it: his relationship with Trump and their falling-out (though he disputes this characterization), and how he understands the divide on the right between the old guard like himself and the new characters like Elon Musk and RFK Jr.

I also ask about his so-called dark money groups, a $1.6 billion gift he was given, and the criticism he gets for wielding power and influence of this magnitude.

I ask about Trump’s willingness to defy the courts, if Leo even sees it that way, and if it alarms him. I ask about Trump’s controversial moves like sending accused gang members to El Salvador, and what those choices mean legally. I ask why MAGA has rejected Amy Coney Barrett, and whether gay marriage is settled law—not that I have any vested interest in this one. And most importantly, I ask whether the Supreme Court can remain above the fray.

It was such an original and enlightening conversation that we’re doing something we basically never do: publishing an entire edited transcript of our interview, which comes to some 13,000 words, only for paid subscribers.

# The Man Who Stacked the Supreme Court | Leonard Leo Meets Bari Weiss
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=0.0s)]
*  For the last quarter of a century, an Italian maher from New Jersey has been one of the most powerful people in the United States. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4.0s)]
*  Now, if you're a certain type of nerdy, obsessive, legally inclined conservative or libertarian, he's sort of like Taylor Swift. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=11.0s)]
*  But most Americans don't know who he is. Well, that's because he doesn't want them to know. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=19.0s)]
*  He has never held or sought political office. He doesn't hail from Silicon Valley or Wall Street. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=24.0s)]
*  He's not a writer, a pundit or a political aide. He rarely does interviews. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=29.0s)]
*  And yet his influence over the country is hard to understate. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=34.0s)]
*  People in power, particularly presidents of the United States, trust and listen to him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=38.0s)]
*  I am talking about Leonard Leo, the animating force behind the Federalist Society [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=45.0s)]
*  and the key node of a growing network of conservative groups aiming to reshape the culture and the country. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=50.0s)]
*  Whether you've heard of Leonard Leo or not, he has no doubt directly affected your life in some way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=57.0s)]
*  And that's because he has had tremendous influence over who sits on the judicial bench. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=63.0s)]
*  Leo is the person who counseled George W. Bush to appoint Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=69.0s)]
*  And he had arguably an even greater influence on President Trump. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=76.0s)]
*  In his first term, Trump was new to Washington. But Leo, on the other hand, knew everyone in town. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=81.0s)]
*  He counseled Trump and helped pick and prepare Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett for confirmation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=86.0s)]
*  And that's just the Supreme Court. Leo has cultivated talent across every level of the judicial system. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=94.0s)]
*  He understands how to move the levers in Washington. He understands how Congress works, how the press works, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=102.0s)]
*  and most importantly, how the courts work. He is, in a sense, the architect of the Supreme Court's conservative majority, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=108.0s)]
*  the one that overturned Roe v. Wade, which means he has changed American history, for better or worse, depending on your worldview. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=115.0s)]
*  Today on Honestly, I ask Leo about all of it, his relationship with Trump and their falling out, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=123.0s)]
*  although he disputes that characterization. I ask him about the new divisions on the right between the old guard like himself [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=129.0s)]
*  and the new characters in the MAGA coalition, people like Elon Musk and RFK Jr. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=136.0s)]
*  I ask about his so-called dark money groups, the $1.6 billion gift he was given, and whether or not that has been a gift or a burden. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=141.0s)]
*  I also ask him about the criticism he gets for wielding power and influence of this magnitude. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=151.0s)]
*  We also discuss Trump's seeming willingness to defy the courts, if this alarms him, if he even sees it that way. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=157.0s)]
*  I ask him about Trump's most controversial moves, like sending accused gang members back to El Salvador, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=163.0s)]
*  reinstituting TikTok, and what those kinds of choices mean from a legal perspective. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=170.0s)]
*  I ask why MAGA has recently turned against Amy Coney Barrett, of all people. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=176.0s)]
*  And if, not that I have any vested interest in this one, gay marriage is a settled matter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=182.0s)]
*  I think most importantly, and the reason I was so eager to have this conversation, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=187.0s)]
*  is in a moment of institutional crisis in American life, the court has been the thing that has seemed beyond the fray. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=191.0s)]
*  But could that be changing too? I put all of these questions and so many more to Leonard Leo. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=200.0s)]
*  He rarely gives interviews. This is a very wide-ranging one, and I urge you to watch the whole thing. Stay with us. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=206.0s)]
*  Leonard Leo, welcome to Honestly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=219.0s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=221.0s)]
*  Okay, Leonard Leo, you're not a practicing lawyer. You're not a legal scholar, although you're very erudite. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=222.0s)]
*  You're not a lobbyist. You're not an elected official. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=229.0s)]
*  But many people consider you the most powerful figure in the legal landscape in America. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=232.0s)]
*  Clarence Thomas once said, and he was sort of only half-joking, that you're the third most powerful person in the world, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=239.0s)]
*  I guess probably second to maybe the president and the pope. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=246.0s)]
*  There's the famous line from Office Space, which is, what would you say you do here? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=249.0s)]
*  And the question I want to open with is simply, what's your job? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=255.0s)]
*  What do you do in the world for someone that's coming to this conversation with little idea about who you are? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=258.0s)]
*  I build talent pipelines. I build networks and infrastructure. Started doing that with the law. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=264.0s)]
*  So I'm not actually all that powerful. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=273.0s)]
*  What's powerful are all the people that are behind those networks and those talent pipelines. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=278.0s)]
*  Because those are the people who change our culture, change society, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=283.0s)]
*  transform the law and the courts in a lot of really big and important ways. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=288.0s)]
*  But that's what I do. I create that connective tissue between people. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=292.0s)]
*  I try to figure out what talents people have, who they can work with, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=297.0s)]
*  and then try to find ways to deploy them to change society. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=301.0s)]
*  So you have a massive network of different organizations that are all sort of connected in a web. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=308.0s)]
*  But the original node in the network is the Federalist Society, as you mentioned. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=313.0s)]
*  Starts in 1982, three Yale Law students. You come on in 1986. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=317.0s)]
*  You turn, you decide not to go into a law firm. I believe you had clerked at that point. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=323.0s)]
*  You had gone to law school. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=328.0s)]
*  Fast forward four decades, right? About four decades. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=331.0s)]
*  Five of the nine justices on the Supreme Court are affiliated with the Federalist Society. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=335.0s)]
*  How did you pull this off? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=340.0s)]
*  Well, I think part of the success of the society itself, the Federalist Society itself, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=343.0s)]
*  was a few different things. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=349.0s)]
*  And they're ingredients that I think go into any successful network or talent pipeline. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=351.0s)]
*  One is you have to have a set of very clear principles. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=356.0s)]
*  Very clear principles. What do you believe in? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=362.0s)]
*  And the Federalist Society had that from the very start in 1982. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=365.0s)]
*  A very clear statement of purpose. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=369.0s)]
*  Secondly... [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=371.0s)]
*  And what is that statement of purpose? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=372.0s)]
*  That the state exists to preserve freedom, that it's the province and the duty of the judiciary [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=374.0s)]
*  to say what the law is and not what it should be, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=378.0s)]
*  and that we have an abiding commitment to what I would call the structural constitution. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=381.0s)]
*  Separation of powers, checks and balances, federalism. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=386.0s)]
*  Those structural protections, those limits on national power, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=390.0s)]
*  ultimately would protect the dignity and worth of the human person. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=393.0s)]
*  And that's essentially what the Federalist Society stands for. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=396.0s)]
*  And there'll be disagreements on various policy issues, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=399.0s)]
*  but ultimately that's the glue that holds everybody together. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=402.0s)]
*  The other glue that holds everybody together is very relational and personal. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=405.0s)]
*  Think about it as sort of, I guess, a foxhole, right? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=409.0s)]
*  So if you go to war and you're in a foxhole, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=413.0s)]
*  are you going to climb out of that foxhole in advance? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=417.0s)]
*  If you don't know whether the people to your left and your right have your back [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=421.0s)]
*  and are going to do the same thing, no, you won't. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=426.0s)]
*  And there's a reason why we build small platoons [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=429.0s)]
*  and we wear the same uniforms when nations are at war, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=432.0s)]
*  and it's because you want to build those relationships, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=437.0s)]
*  that camaraderie and that trust amongst people. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=440.0s)]
*  You bring up the image of war, so I'm going to go with it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=443.0s)]
*  You've talked about how your goal, and this is something Axios reported, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=446.0s)]
*  I think they got a tape of you saying it, is to crush liberal dominance. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=450.0s)]
*  Say a little bit more about that. How's that war going? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=455.0s)]
*  Would you describe that as the Leonard Leo aim [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=459.0s)]
*  or the aim also of the Federalist Society, and how are those two things distinctive? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=464.0s)]
*  It's my aim. It's what I have always... [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=470.0s)]
*  Desired. Since you were a Boy Scout. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=476.0s)]
*  ...desired, and it's what I believe in. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=479.0s)]
*  And first, I think you have to define the term. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=482.0s)]
*  So crush liberal dominance. The key word is dominance. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=485.0s)]
*  And in that sense, the Federalist Society is also in the business of crushing dominance [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=490.0s)]
*  because the Federalist Society started with a deep-seated belief in the idea [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=496.0s)]
*  that there needed to be a robust dialogue and exchange of ideas about the law. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=501.0s)]
*  Now, that's not to say the Federalist Society doesn't believe in something [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=506.0s)]
*  because it has a statement of principles, and I've told you what those are. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=509.0s)]
*  But the concern that caused the Federalist Society to arise [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=513.0s)]
*  was this pervasive left dominance in the law schools, right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=518.0s)]
*  That completely snuffed out any of the sort of traditional legal thinking [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=525.0s)]
*  and really made it taboo to believe in that stuff. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=531.0s)]
*  Let's go back to that and maybe paint a picture for people a little bit more [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=535.0s)]
*  because I think right now people will think, hold on, conservatives dominate the legal landscape. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=539.0s)]
*  They dominate the courts. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=544.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem like there's liberal dominance, so to speak, in the realm of law. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=547.0s)]
*  Maybe they'll see it in Hollywood or in media. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=552.0s)]
*  Certainly people that listen to Honestly maybe suspect that that exists in media. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=555.0s)]
*  But in the law, I think people are going to be more skeptical. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=559.0s)]
*  So explain what you mean a little bit more there. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=562.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, liberalism is still pretty prominent in the law. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=564.0s)]
*  But going back to the early 1980s and the 1970s and before, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=568.0s)]
*  the left definitely dominated the landscape. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=574.0s)]
*  First of all, the law schools really only taught a very sort of almost Marxist, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=579.0s)]
*  nihilistic version of law, right? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=586.0s)]
*  And you see some of those same tenets or theories in the wokeism of today, right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=590.0s)]
*  Except it was kind of more in the legal landscape back then. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=597.0s)]
*  So law schools really had very little tolerance for a dialogue [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=601.0s)]
*  about what I would call traditional constitutional legal principles, right? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=607.0s)]
*  So the whole idea of what is the text and original meaning of the Constitution? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=611.0s)]
*  What other people might call originalism or textualism? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=615.0s)]
*  Yes. So there was none of that in the law schools. None of it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=617.0s)]
*  And of course the courts at the time were completely dominated by the left. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=621.0s)]
*  You had a Supreme Court that was about as overreaching an activist [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=627.0s)]
*  as we'd ever seen in our history. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=633.0s)]
*  And then you had bar associations and large law firms that, again, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=636.0s)]
*  were very dominated by the left. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=644.0s)]
*  And all of this apparatus, right, all of this infrastructure was basically, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=646.0s)]
*  for lack of a better way of putting it, premised on the idea that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=652.0s)]
*  law was a tool for social engineering. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=657.0s)]
*  And so the ends justify the means, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=660.0s)]
*  we're just going to use the law as a way of pushing a social [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=663.0s)]
*  and cultural agenda that we wanted. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=667.0s)]
*  And Federalist society came along and said, well, wait a minute. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=669.0s)]
*  That's not what the law is all about. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=672.0s)]
*  And all of these structural protections in our Constitution [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=675.0s)]
*  and all these limits on various parts of government, including courts, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=678.0s)]
*  are really important for protecting freedom [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=683.0s)]
*  and causing personal responsibility to flourish and so on. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=685.0s)]
*  So that came along. But it was a slog, right? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=689.0s)]
*  And because you had almost no, very few scholars and academics in the law [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=693.0s)]
*  who were anything but liberal, you had very, very few judges [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=702.0s)]
*  who were moderate or conservative. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=707.0s)]
*  You had a very domineering, left-domineering profession and academy back then. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=712.0s)]
*  Now that started to change in the Reagan administration [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=719.0s)]
*  because you had President Reagan appointing people like Edwin Meese [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=723.0s)]
*  to the Justice Department and judges like Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=729.0s)]
*  to the courts. And so you started to see this shift, right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=734.0s)]
*  But it took, what? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=738.0s)]
*  Forty years? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=742.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. I mean, it took two decades for the ideas to become sort of serious, right? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=743.0s)]
*  Where the left was like, oh, wow, they're starting. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=749.0s)]
*  We need to grapple with this. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=753.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to need to confront this [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=754.0s)]
*  because these guys aren't like weaklings anymore, right? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=755.0s)]
*  There's this Marxist theorist. I just like the idea of saying that to you. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=759.0s)]
*  There's a Marxist theorist, Antonio Gramsci, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=764.0s)]
*  who talked about how the left or leftist radicals should sort of focus on infiltrating big institutions. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=766.0s)]
*  And his idea, right, after Mao was this idea of the long march through the institutions. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=772.0s)]
*  And I think it's impossible now to look at universities and think they pulled it off. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=777.0s)]
*  Like that strategy really, really worked. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=782.0s)]
*  In a sort of mirror image way, do you see yourself as having done something similar? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=784.0s)]
*  That's the approach. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=789.0s)]
*  So what you do is you look for choke points in society. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=791.0s)]
*  And the Academy was the one the left went for first, which was really smart, right? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=795.0s)]
*  Because all the captains of industry, all of the major journalists, all of the major politicians, right? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=801.0s)]
*  They're all going to be going to elite universities, right? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=809.0s)]
*  You're going to infiltrate those institutions. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=812.0s)]
*  You're going to feed them all this garbage. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=814.0s)]
*  And then they're going to come out and they're going to believe in it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=816.0s)]
*  And they're going to do what you want them to do. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=818.0s)]
*  So it was a really good approach. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=819.0s)]
*  Like their investment paid off. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=823.0s)]
*  Yeah, their investment paid off big time, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=825.0s)]
*  So they took the universities. You took the law? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=828.0s)]
*  Well, I think we are taking the law, yes. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=831.0s)]
*  In other words, we're looking, so for starters, the courts, the legal policy institutions in our country, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=834.0s)]
*  those are choke points where lots of really important decisions get made. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=842.0s)]
*  And every time a decision gets made in the law, but in particular in the courts [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=846.0s)]
*  or in some of these legal policy institutions, there are multiplier effects, right? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=851.0s)]
*  There are huge effects to every decision because they have far-reaching consequences. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=855.0s)]
*  So like universities, that's a choke point. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=859.0s)]
*  Now there are others. There are others. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=863.0s)]
*  And that's why as I've moved on in my career, you know, I've expanded the portfolio to include other things. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=864.0s)]
*  Corporate C-suites are major choke points of society and culture. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=871.0s)]
*  Private equity firms and banks. Production studios in Hollywood. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=878.0s)]
*  How's that one going? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=885.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting. I think there's starting to be a bit of a move there. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=887.0s)]
*  I think for two reasons. One, because the economic model in Hollywood doesn't work. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=893.0s)]
*  It's over. Yeah. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=898.0s)]
*  It's over. So basically, you know, you can disrupt. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=899.0s)]
*  Like you see something like Angel Studios as being that? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=901.0s)]
*  Oh, I think it's gone beyond that now. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=904.0s)]
*  Angel Studios was an early version. You now have institutions like The Wonder Project. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=907.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've been Jewish. I'm not familiar with it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=912.0s)]
*  You should go see House of David. I heard about it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=914.0s)]
*  On Amazon. Unbelievable production. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=916.0s)]
*  You've got Sycamore Productions, which is doing animation, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=919.0s)]
*  Ben Key, which is out of Daily Wire that's doing children's programming. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=922.0s)]
*  You've got the emergence of a number of new production studios in Hollywood. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=926.0s)]
*  And what's happening is all these people who are in sort of the traditional Hollywood production space, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=930.0s)]
*  right, it could be Paramount or MGM or whatever, you know, they're keeping their head low for years, right? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=937.0s)]
*  You know, they're not they're not necessarily conservatives, but they're also not leftists, right? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=942.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. They're like, wow, you know, how do I get out of here and go work for The Wonder Project or for, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=946.0s)]
*  you know, Sycamore or whoever, because now suddenly, right, new infrastructure [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=951.0s)]
*  and new talent pipelines have sprung up that are that are affecting the choke point of entertainment. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=958.0s)]
*  OK, let me let me ask it. It's a counterfactual. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=965.0s)]
*  If you could go back and say conservatives have a choice, they can take over the law or they can take over the universities. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=968.0s)]
*  What which one was more valuable to own? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=976.0s)]
*  Sticking with the crude caricature of like. That's a really tough question. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=982.0s)]
*  Boy, it's really tempting to say the universities, because when you kind of look at [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=986.0s)]
*  the incredible impact that their takeover has had on the culture, I have to say that that is a. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=995.0s)]
*  The law is kind of retail. Yeah, that's that's a wholesale approach. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1006.0s)]
*  That's that's a big box store. I mean, that's that's that's the whole thing, right? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1013.0s)]
*  Because you can really push the envelope there in a significant way. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1017.0s)]
*  I want to ask you one more question about. Can I just say one thing on that? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1022.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. You know, as we move forward in in our culture, though, you know, there are there is this question [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1025.0s)]
*  whether college education and universities, right, are going to be as important 25 years ago. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1033.0s)]
*  So well, their prestige is already dramatically diminished. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1040.0s)]
*  So if you ask me today, yeah, right. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1044.0s)]
*  Well, would you pick the university? That's a riskier bet now than it was when I first, you know, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1048.0s)]
*  started in my professional life as someone who is sort of adept at waging cultural, let's just say, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1056.0s)]
*  cultural warfare or network warfare. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1065.0s)]
*  You probably have an even more clever way to phrase it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1068.0s)]
*  But talk to me for a minute about how you pick your what you call choke points or how you decide [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1071.0s)]
*  where you should put your energy strategically. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1080.0s)]
*  And let me go a little bit deeper to what I mean, because I think about this a lot personally. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1082.0s)]
*  When I was at the New York Times, it became really clear to me how rotted things out, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1086.0s)]
*  how rotted out it had gotten, how much we could decide if they had ever fulfilled their mission. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1092.0s)]
*  I'm sure you and I might see that slightly differently. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1098.0s)]
*  But let's just say for the purposes of this conversation, how much they had strayed from at least their stated mission. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1100.0s)]
*  And there's still people that I respect and admire who work there, who still labor under what to me is an illusion [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1106.0s)]
*  that they will be able to be some kind of guerrilla counterrevolutionary force to pull it back to the center, pull it back to sanity. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1113.0s)]
*  My bet was more, I guess, a radical approach. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1120.0s)]
*  Like it's way too hard to make a difference here. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1123.0s)]
*  If anything, I'm sort of acting as a kind of fig leaf. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1126.0s)]
*  I need to go and start my own thing. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1129.0s)]
*  And I think that's one of the great debates of this moment for people that feel like for people that understand [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1131.0s)]
*  how many institutions that we once saw as authoritative have crumbled. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1140.0s)]
*  The big conversation, I think, is, is it better to try and reform them from within or better to go and start something new? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1146.0s)]
*  And I've wanted to ask you for a while, how do you know what the right answer is when you're looking at a given institution? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1154.0s)]
*  Well, in some cases, you don't have any choice, Barry. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1160.0s)]
*  Right. So in the case of the law, you really can't go off and create a whole lot of new institutions. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1163.0s)]
*  You're not going to like build an alternative system. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1170.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, oh, yeah, I'm just going to create some new courts. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1172.0s)]
*  Well, great. Have fun with that. You know, who's going to go to them? Right. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1175.0s)]
*  You know, so so so that doesn't work in the law as much. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1178.0s)]
*  Now, you know, you could you could build new law schools. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1181.0s)]
*  And and I have to say that, you know, that that has had some success. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1185.0s)]
*  But in the law, it's really hard to create new stuff. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1191.0s)]
*  So that doesn't really work there. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1194.0s)]
*  And, you know, I've gone back and forth on this with universities, to be honest. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1198.0s)]
*  So do you do you try to work within a Harvard or Yale or do you just give up? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1203.0s)]
*  And if the and if you decide to give up, then the second order question is, do I build a different university or do I give up altogether on the space? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1210.0s)]
*  And that's a tough question. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1221.0s)]
*  I know there's some people who have decided I'm going to build my own university or institution. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1224.0s)]
*  Now, you probably know that that's a seven hundred million dollar or one billion dollar proposition. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1229.0s)]
*  I know I'm one of the co-founders of the University of Austin and I'm learning that. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1235.0s)]
*  Yes. So you have to ask yourself, OK, what's what's the sort of cost benefit analysis of creating that institution? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1239.0s)]
*  Right. And so what I think will happen in the educational space is you'll get two or three University of Austin's that will crop up and they'll create a new [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1246.0s)]
*  I hopefully will create a new standard for that space. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1258.0s)]
*  But you won't necessarily get tons of new institutions. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1261.0s)]
*  You don't have to. Hopefully that puts enough pressure on some of the institutions that aren't totally off the deep end to kind of change around. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1264.0s)]
*  Entertainment and news media. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1272.0s)]
*  Those are areas where I've become fairly convinced we have to create new institutions. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1276.0s)]
*  So I'm very bullish on new production studios, new content creators in the entertainment space. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1281.0s)]
*  And I'm really bullish on creating small scale journalism units and new web based platforms in the journalism arena. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1289.0s)]
*  What you're doing. OK. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1298.0s)]
*  Real impact. I mean, you know, I don't want to be a commercial for you guys, but I'm pretty surprised at what I hear, for example, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1300.0s)]
*  from CEOs around the country who historically have read the editorial pages of the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1309.0s)]
*  and they probably still glance at them. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1317.0s)]
*  But there's a fascination with the free press and probably a couple of other independent journalism units which didn't exist before. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1320.0s)]
*  And they're having real impact. So in those spaces, I think creating something new is really important. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1328.0s)]
*  Other spaces like law, honestly, to some extent, medicine, where it's the startup costs are just enormous. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1334.0s)]
*  It would be really hard to create something new. And you do have to try to infiltrate. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1344.0s)]
*  OK, let's talk about politics and Trump a little bit. OK, I want to go back to. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1349.0s)]
*  So you were an adviser to George W. Bush. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1355.0s)]
*  You played a key role in the confirmations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1358.0s)]
*  And that was like a natural partnership. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1363.0s)]
*  And then we get Donald Trump, a very different animal. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1366.0s)]
*  When did you first meet President Trump and what was your first impression of him? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1370.0s)]
*  I met him in the spring of 16. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1374.0s)]
*  Just I mean, you never met him before. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1381.0s)]
*  He had not. I had not. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1383.0s)]
*  I had one outreach from some guy. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1385.0s)]
*  I don't remember who in late 15, I think, who was saying he was going to run and you ought to get to know him. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1387.0s)]
*  And it just didn't ever materialize. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1395.0s)]
*  And then in the spring, I was invited to a lunch. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1398.0s)]
*  Don McGahn, who was President Trump's White House counsel after the election, invited me to lunch at his law firm. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1401.0s)]
*  And that's where I first met him. We had a group lunch. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1408.0s)]
*  And then afterward, Don and then Mr. Trump and I talked a little bit about the courts. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1411.0s)]
*  And that was my first introduction to him. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1418.0s)]
*  What was your impression? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1420.0s)]
*  Well, he had he clearly had an agenda. Right. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1423.0s)]
*  And he was and my initial impression was, wow, you know, I've not met a presidential candidate in primary or general election season [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1426.0s)]
*  who is as committed to making the courts issue a big deal like he did. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1435.0s)]
*  Now, granted, he had the advantage of a vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat, which other presidential candidates didn't have. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1442.0s)]
*  And that's a big deal. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1449.0s)]
*  But he was very, very focused on the importance of the president's power of judicial appointment in a way that I never saw in any other candidate. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1451.0s)]
*  Well, he did something that I think it was unprecedented where he had you put together a list of people that he would nominate to the courts and released it during the election. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1463.0s)]
*  Like before he won the presidency. Right. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1475.0s)]
*  It was an audacious move, a risky move. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1477.0s)]
*  I remember the conversation that we had about it. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1481.0s)]
*  It wasn't my idea. It was his idea. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1484.0s)]
*  And he said, I want to put out this list. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1486.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1489.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1490.0s)]
*  And I said, well, I said, well, it's not this is not done. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1491.0s)]
*  It's never been done before. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1494.0s)]
*  And he said, well, does that mean I shouldn't do it? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1496.0s)]
*  And I said, well, no, no, it doesn't mean that. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1499.0s)]
*  But let me ask a couple of questions, you know. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1501.0s)]
*  And so we got into the discussion and talked a little bit about the risks of putting names out in advance, you know, the advantage of putting names out in advance. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1504.0s)]
*  And he was he was he and I asked him at that time, why do you want to do this? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1514.0s)]
*  Right. And he said, because I want people to know what I believe in this area. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1520.0s)]
*  I mean, it was just that simple. I want people to know who I am. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1526.0s)]
*  I think he said, I know who I am. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1528.0s)]
*  Did he have beliefs or was he outsourcing those beliefs to you because he knew that you were, to use a Jewish phrase, good at knowing who was kosher and who wouldn't be to a conservative base? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1530.0s)]
*  Well, as with everything in life, I mean, you know, they're oftentimes mixed motives. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1541.0s)]
*  I do I do think at some level he he chafed at the idea of liberal activist judges. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1547.0s)]
*  He lived in New York. You know, there were a lot of problems with crime and the death penalty and other things at the time that he was in the city. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1555.0s)]
*  The city was falling apart in a lot of different ways. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1563.0s)]
*  The rights revolution was really wreaking havoc on cities. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1565.0s)]
*  So I always assumed that it was his experience. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1568.0s)]
*  We never talked about that, but I always assumed that it was his experience in New York City with the ravages of this sort of, you know, left's rights revolution in the cities that kind of caused him to think a little bit about this. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1571.0s)]
*  It all became a little more crystallized to me after the election, because the week after he was elected, he summoned me up to New York to meet with him to talk about how we were going to winnow down his list so he could begin to think about, you know, who he was. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1584.0s)]
*  Who would and who he would appoint to fill the Scalia vacancy. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1598.0s)]
*  Right. And it was at that point that I said to him in that meeting, because I really wanted clarity. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1603.0s)]
*  Right. What? OK, we can winnow this list. But like, what are your criteria? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1608.0s)]
*  And, you know, I didn't know what he would say. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1614.0s)]
*  He could have very easily said, well, what do you think the criteria should be? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1617.0s)]
*  But that's not what he said. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1621.0s)]
*  What he said was, well, I want people who are extraordinary in terms of their credentials. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1623.0s)]
*  Right. Basically out of central casting to I want people who are, quote, not weak. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1631.0s)]
*  And then thirdly, I want people who are going to interpret the Constitution, quote, the way the founders meant it to be. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1638.0s)]
*  And I will always remember that language didn't prompt him. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1645.0s)]
*  That's what he said. And so that's how we started talking about the list. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1647.0s)]
*  Right. And getting it down, boiling it down. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1652.0s)]
*  So at some level, I think he did understand these things. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1655.0s)]
*  And was it partly a political bargain with the conservative movement? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1659.0s)]
*  Probably. Probably. Of course. I mean, that's what politicians do. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1664.0s)]
*  Right. That's that's at its very core of of of the political game and public choice economics. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1668.0s)]
*  And all that kind of stuff. But but but you know, at some level, I think he did understand that the courts had done damage to our country and something needed to be done about it. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1677.0s)]
*  And so that's how it all started. I mean, it was from the outside an unbelievably fruitful partnership. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1688.0s)]
*  You get Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and how many other Trump appointees does he have? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1695.0s)]
*  Does he appoint to the federal? It was like more than 200. Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1700.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's over over 200. I mean, dozens and dozens of honestly the most talented, intelligent, conservative, originalist jurists we have ever seen on the federal bench in the last 100 years. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1704.0s)]
*  So you're happy. Oh, yeah. Going back in time. Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1726.0s)]
*  Yeah. No, it's it's the what he did in transforming the federal courts is probably the most consequential thing he will ever do as a public official. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1729.0s)]
*  That will last 40 years plus. And if there is a revival in the originalist constitution, if there is a rollback of the administrative state and a federal power, it will be it won't be because of Doge. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1744.0s)]
*  It will be because you have jurists who finally put handcuffs on the administrative state and finally require Congress to do its job and not give away its power. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1762.0s)]
*  And that will all be in the hands of jurists that he appointed to the bench. Enormously consequential. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1774.0s)]
*  Say a little bit more about it won't be because of Doge. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1781.0s)]
*  Well, the problem with any executive branch that makes internal changes is that unless you are going to go to Congress and get legislation enacted to change the way the executive branch looks, they are more likely than not temporary fixes. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1785.0s)]
*  So what he what he's doing right now to scale back the size of the federal government will have short to medium term impact to be sure, because it will take an eventual Democrat or leftist who enters the White House quite some time to rebuild what's been stripped down. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1805.0s)]
*  But absent statutory mandates, right? Absent some changes in Congress, there's really nothing constitutionally constraining or legally constraining a future president from rebuilding that apparatus. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1825.0s)]
*  So really when you think about it, to the extent Doge has long term impact, it has to be more its saleability. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1844.0s)]
*  In other words, its appeal to our culture that this is what we want government eventually to look like, which ultimately would result in some form of political realignment. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1855.0s)]
*  But again, even that in the long term would be much easier to sort of circumvent or change than if you had Congress in the game fundamentally changing the way government looked. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1866.0s)]
*  Going back to that first. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1880.0s)]
*  And by the way, it's what you've got, right? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1881.0s)]
*  So if you can't get fundamental change through Congress, which you couldn't get because you need 60 votes in the United States Senate because of the filibuster, then you do what you can with what you have. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1883.0s)]
*  And that's what they're doing. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1896.0s)]
*  What was the biggest hard won victory of the first Trump term? Was it Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation? Or was it something else? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1897.0s)]
*  In the law? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1905.0s)]
*  Yeah, in your realm. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1908.0s)]
*  In my realm? Yeah, probably Kavanaugh. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1910.0s)]
*  I mean, I didn't think it was going to be that way when it started. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1914.0s)]
*  But yeah, that was surprised by how that shook out by what happened during that confirmation hearing. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1917.0s)]
*  We were waiting. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1926.0s)]
*  It's very funny. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1928.0s)]
*  So, so I warned our team at the beginning of the confirmation process that a shoe was going to drop. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1929.0s)]
*  We don't know what it is. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1936.0s)]
*  We've got to try to figure it out. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1938.0s)]
*  There's going to be something that they're going to drop on us because the politics of personal destruction was the art form, starting with really Bill Rehnquist and Robert Bork going back to the Reagan years. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1940.0s)]
*  Right. So it's just a matter of time. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1950.0s)]
*  Right. Bork, Rehnquist, Clarence Thomas, right. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1952.0s)]
*  All of these guys got pilloried with something at the very end. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1955.0s)]
*  So let me just ask you something quickly. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1959.0s)]
*  The process that exists, like, you know, when they chose Sarah Palin, right, or they choose any of these vice presidential candidates, they vet the crap out of these people. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1960.0s)]
*  They know everything, right? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1969.0s)]
*  Does a similar process exist for these? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1971.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Are you running that process is what I've always wanted to know. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1973.0s)]
*  Who is? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1976.0s)]
*  No, I don't run the process, but it's a big team effort. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1977.0s)]
*  There isn't one person who does that. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1983.0s)]
*  And usually a lot of the really super sensitive stuff gets done by the White House Counsel's Office. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1985.0s)]
*  But like before you're even putting Brett Kavanaugh's name on a list or Thomas Hardiman's name on a list, you've already done, you've gone back to like their middle school days. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=1990.0s)]
*  Whenever I've, whenever we've recommended somebody for a judgeship or whenever we've put somebody on a list, we've done all of that homework in advance. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2000.0s)]
*  Now, eighty percent, ninety percent. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2009.0s)]
*  So did you know that there was any cloud hanging over Kavanaugh at all? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2012.0s)]
*  We we didn't we didn't know that that would be what they dropped. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2016.0s)]
*  There was there were no indications of any of that. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2021.0s)]
*  We were, I mean, to be honest with you, the thing we were we were thinking they were going to try to go after him on was the credit card debt. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2026.0s)]
*  You know, there was these credit cards and he paid off the debt and they were going to try to raise questions about how that got done. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2034.0s)]
*  And there were very legitimate ways in which all that was done. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2039.0s)]
*  But but but that was what we thought they were going to try and drop on him. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2043.0s)]
*  So this came out of nowhere, absolutely out of nowhere. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2048.0s)]
*  And and and and so that was a surprise. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2052.0s)]
*  And obviously, you know, like the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, these kinds of allegations are very sensitive and very difficult to deal with. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2058.0s)]
*  Right. So it's not like a financial matter. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2072.0s)]
*  Right. The real human beings involved on both sides of the table. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2077.0s)]
*  It's very complicated, very fast. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2081.0s)]
*  And so it is it was a real crisis. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2084.0s)]
*  You know, but to to everybody's credit, you know, folks in the Senate, the president himself, everybody, you know, stood by Kavanaugh through the through the process. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2089.0s)]
*  Do you think it changed Kavanaugh personally? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2103.0s)]
*  I I don't know. I mean, I obviously I know him and he's a he's a good man. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2107.0s)]
*  And I don't think it changes the way he thinks about his job and what he's supposed to do. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2112.0s)]
*  Right. And I think going into it, he knew that the process could stoop that low because he had been he'd been around Washington. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2121.0s)]
*  Right. So he kind of knew that that was the politics of personal destruction was there. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2136.0s)]
*  Right. So I don't think it changed him that much. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2142.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, I think I think he's probably become a little more isolated in the sense that, you know, when you when you have that kind of prominence and exposure, you end up probably not being in public life as much. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2146.0s)]
*  But I don't think it's changed him in the professional area. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2163.0s)]
*  So you have this pretty productive collaboration with Trump for his whole first term. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2166.0s)]
*  Then you have a falling out. What causes the falling out? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2174.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know if I call it a falling out. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2177.0s)]
*  OK. I mean, people. Yeah. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2180.0s)]
*  I think that's a pretty neutral way to describe it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2182.0s)]
*  No. How would you describe it? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2184.0s)]
*  Look, I mean, as it's been reported, you know, we he was very upset about, you know, a number of people in his administration who he felt had really betrayed him and were, you know, succumbing to the left in various ways. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2186.0s)]
*  Rod Rosenstein, Jess Sessions, some of these other people. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2208.0s)]
*  And I think to some extent, you know, as The Washington Post, I think, reported, he felt that I was responsible for Rod Rosenstein's appointment, which is not correct, actually. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2212.0s)]
*  But but that was his inclination. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2225.0s)]
*  And and so, you know, we had one exchange about that. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2228.0s)]
*  But and then afterward, you know, obviously, I continued to be of assistance to the administration. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2232.0s)]
*  But but I always had a very simple rule, which is, you know, I'm at, you know, I will do things at the pleasure of a president, right, who wants to help. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2241.0s)]
*  And so if they reach out, I will I will respond. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2251.0s)]
*  And and so, you know, if if he wanted help, I wouldn't have refused it. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2255.0s)]
*  But but, you know, he he's got a new administration and I actually am really glad that he's built an infrastructure that doesn't have to involve me directly. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2264.0s)]
*  My whole goal, my whole goal professionally was to build a network or an infrastructure that could function and survive and thrive without me having to micromanage it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2282.0s)]
*  And and so really, that first Trump administration was the first time that, you know, we really were as intensely involved in, you know, building and transforming the federal judiciary. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2294.0s)]
*  And there was no guarantee that that that would perpetuate itself afterward. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2311.0s)]
*  And it did. And so I'm actually very happy with the way things are shaken out. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2316.0s)]
*  The people, the lawyers in his current administration are are all very good sort of conservatives who understand, you know, the conservative legal project. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2322.0s)]
*  And I have every confidence that that the judicial selection process will go will go well. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2335.0s)]
*  There's not as much to do now as there was in the first administration. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2342.0s)]
*  There are only there are only several dozen vacancies. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2345.0s)]
*  But but I'm I'm I feel very satisfied that the process has ended up where it is today, which is new, young generational shift in terms of who's doing this work. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2349.0s)]
*  There was a consensus, I would say, among sort of institutional conservatives when Trump won in 2016, that he was kind of an empty vessel without big ideas himself. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2365.0s)]
*  And that could be used to incredible effect if he was guided in the right way. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2375.0s)]
*  I think that there is a very different picture in Trump 2.0. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2380.0s)]
*  This is someone who has been stewing planning, has very clear ideas, many of them not conservative at all. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2384.0s)]
*  And many of those institutional conservatives that I would associate with the worldview of something like the Federalist Society have been sidelined. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2391.0s)]
*  And instead, you have figures in the Trump administration, people like I mean, the most obvious would be someone like RFK Jr., who I don't think you would say is anywhere on the map of what you would imagine would be in a conservative Republican White House and Trump administration. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2398.0s)]
*  Tell me about how you understand that. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2417.0s)]
*  Is this Trump's true worldview? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2421.0s)]
*  Is this, you know, the sort of emerging coalition that maybe would be out of reach for any other conservative Republican but is within reach of Trump? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2425.0s)]
*  Talk to me about how you see Trump 2.0, specifically some of the appointments. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2436.0s)]
*  I mean, RFK Jr., you feel very strong about the question of life. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2441.0s)]
*  He is a pro-choice lifelong Democrat. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2444.0s)]
*  I think what you're seeing in the Trump administration in terms of its appointments and where it's heading with policy is really a manifestation of a broader trend that's occurring both on the right and on the left. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2449.0s)]
*  So on the right, or on the conservative side of the ledger, you now have these tensions between some of what were sort of traditional conservative ideas about trade, role of government, foreign policy, the prominence of social issues in the political agenda, right? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2468.0s)]
*  And that is now sort of in tension with sometimes what I would call sort of the more populist movement within the conservative or right world. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2496.0s)]
*  And so what you see in the administration is to some degree an amalgam of these different forces. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2510.0s)]
*  You're seeing the same thing on the left. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2520.0s)]
*  You're seeing sort of traditional left progressive ideas, right? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2526.0s)]
*  But you're also witnessing a much more left populist view of the world, right? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2534.0s)]
*  And that's mixing politics up on their side. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2542.0s)]
*  Now they're not in the White House, so you don't see it in as clear or crisp a way. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2545.0s)]
*  But I think that's really what you're seeing in the Trump administration. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2552.0s)]
*  You're seeing in a much more practical context this sort of tension that needs to be worked out within the conservative movement or within the right between those traditional sort of ideas and forces and some of the more populist tendencies that have begun to arise. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2555.0s)]
*  According to Politico, and they're not always right, so you'll tell me if they're not, your PR firm, CRC Advisors, was part of a campaign to convince GOP senators to block RFK Jr.'s appointment. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2580.0s)]
*  Why did you feel it was important, that effort, to stop him from joining the cabinet? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2592.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, I'm not going to talk about who our clients are. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2598.0s)]
*  We're going to do. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2601.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2602.0s)]
*  But let me sort of describe to you what the conflict and debate was within the movement, because I think that's what's important. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2603.0s)]
*  So the pro-life movement is, in my view, at its lowest point in history. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2615.0s)]
*  You can see that in terms of... [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2628.0s)]
*  I'm just shocked to hear you say that after... [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2632.0s)]
*  Dobbs. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2634.0s)]
*  After Dobbs. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2635.0s)]
*  Okay, but look at what has happened after Dobbs. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2636.0s)]
*  You've had constitutional referenda in states like Ohio and Missouri, which are deep red states that enshrine abortion beyond what Roe would have sanctioned or permitted. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2639.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2656.0s)]
*  So the movement is at a weak point. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2657.0s)]
*  So in other words, just to clarify for people who don't know about Dobbs, Dobbs kicks it back to the states and voters. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2661.0s)]
*  The whole conservative argument was let the states decide, and you're saying the states are deciding, and they're deciding in favor of what some would call choice, what you would call pro-abortion. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2668.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2678.0s)]
*  So the pro-life movement is coming into the 2024 cycle in a relatively weak position. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2679.0s)]
*  Roe is overturned, a huge victory for the culture of life. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2686.0s)]
*  But what do you do now? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2691.0s)]
*  And how much credibility and reputational capital does the pro-life movement have? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2693.0s)]
*  And so you're going into the 2024 cycle with a movement that is trying to find its new voice and find its new way of doing business. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2700.0s)]
*  And so they don't have as much power in the political process as they used to. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2712.0s)]
*  And so as a result, you know, that social issue became a much less important issue than it was in many other election cycles. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2720.0s)]
*  In contrast, when you look at the younger populist generation on the Republican side or on the right, there were other issues that they cared very deeply about. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2735.0s)]
*  And for example, there is amongst younger generations that I'm sure you know, this sort of huge preoccupation with health and wellness, returning to sort of a more natural type of lifestyle. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2754.0s)]
*  Are you maha? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2767.0s)]
*  Am I maha? I don't think I'm not usually any. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2769.0s)]
*  Are you eating the beef tallow? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2772.0s)]
*  I'm not eating beef tallow. No. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2774.0s)]
*  So that's why a lot of them were drawn to RFK. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2778.0s)]
*  Yes. So on the one hand, the movement that historically would have been driving an appointment like HHS secretary is kind of in its more weakened state. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2785.0s)]
*  And at the same time, this maha movement, as you put it, they're sort of rising in prominence. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2797.0s)]
*  And so that's kind of they fill the void. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2805.0s)]
*  And that's what happened there. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2808.0s)]
*  And that was detention. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2810.0s)]
*  So you had, you know, you had pro-life organizations that were supporting RFK's nomination. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2811.0s)]
*  On the one hand, you had traditional conservatives like Mike Pence, right? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2823.0s)]
*  Former Vice President Mike Pence opposing his nomination. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2829.0s)]
*  And so you had this real interesting clash that took place. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2834.0s)]
*  But again, that going back to what we were talking about before, Barry, that that just all sort of reflects the sort of, you know, these sort of growing pains, right? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2840.0s)]
*  That exist in the conservative movement or in the right right now in terms of, you know, how does traditional conservatism and populism and nat cons? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2848.0s)]
*  How do they all sort of fit together? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2858.0s)]
*  What is what do they all believe in? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2861.0s)]
*  And look, the left is having these same growing pains, but just on a different set of issues. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2863.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or you could say they're sort of avoiding the growing. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2868.0s)]
*  I mean, the growing pains are the result of being in power. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2871.0s)]
*  I mean, they're necessary on the right right now. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2873.0s)]
*  And we maybe they're not on the left. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2876.0s)]
*  Trump, I don't know exactly how many days are we into the first Trump administration? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2878.0s)]
*  Sixty something. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2882.0s)]
*  It's felt like 100 years. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2885.0s)]
*  It's been a couple of months. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2886.0s)]
*  OK, it's been it's not 100 yet, though. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2887.0s)]
*  And it's been just the most dramatic action filled that I've ever seen. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2889.0s)]
*  Maybe, you know, you've been around a little bit longer than me, but I can't think of any beginning of an administration like this. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2895.0s)]
*  And many of the things that he's doing are not only politically controversial, but arguably, well, just be generous about this legally controversial. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2901.0s)]
*  They're definitely getting tremendous pushback from the courts. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2910.0s)]
*  And I wanted to just go through a few of them with you. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2912.0s)]
*  OK, over the weekend, the Trump administration sent hundreds of accused gang members to El Salvador, and it justified many of these deportations by pointing to this, at least as far as I know, rarely invoked Alien Enemies Act of 1798. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2915.0s)]
*  For people who want a whole explanation of it, Stephen Miller is going around on cable news talking about it. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2931.0s)]
*  This judge, James Boasberg, I hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly, blocked the deportation and the White House ignored him. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2936.0s)]
*  And they didn't just ignore him. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2943.0s)]
*  House Republicans at Trump's urging called for the judge's impeachment, and they still are as of recording time. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2945.0s)]
*  It got so insane that John Roberts put out a statement. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2952.0s)]
*  I'm just going to read it to you. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2956.0s)]
*  For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2958.0s)]
*  The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2965.0s)]
*  What do you think of this? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2969.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, this is all for a lot of different reasons coming from both directions. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2973.0s)]
*  This is a big mess. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2978.0s)]
*  So let me try to unpackage this. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2979.0s)]
*  OK, so first of all, I'm not surprised. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2981.0s)]
*  This is where the debate is. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2984.0s)]
*  So if we all put on our thinking caps for a minute, for the past two or three years, we've had Democrats and leftists all over the country using the I word impeachment and talking about criminal conviction of all sorts of conservative Republican judicial appointees. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=2986.0s)]
*  You know, sometimes saying that hospitality, which members of Congress accept in spades, somehow taints the decision making of these judges. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3004.0s)]
*  And so they've been waving around impeachment. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3014.0s)]
*  They've been waving around criminal conviction. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3016.0s)]
*  We had comments from, you know, Senator Schumer on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court talking about the whirlwind that was going to occur if if if the court overturned Roe v. Wade. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3018.0s)]
*  And shortly thereafter, you know, Brett Kavanaugh finds a potential assassin at his doorsteps. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3031.0s)]
*  So the escalation has been occurring for several years. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3037.0s)]
*  Are you drawing a connection between Schumer's comments and the attempted assassination? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3040.0s)]
*  That connection has been drawn by people in the media. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3044.0s)]
*  And I don't I can't say whether that individual was prompted by what Senator Schumer said. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3049.0s)]
*  But I can tell you that, you know, as Chief Justice Roberts's recent report on the state of the judiciary noted that as those kinds of incendiary comments, you know, make it out into the space, threats to federal judges increase. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3058.0s)]
*  So so there is a correlation whether that particular incident can be ascribed to Senator Schumer is beyond my capacity to know. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3075.0s)]
*  But look, the current vitriol right is not surprising and is something that in part is a result of an environment that's been conditioned by the Democrats and the left for some time. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3085.0s)]
*  So I'm not surprised by this. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3100.0s)]
*  For me, it's always a pragmatic question. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3103.0s)]
*  What are you seeking to accomplish or what are you seeking to achieve? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3105.0s)]
*  And, you know, me personally, knowing what I know about the courts and the sensitivities of people who serve on them, it's generally not a good idea to back a judge into a corner. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3112.0s)]
*  When you when you when you attack judges in certain ways, it makes it less tenable for the judge to do what you might want them to do. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3127.0s)]
*  OK, so for me, as a practical matter, it's really just a question of, OK, is this is this a good strategy? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3145.0s)]
*  Now, the constitutional system kind of, I think, anticipated this kind of sparring, OK, because they gave judges life tenure. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3154.0s)]
*  All right. So so and and the impeachment process, of course, is extremely, you know, laborious and complicated. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3165.0s)]
*  But people. But this is now a thing, right? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3172.0s)]
*  It's not just this isn't just like some passing wind. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3176.0s)]
*  It's like Bukele is talking about how we're living through a judicial coup. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3180.0s)]
*  Elon Musk, arguably, you know, maybe he's usurped you as most third most powerful person in the world, other than the president and the pope is talking about how we need to impeach lots of judges. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3184.0s)]
*  Yeah, this isn't. I take your point that I totally take your point that this didn't come out of nowhere and that one side used lawfare. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3196.0s)]
*  Now the other is coming and saying, like, how does that sort of circling the drain end? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3205.0s)]
*  Right. If it's just, you know, I'm going to punch you, you punch me, I'll punch you, you punch me until what? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3212.0s)]
*  Well, I think a couple of things have to happen here. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3218.0s)]
*  I mean, first of all, when you look at what the federal courts are doing right now with a lot of the Trump executive orders, I think in the past, I think over the course of history, certainly over the past hundred years, something like sixty seven percent, seventy percent of all injunctions have been imposed on the Trump administration. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3222.0s)]
*  Of all the injunctions that the federal courts have ever imposed, seventy percent of them are just on this administration's actions, which is really astounding. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3251.0s)]
*  And ninety two percent of them, by the way, were imposed by Democrat federal judicial appointees. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3258.0s)]
*  So so what's going on here? Right. Because that that statistic is kind of astounding. All right. What's going on here? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3263.0s)]
*  Either what's going on is their activist judges or what's going on is the Trump administration is really out over its keys. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3271.0s)]
*  Well, maybe it's maybe it's both. It might be a combination of both. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3277.0s)]
*  I think I think when you look at the temporary restraining orders that are being issued, you know, the whole purpose of a temporary restraining order, right, the whole purpose of these orders that these judges are issuing is basically to create to hold to hold to the status quo, whatever that is. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3280.0s)]
*  And so when a judge issues an order, a temporary restraining order and basically then tells the administration, by the way, pay out all these contracts, right, pay all out this money that or restore all these grants. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3300.0s)]
*  Right. Or turn a plane around. That's halfway or more to where it needs to be. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3316.0s)]
*  You have to ask yourself, is that restoring the status quo so that you can decide the case and not have any movement in one direction or the other? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3325.0s)]
*  Or is that putting your thumb on the scale and and causing, you know, one side of the other other to get an advantage? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3334.0s)]
*  And so what's happening here is on the one hand, you have an administration that looks at a lot of these orders and says this isn't these orders are not a pause. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3343.0s)]
*  These orders, some of these orders aren't a pause. Some of them aren't restoring the status quo. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3354.0s)]
*  And by the way, you know, Justice Alito alluded to this problem in one of the cases where, as you may remember, the Supreme Court declined to provide emergency review. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3359.0s)]
*  Right. Alito wrote a dissent from that saying, hey, look, you know, we got to be mindful of the fact that if there are federal judges out there who are really abusing the temporary restraining order process, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3373.0s)]
*  we we got to be ready to deal with that or we're going to have a real big problem on our hands. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3386.0s)]
*  Well, guess what? Right. You know, if you don't address that problem and address the quickly, you may well have a very serious problem on your hands. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3390.0s)]
*  A crisis like the one, you know, a rhetorical crisis, at least the one we're seeing right now. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3402.0s)]
*  So so that's that's that problem has to be sorted out. OK. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3407.0s)]
*  If we want to protect judicial independence and if we want to tone down the rhetoric a bit, then there also needs to be a recognition that the courts need to be very careful about maintaining the status quo when they're trying to decide these cases. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3414.0s)]
*  So that would be one thing that would help a lot. The other would be if people just got very pragmatic and practical about the situation. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3431.0s)]
*  I mean, look, you know, is the rhetoric we're seeing today going to get you what you want? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3438.0s)]
*  Probably not. So so, you know, it would you know, that's that's how to solve this problem. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3443.0s)]
*  I want to ask you just a few things very quickly. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3450.0s)]
*  I'm going to describe a bunch of actions that Trump or the White House has taken. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3455.0s)]
*  You just kind of tell me in the Leonard Leo court kosher, not kosher sending migrants to Guantanamo Bay. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3459.0s)]
*  Legal. Yeah, probably. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3468.0s)]
*  Shutting down the southern border to asylum seekers. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3471.0s)]
*  Don't know whether it's legal or not. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3476.0s)]
*  Threatening to take funds from sanctuary cities that don't cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3479.0s)]
*  Probably OK. I want to ask you about Danielle Sassoon. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3487.0s)]
*  Do you remember that name? Oh, I know who she is. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3491.0s)]
*  Yeah. So member of the Federalist Society. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3493.0s)]
*  She was the acting U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, and she resigned a few weeks ago after she was ordered by the Trump administration to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3495.0s)]
*  Was she right to resign? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3508.0s)]
*  Yes, I think the honorable thing to do when you're an administration official and you can't carry out what the administration wants you to do, the right thing to do is to resign. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3513.0s)]
*  That's that's that's sort of how I think you should do it. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3527.0s)]
*  And my recollection is that she basically sent a letter to the attorney general saying, Look, I'd like I'd like to meet with you to discuss this. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3532.0s)]
*  You know, the Southern District of New York here in the city is a really important U.S. attorney's office. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3542.0s)]
*  This is a really important case. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3546.0s)]
*  I wouldn't normally bother you, but I think this is one we need to discuss because it has political ramifications. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3548.0s)]
*  And and if you're not prepared or not willing to have a discussion with me about it, I am certainly prepared to tender my resignation. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3554.0s)]
*  That wasn't, I don't think, meant to be a slap in the face. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3564.0s)]
*  I think that's the honorable thing to do when you think you can't really pursue the administration's objectives. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3566.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, that was the right thing for her to do. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3572.0s)]
*  One of the things that this administration has done, and maybe there's precedent for it, I can't remember anything like it, is they are targeting via executive order and then just also rhetorically specific law firms by name. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3575.0s)]
*  One of them is Perkins, Cooey, another Covington and Burling. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3588.0s)]
*  These are four different things. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3593.0s)]
*  What are we supposed to make of this? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3594.0s)]
*  Because to me, this seems like troubling. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3596.0s)]
*  Why is he targeting specific law firms? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3599.0s)]
*  What is going on here? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3602.0s)]
*  Well, there are a number of different things at play here. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3604.0s)]
*  I mean, I think first of all, there's been controversy and conflict brewing about lawfare and big law for years. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3609.0s)]
*  So going back to the Obama years, there were law firms, big law firms, that were making it very hard for conservatives to take cases that they wanted to take, either pro bono or for clients. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3624.0s)]
*  On ideological grounds, leftist partners were not interested in having their colleagues take certain kinds of cases. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3644.0s)]
*  I mean, this was the case even, I don't know if you recall, the janitor that was trapped by the anti-Israel students. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3651.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3658.0s)]
*  He could, I mean, almost no one would represent him. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3659.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3663.0s)]
*  Because they didn't want to go to Columbia. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3664.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3666.0s)]
*  It was very hard to find law firms to do challenges to Obamacare. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3667.0s)]
*  It was very hard to find law firms to do challenges to the CFPB. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3674.0s)]
*  But why is he going after them? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3682.0s)]
*  Second Amendment. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3684.0s)]
*  But again, the point again is it's sort of like what we talked about in connection with criticisms of the judges. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3685.0s)]
*  You have this deep-seated history, right, in animus. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3692.0s)]
*  Right. I think what you're suggesting is that I'm looking at it with this aperture, and you're saying, well, you need to pen out in order to understand what's going on. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3697.0s)]
*  I think you do. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3703.0s)]
*  I mean, I know what the, I mean, the conventional. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3704.0s)]
*  But like, sorry, two wrongs don't make a right. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3707.0s)]
*  I mean, like, isn't it common sense? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3709.0s)]
*  I don't, look, I mean, the United States has a very rich history of allowing lawyers to represent causes that are unpopular or causes that you disagree with, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3711.0s)]
*  going all the way back to John Adams in his defense of the British soldiers from the Boston Massacre. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3725.0s)]
*  So, you know, that that is that is our history and that is our tradition. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3731.0s)]
*  But if you're asking me as a descriptive matter, well, how do we get here? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3736.0s)]
*  The answer is we got here because I'm asking you as a moral matter if you think that that is proper for the White House to be doing that, whether they should be telling, not telling law firms, investigating law firms, investigating law firms and creating a. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3740.0s)]
*  I think this is a nice way to put it, a very chilled atmosphere around their ability to do the normal course of business. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3758.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's funny because I looked at those orders and the orders are are are are pretty interestingly crafted. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3767.0s)]
*  Right. They they have all the sort of hortatory stuff about. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3780.0s)]
*  Well, you know, Jack Smith works here, you know, whatever. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3784.0s)]
*  And then they go on to say, by the way, you've got these really bad practices and, you know, we have sort of national security concerns with how you do with how you do business. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3788.0s)]
*  You don't have any objection to going after firms that are violating the law. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3800.0s)]
*  So so if a law firm is is has got dei practices that are violative of the law or if a law firm is doing stuff that really does pose national security problems, for example, representing certain Chinese companies that would be very problematic. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3807.0s)]
*  I have no problem with that. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3822.0s)]
*  You know, do I want do I want government telling law firms that they can't represent certain certain parties or or or, you know, that don't present those kinds of unlawful national security issues? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3826.0s)]
*  No, no, absolutely not. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3841.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I've been a I've been a leader of the conservative movement for a couple of decades now, and I can tell you, you know, I don't like an environment where, you know, lawyers who I know in these law firms have been suppressed from representing causes and clients that they really believe in. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3843.0s)]
*  And I really don't want an escalation of an environment where, you know, five, seven years from now, you know, turnabout right, you know, occurs. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3867.0s)]
*  And suddenly we're now facing a situation where, you know, good sort of conservative causes can't get, you know, legal representation or or some leftist administration tries to blackball any lawyer who wants to who wants to serve, you know, a conservative client or a conservative cause. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3879.0s)]
*  So those things do worry me a lot because we've faced it in the past. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3903.0s)]
*  You may you may know Paul Clement. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3909.0s)]
*  You may be familiar with him. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3911.0s)]
*  He's former Solicitor General of the United States. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3912.0s)]
*  You know, he he's got he got booted booted from two law firms, one because he, you know, wanted to do the Defense of Marriage Act defense and the other because he just wanted to do a Second Amendment case. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3915.0s)]
*  I mean, this stuff is bad. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3932.0s)]
*  And again, you know, you've got another pragmatic consideration that I always make right is, you know, turnabout. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3934.0s)]
*  You got to be careful about turnabout. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3941.0s)]
*  So when you're going to nail down a policy turnabout, meaning when the shoe's on the other. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3943.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3947.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3948.0s)]
*  You know, so so when you're going to nail down a policy and you're going to go forward with some protocol or you want to take some kind of action, you got to think carefully about what the long run implications of that going to be for you. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3949.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the test case for all of these. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3961.0s)]
*  And I think that if the shoe was on the other foot, there would be a lot of outrage about this. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3963.0s)]
*  I mean, OK, I want to move on. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3968.0s)]
*  I want to make sure I get ticked off because you mentioned Chinese companies seems pretty clear cut. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3971.0s)]
*  Congress passes a ban. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3975.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court, I think, unanimously upholds it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3977.0s)]
*  Then Trump says, I'm going to kind of ignore it. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3980.0s)]
*  What is the Leonard Leo jury of one? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3983.0s)]
*  I think I think I think that's a good question. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3987.0s)]
*  I think I think this one is TBD. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3990.0s)]
*  So so, you know, it's interesting. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3993.0s)]
*  The administration found sort of a gap in the law because they didn't they didn't give an extension, which they only could have done one time. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=3998.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4011.0s)]
*  For tick tock. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4012.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4013.0s)]
*  To work out a deal. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4014.0s)]
*  So the way I look at this one is we've gotten I think a month or so more to go or something. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4016.0s)]
*  I think it was a 90 day extension. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4022.0s)]
*  I think that's right. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4024.0s)]
*  And so we'll see what the tick tock, by the way, already had 200 something days to make a deal. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4025.0s)]
*  They didn't make a deal. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4030.0s)]
*  They I know. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4031.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4032.0s)]
*  I mean, I think this this play isn't over yet. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4033.0s)]
*  And I'm and I'm kind of watching waiting to see what happens in April. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4036.0s)]
*  So April is. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4039.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4040.0s)]
*  You know, and and what what what needs to happen in April? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4041.0s)]
*  What needs to happen in April is if there is no deal that, by the way, satisfies the terms of the law, can't be any deal. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4045.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4053.0s)]
*  It has to be a deal that satisfy the terms of the laws, which pulls China out of the equation. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4054.0s)]
*  Right. That's the key. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4059.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4060.0s)]
*  If we don't have that deal, then they got it. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4061.0s)]
*  They're out of here. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4064.0s)]
*  And if we don't have a deal, if you ask me, companies that are aiding or abetting tick tock ought to be subject to these massive daily payments. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4065.0s)]
*  Massive daily penalties and fines. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4074.0s)]
*  You know, companies like like, you know, Oracle and Google and so forth. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4076.0s)]
*  The administration, as you know, and as everyone who is listening to this knows, didn't just pardon January six nonviolent protesters. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4082.0s)]
*  They also pardoned people who had violently rioted that day. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4091.0s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4095.0s)]
*  But parting about the pardons. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4098.0s)]
*  Certainly, if you were pardoned and you engaged in violent behavior, I wouldn't be in favor of that. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4102.0s)]
*  I mean, so anyone who engaged in violent behavior, in my view, should should not have been pardoned. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4111.0s)]
*  One of the things that I see as an early warning sign, maybe not even that early, that things are not necessarily going in the right direction is when you see the right turning or parts of the right. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4118.0s)]
*  Let's just say parts of the hyper online right. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4131.0s)]
*  I'll be really specific. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4134.0s)]
*  Turning against Amy Coney Barrett as a kind of villain because she caucused recently with the liberal justices on one case or another. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4135.0s)]
*  You'll remember the details in a way I won't. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4145.0s)]
*  But they're calling her a D.I. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4147.0s)]
*  higher. I mean, I remember when she was confirmed and she was pilloried as like a handmaid and she was the boogeyman of the left. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4149.0s)]
*  Now they're sort of throwing even even her under the bus like she is not pure enough for I don't know what to say. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4156.0s)]
*  Trump loyalist, maga loyalist. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4164.0s)]
*  What do you like? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4167.0s)]
*  Where does that go? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4168.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, to give credit where credit's due, I was heartened by the fact that, you know, when asked about this, President Trump, you know, showed real respect to Justice Barrett and said she was very capable and, you know, smart judge and that she shouldn't be. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4170.0s)]
*  She shouldn't be criticized. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4185.0s)]
*  So I thought that was I thought that was a good sort of signal to his community about where he stood. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4186.0s)]
*  And I thought that was that was the proper sort of the proper answer. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4191.0s)]
*  And I think part of the reason he probably said that was because she is, when you think about it, probably one of the most prominent conservative jurists in the last hundred years of our court. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4197.0s)]
*  I mean, on every major issue that is of importance to conservatives, be it abortion, religious freedom, the administrative state, the Second Amendment, presidential immunity, separation of powers. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4213.0s)]
*  She has been a major figure in the conservative jurisprudential tide. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4227.0s)]
*  So so, you know, to say that she's a rattled law professor or who called her that again? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4236.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon or somebody in his world? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4243.0s)]
*  I don't remember somebody said she was a rattled law professor and had her head places where we normally don't put them. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4245.0s)]
*  So so I mean, that that's just not that's not consistent with who she is and what she's done on the court. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4252.0s)]
*  And look, the fact of the matter is we've always seen these small disagreements. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4261.0s)]
*  Right. And what we're seeing, we saw in this particular instance with Justice Barrett was a small, relatively small disagreement over what is really a procedural matter. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4269.0s)]
*  It wasn't. But as a civilian, someone who's on the outside of the law, I see it as one of many, many, many data points that point in a direct like that. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4279.0s)]
*  Tell me where the right could go. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4292.0s)]
*  In other words, if we take as I think you would agree with me that the movement that was once confined to the fringes of let's call it the the progressive movement in America came to define it, came to swallow it, went from the fringes in gender studies and anthropology and whatever to conquer huge swaths of American institutional life. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4294.0s)]
*  If you believe that that is what happened, I don't think you can kind of shrug off a phenomenon that is very, very powerful already online and already on platforms, which we know the president reads and we know Elon Musk is very involved with that. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4319.0s)]
*  You know, who knows where things are going a few years and I guess I'm I'm wondering how are you. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4336.0s)]
*  I'm not I'm not shrugging it off. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4341.0s)]
*  I mean, how worried are you about it? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4344.0s)]
*  Look, I mean, I'm. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4345.0s)]
*  Look, I'm. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4347.0s)]
*  But just by virtue of my own sort of background and my training and what I've done my whole professional life. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4350.0s)]
*  I'm always worried about the rule of law and threats to the rule of law and threats to the dignity and worth of the person by not respecting [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4356.0s)]
*  Either sort of traditional cultural guardrails or a constitution itself. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4368.0s)]
*  I'm always worried about that, and I've never believed and never will that those threats come only from the left. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4372.0s)]
*  They can just as readily come from the right. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4378.0s)]
*  So so that's that's something that, you know, is for any good conservative, right. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4381.0s)]
*  That's sort of built into who you are and how you think. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4388.0s)]
*  So I worry about that a lot. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4391.0s)]
*  And and there's good reason to be worried about the sparring that takes place now because of the environment that we're in. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4395.0s)]
*  I mean, again, I I I do. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4405.0s)]
*  This has been happening a couple of times in our exchange where I I I want people to understand the wide angle lens here. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4409.0s)]
*  OK, you know, we didn't just get to these nasty comments about Amy Barrett because Donald Trump was elected and because MAGA movement wants certain things out of the Supreme Court. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4418.0s)]
*  That that isn't the only that that isn't the reason why we're hearing this kind of invective. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4430.0s)]
*  We're hearing it because of a broader cultural problem. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4436.0s)]
*  OK, going back now, 25, 30 years, the gloves have been off in the law. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4441.0s)]
*  OK, the politics of personal destruction, the use of of of of laws, a weapon. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4449.0s)]
*  OK, that's been around and it's been used by both sides going back and forth. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4457.0s)]
*  And those are now the rules of engagement. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4465.0s)]
*  OK, a few years ago, you got a gift and that gift was one was for one point six billion dollars from a Chicago businessman. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4468.0s)]
*  I am not aware of any gift of this magnitude happening ever in American history. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4477.0s)]
*  Probably it has. What was your relationship like with the person that gave you that money and how are you spending it? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4482.0s)]
*  It's a lot of money to spend. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4488.0s)]
*  First of all, it's not a gift. What is it? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4490.0s)]
*  It's a cross. One point six billion dollars is a cross. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4492.0s)]
*  Yeah, because because because my job is to be a good steward of everything that Barry Side ever made in his life. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4496.0s)]
*  And that's that's hard. That's really hard. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4507.0s)]
*  What was his intention in giving it to you? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4514.0s)]
*  His intention in and he didn't give it to me personally, so it's not like I keep it in my sock drawer. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4517.0s)]
*  OK, would you like your sock drawer would have to be as large as this entire office? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4523.0s)]
*  But you are the sole trustee. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4527.0s)]
*  Yes, I am. OK. So so why why why did he do this? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4529.0s)]
*  He did this one because he was he is a great American. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4534.0s)]
*  He believes in this country. He believes in freedom. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4538.0s)]
*  He believes in the rule of law. He loves our Constitution. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4545.0s)]
*  And so he wanted to find ways of preserving that way of life. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4549.0s)]
*  That was really his his primary objective. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4554.0s)]
*  Secondly, and more operationally, he he he gave it to me as sort of manage because like like him, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4558.0s)]
*  I care very deeply about not only the battle of ideas, but about operationalizing and weaponizing what we believe in. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4575.0s)]
*  And so he he knew that consistent with how he did giving when he was active in this, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4585.0s)]
*  I would want to make sure that we were always doing things that were at the tip of the spear. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4595.0s)]
*  And and and so that's why he did it. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4601.0s)]
*  But you're like a venture capitalist and you need to go find really worthwhile things to invest in. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4603.0s)]
*  Are there enough of those things? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4608.0s)]
*  Sometimes there are and sometimes there aren't. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4610.0s)]
*  So when there are and there are things that are worth investing in. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4613.0s)]
*  So there are, for example, talent pipelines like the Federalist Society and the Teneo Network and Moving Picture Institute [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4619.0s)]
*  and other pipelines that are really worth funding where there isn't something in a space that can sort of receive funding and sort of, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4627.0s)]
*  you know, punch above its weight. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4639.0s)]
*  You have to create it. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4641.0s)]
*  And and and that's that's some of what we do. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4643.0s)]
*  One of the words that comes up when you Google Leonard Leo a lot as a sort of sister term is dark money. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4647.0s)]
*  And the criticism, right, is that you have an enormous amount of money at your disposal, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4653.0s)]
*  that you're very clever and you're capable of setting up all of these different nonprofits and the constellation, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4658.0s)]
*  the solar system you've been talking about. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4663.0s)]
*  And that while it may be perfectly legal, it's pretty secret and it's operating sort of in not fully in public view. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4665.0s)]
*  What do you say to that criticism? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4673.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, a couple of observations. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4675.0s)]
*  First, it's the left that invented that invented dark money. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4678.0s)]
*  If you go back and look at the origins of a lot of these structures that you referenced, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4681.0s)]
*  they were all really developed by the left and the left spends multiples more in so-called dark money than I do. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4687.0s)]
*  Secondly, it's not really all that dark in my case. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4694.0s)]
*  I think you can pretty much figure out what I'm going to be deploying assets to do. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4697.0s)]
*  I've said it pretty clearly. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4701.0s)]
*  Crush liberal dominance. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4702.0s)]
*  So, I mean, it's not like I'm operating in some closet and not letting anybody know what I'm going to do. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4703.0s)]
*  But thirdly and most importantly, and this is a point that I think you'll appreciate, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4708.0s)]
*  we have a really rich history in our country of anonymous giving. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4713.0s)]
*  The American Revolution, the Civil War, the women's suffrage movement, the civil rights movement, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4719.0s)]
*  and the LGBTQ movement were all, all very much funded by anonymous giving. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4727.0s)]
*  And there were people in each of those movements and foundations in each of those movements that did their giving anonymously. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4736.0s)]
*  Why? Why? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4744.0s)]
*  Not for the instrumental reasons that you might think, which is, oh, well, because they were afraid. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4746.0s)]
*  Okay. Or they didn't want to sort of attract press attention. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4752.0s)]
*  Yes, maybe some people. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4756.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4758.0s)]
*  But the real reason is because you want the power of ideas, the power of ideas to be tested [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4759.0s)]
*  and to be what drives a movement as opposed to particular personalities. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4768.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4773.0s)]
*  What really ought to matter to people is whether a certain way of thinking or a certain idea or a certain policy is the right thing to do for good reasons, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4774.0s)]
*  because it makes sense as a matter of tradition or history or custom or logic or whatever it is. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4784.0s)]
*  It shouldn't matter, right, who's doing it. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4790.0s)]
*  Okay. What should matter is the power of those ideas. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4794.0s)]
*  But that's the opposite of the culture we live in now, where cults of personality is the only thing that seems to attract people. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4797.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4803.0s)]
*  And so, you know, instead of thinking about, well, gee, does it make sense to have a U.S. Supreme Court that believes in originalism? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4804.0s)]
*  Does it make sense? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4814.0s)]
*  Does it make sense to have a Hollywood that builds family values-centered entertainment? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4815.0s)]
*  Instead of having those conversations, we have to prop up dark money overlords and we have to talk about them instead. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4824.0s)]
*  But that takes time and effort away from what really matters. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4831.0s)]
*  Who's your model on the left? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4835.0s)]
*  Who are you trying? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4836.0s)]
*  You're saying that this is exponentially like this model was created by the left. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4837.0s)]
*  You're just trying to imitate it. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4842.0s)]
*  Who is it? Is it George Soros or somebody else? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4844.0s)]
*  Actually, there is no model on the left in the sense that we're much better than anything they do. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4846.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4853.0s)]
*  Because for every six dollars they could spend, I can do it with one dollar. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4854.0s)]
*  Because there's so few, because conservatives are so hard up for cash? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4858.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just we've never had as much cash. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4862.0s)]
*  And honestly, we have truth on our side. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4865.0s)]
*  Okay, but the point is your side's hungrier. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4868.0s)]
*  We're hungrier, but also honestly, you know, I think our beliefs are more consistent with the natural order and that makes it easier. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4870.0s)]
*  We don't have time. Okay, okay. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4879.0s)]
*  That's a long conversation, but I think that's true. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4881.0s)]
*  And the other thing I will say is, you know, we just really do have an incredible pool of talent right now, an incredible pool of talent. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4883.0s)]
*  Do you think that you have too much power? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4893.0s)]
*  I told you I don't think I have anywhere near as much power as people think I do. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4895.0s)]
*  It's not about me. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4900.0s)]
*  I mean, what makes this movement flourish and what makes it so successful is it's a pipeline and an infrastructure of enormous talent. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4901.0s)]
*  That's what works. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4912.0s)]
*  See, the left likes to think there's some guy in the corner controlling all of this stuff, right? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4913.0s)]
*  A puppet master. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4918.0s)]
*  No, I'm taking the opposite argument. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4919.0s)]
*  I'm saying my belief is that this may be this. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4921.0s)]
*  This is definitely not something we were taught. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4927.0s)]
*  I was a history major at Columbia and this idea of like the great man view of history was despised and thrown out the door. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4928.0s)]
*  But I have come to believe at the late age of 40 that individuals, very, very determined individuals, a very small number of them can exert a tremendous amount of influence over the direction of things. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4934.0s)]
*  The only reason that's possible. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4947.0s)]
*  The only reason that's possible is because of the community that they build and the power that comes from that sort of intellectual and spiritual force from other people. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4950.0s)]
*  So what makes the conservative legal movement, for example, successful isn't Leonard Leo. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4965.0s)]
*  It's this massive community of highly talented, highly driven people. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4973.0s)]
*  OK, that's what makes it work. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4980.0s)]
*  That's where the power really is. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4982.0s)]
*  That's where the power really is. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4985.0s)]
*  OK, Leonard Leo, are you ready for a lightning round? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4987.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4990.0s)]
*  OK, good. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yH5GNe1Xqo&t=4991.0s)]
