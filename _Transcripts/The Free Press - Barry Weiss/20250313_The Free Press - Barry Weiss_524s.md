# Andrew Schulz on Shane Gillis and SNL
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8)
*  The other thing I've been thinking a lot about is, you know, Shane Gillis hosted SNL, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=0.0s)]
*  I think last week or the week before. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=3.46s)]
*  He was great. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=4.8s)]
*  And like, go back to 2019. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=5.8s)]
*  He's fired from SNL before I was at the New York Times then, I remember it, because I [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=9.34s)]
*  wanted to like get the first interview with him. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=14.38s)]
*  He's fired before he even gets on the show. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=16.6s)]
*  Now he's hosting it, like twice in a matter of a year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Like tell, you've not just had a ringside seat, look, he definitely, I'm sure there's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=23.92s)]
*  a French version of that, to the vibe shift in culture. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=29.46s)]
*  But like you've been a player in it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=32.82s)]
*  I would argue like had a hand in shifting it in a certain sense, maybe unintentionally, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=34.94s)]
*  like maybe that's not strategic, but you have. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  Talk to us about like how did that change happen? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=42.38s)]
*  Like what were the, like was Shane Gillis getting fired from SNL kind of like a high [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  water mark of the censorious age? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  I'm trying to think. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=53.74s)]
*  I think it, hmm, I don't know about like high water mark. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=54.74s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure just because Shane I don't think was known prior to getting SNL. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=58.7s)]
*  So it's not like it's a cancellation of a very famous person. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=68.18s)]
*  It was a cancellation of a person that didn't even have a base. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=73.34s)]
*  It's kind of more impressive that he was able to build his career after that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  It's one thing when you're like famous and you get canceled and then all these people [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=81.66s)]
*  who loved you are like, that's fucked up, they can ride for you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  There's this guy that nobody really... [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=87.78s)]
*  And now he has to go to, now he's got the scarlet letter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=89.33999999999999s)]
*  Like it's a really, I think it's a really impressive case study. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=93.94s)]
*  I don't know if, obviously he's fucking murdering, he's doing great right now, but I don't know [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=98.66s)]
*  if people realized the mountain there was to climb. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=103.61999999999999s)]
*  Right it wasn't like Louis C.K. who then had the email list and could distribute on the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  phone. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=110.74s)]
*  Yeah, like you're not even canceled. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=111.74s)]
*  You can't make like indie movies and get patted on the back in LA. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=113.3s)]
*  Like, you still got tens of millions of dollars and you could do whatever the fuck you want. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=119.58s)]
*  You could tour and do arenas whenever you want. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  It's like, are you canceled? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=126.78s)]
*  You're canceled from Hollywood elitist approval. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=128.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=130.94s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=131.94s)]
*  Sandra Bullock's not going to come to my birthday. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=132.94s)]
*  Boo hoo. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=138.22s)]
*  But what Shane went through is a very different situation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=141.02s)]
*  And you got people like going after this kid who doesn't really have money. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=145.34s)]
*  He doesn't really have a name. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=151.38s)]
*  And now he has this scarlet letter and he has to make a living doing stand up in front [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=154.3s)]
*  of people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  Luckily, with the internet, there are people really rally behind it and he built this great [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  thing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=162.38s)]
*  But there's a way that that goes south and this kid never does stand up again. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=163.38s)]
*  But how do we go from a culture where that was the norm to one where he's hosting it? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=165.5s)]
*  How do you explain the shift that's happened in the past five years? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, like just media or anything, like wrestling is a perfect version [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=171.61999999999998s)]
*  of it where it's just like this mirror to culture. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=175.22s)]
*  But like, I think that if you are successful and the people fuck with you, people don't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=178.38s)]
*  have a chance. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=185.06s)]
*  I mean, the networks don't really have a choice. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=186.06s)]
*  They have to do it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=188.06s)]
*  You know, like, so Shane, the people really fuck with and this show SNL wants to put people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=189.26s)]
*  on who the people really fuck with. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=195.54s)]
*  So if you have the people, you win. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=197.06s)]
*  You know, like, I think there's a lot of people that operate in like the traditional Hollywood [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=198.98s)]
*  systems and there's like maybe some security there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=201.7s)]
*  But you don't really have security because once you're on the outs with them, you're [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=203.82s)]
*  done. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=207.62s)]
*  But if you have the people, you always have security. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=208.62s)]
*  So that's been my whole thing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=209.62s)]
*  It's like, how do I make sure I have the people? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=211.34s)]
*  How do I have like a base? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=213.26s)]
*  And the tricky thing with that is like, sometimes a base is available to you that is an ideological [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=215.62s)]
*  base. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=223.74s)]
*  And if you're going to be authentic, you have to fight the urge to pander. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=225.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=229.38000000000002s)]
*  And like when you're being attacked, it's very easy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=230.38000000000002s)]
*  Like I have empathy for people who fall into an ideological base upon attack because I [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  just need some support. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=238.74s)]
*  And it's tough. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=241.18s)]
*  Like I've been I've gone through like attacks, you know, for shit that people were bothered [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  by, which I get you're allowed to be bothered by whatever you want. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  But it's just one of those things where I would go, oh, man, this would be so much easier [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=250.94s)]
*  if I was just some right wing MAGA lunatic or if I was just some lefty because the base [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=254.7s)]
*  would just go, yo, we got you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=259.86s)]
*  These people are crazy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  But then you lose your authenticity and the whole point of creating in this decentralized [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  space is you get to have your own fucking voice. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  But doesn't it shock you how many people choose the box? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=271.34s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=275.41999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=276.74s)]
*  No, they just want money. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=277.74s)]
*  You don't want to create. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=278.74s)]
*  You're not like if you're like a reaction channel, you just do whatever the fuck. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=279.74s)]
*  Like you just do whatever the fuck gets the views. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=284.94s)]
*  Like you're not like an artist. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=287.3s)]
*  You're not like creating something like if you want to create art and as like pretentious [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=288.7s)]
*  as that sounds. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  But if that's something you care about and you truly want to create it, then you will [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=295.86s)]
*  do whatever allows you to create that in the most authentic way. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  And yeah, like I grew up in like a fucking dance family. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=306.94s)]
*  Like my parents had a dance studio. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=311.74s)]
*  My dad was like a journal. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=313.48s)]
*  Like he cared about interesting stories and like he was a truly like authentic person. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=314.48s)]
*  My mom was as well. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=319.8s)]
*  And like I don't know. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  Maybe I'm lucky in that regard, but I at no point was like, oh, I got to do this to get [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=327.88s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=328.88s)]
*  And I get shit on by both sides because of it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=330.04s)]
*  And I get called a grifter by both sides because of it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=332.5s)]
*  And that is the cost of doing something truly unique. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=335.88s)]
*  And also just getting criticism is just the cost of success. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=341.48s)]
*  We have to we can't complain about that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=344.24s)]
*  But I think it's possible to grow up in that way and to set off wanting to, I don't think [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=346.48s)]
*  it sounds pretentious, wanting to do something original, let's say. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  And then getting a taste of the applause or getting a taste of the money and it transforms [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=360.72s)]
*  Or at least it seems to transform a lot of people. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=361.72s)]
*  But the question is... [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=363.6s)]
*  I think like this question of audience capture, this is what all of us are facing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=364.6s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you're an individual substacker or a podcaster or the New York [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=368.5s)]
*  Times like or Netflix, you know, who wants to make documentaries on celebrities in sports [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=372.4s)]
*  because that's what people want. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=376.94s)]
*  Like there's an inherent contradiction often between what the market rewards or what your [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=378.5s)]
*  audience applauds and rewards and what your values are. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=385.06s)]
*  You're right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=389.46s)]
*  So what do you do in that regard? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=390.46s)]
*  I mean, I have like a lot of guardrails for myself and for the free press. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=392.7s)]
*  How do you fight? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=396.9s)]
*  Okay, how do you fight? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  We actively publish things that we know will cause audience churn. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=399.41999999999996s)]
*  If you're looking for a rage bait, there are many other outlets for you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=403.38s)]
*  That is not what we're doing here. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=407.82s)]
*  What we're trying to do here, I mean, Monday was a really good example after the whole [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=409.67999999999995s)]
*  Oval Office meltdown between Trump and Zelensky. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=413.17999999999995s)]
*  We published five or six very different perspectives on what that was and on the new Trump policy [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=416.7s)]
*  toward Russia. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=424.21999999999997s)]
*  So what's the identity? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=425.21999999999997s)]
*  How do you maintain an identity for your brand while bouncing around? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=426.32s)]
*  Because the identity of our brand is truth seeking and our premise is you cannot get [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=432.32s)]
*  to truth in an echo chamber. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=438.04s)]
*  The only way that you get to truth is by sitting next to some. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=439.82s)]
*  This is what makes it so different from any newsroom I've ever worked in. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=443.6s)]
*  Sitting next to someone who disagrees with you, you still respect, admire them and collaborate [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=446.88s)]
*  with them. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=453.34s)]
*  There's certain guardrails like no one that works here is a bigot. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=455.17999999999995s)]
*  No one that works here, there's a fundamental belief in the American project and the idea [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=458.14s)]
*  that America is good and we are lucky to live here and we want to improve it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=462.97999999999996s)]
*  We might have different ways about how to do that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=466.78s)]
*  We set those guardrails really clearly. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=470.02s)]
*  But then inside of that, there's a lot of room for disagreement. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=471.85999999999996s)]
*  We think that our audience is smart enough. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=476.34s)]
*  They want to be treated like adults and they want to hear the steelman best version of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=479.94s)]
*  different sides of an argument. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=484.06s)]
*  That's a very rare type of person. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=486.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's very rare. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=489.26000000000005s)]
*  And tweezing out the kind of people that make sense here is really, really hard. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQJ7AMkWz8&t=492.98s)]
