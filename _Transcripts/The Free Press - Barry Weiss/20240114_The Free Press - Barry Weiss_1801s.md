Video Description: One hundred days ago, the world changed. October 7 has proven to be many things: the opening salvo in a brutal war between Israel and Hamas; an attack that could precipitate a broader, regional war; the beginning of a global, ongoing orgy of antisemitism; a wake-up call regarding the rot inside the West’s once-great sensemaking institutions; a possible realignment of our politics.

One of the things it has also been is a test. A moral test that many in the West have failed. That test of moral conscience is a continuing one considering there are still 136 hostages in Gaza. Two of them are babies; close to 20 of them are young women.

Across the Western world, these hostages have faded from view. And when it comes to the fate of the many young women abducted by Hamas and taken to Gaza, the silence from some corners has been deafening.

Today on Honestly, Bari argues that the groups you would expect to care most about these women and hostages—the celebrity feminists who are always the first to speak up in times of crisis, the prominent women’s organizations who protested loudly when it came to #MeToo, Donald Trump, or Brett Kavanaugh, and the international, supposedly “nonpolitical” human rights organizations—have said and done next to nothing about the murder, kidnap, and rape of Israeli girls.

What explains their silence—or worse, their downplaying or denial? 

When Michelle Obama, Oprah, Malala Yousafzai, Angelina Jolie, Kim Kardashian—and the rest of the civilized world—saw the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in Nigeria by Boko Haram in April 2014, within days they took to Twitter and demanded “Bring Back Our Girls.”

Why isn’t the world demanding the same now? 

It’s been one hundred days in captivity: bring back our girls.

# Bari Weiss: Why Are Feminists Silent on Rape and Murder?
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [January 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA)
*  I'm Barry Weiss, and this is Honestly. Today's episode is an important one, but it may be a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=0.0s)]
*  little hard to listen to. It also includes descriptions of graphic sexual violence, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=4.88s)]
*  so don't listen to this one with kids in the room. I want to tell you about a group of girls who were [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=9.76s)]
*  kidnapped by terrorists thousands of miles away. The girls were teenagers, and they were taken, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=15.92s)]
*  grabbed and thrown into trucks by a murderous gang, abducted from their families and dragged [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=22.72s)]
*  into remote hideouts. These terrorists, driven by an extreme Islamist ideology, were opposed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=29.04s)]
*  to the civilization that these girls believed was their birthright. The right to be educated, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=36.24s)]
*  the right to be independent, the right to chart their own destinies. And so they kidnapped them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  When the world heard the news of this faraway story, people were outraged and empathetic. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=48.16s)]
*  The First Lady of the United States saw it on the news. Those could be my daughters, she thought. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=54.08s)]
*  And compelled by what I imagine was a combination of maternal instinct and a sense of duty to speak [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=59.68s)]
*  out against evil, she took to Twitter and demanded, bring back our girls. Within days, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=65.36s)]
*  women around the world, leaders in Washington and celebrities in Hollywood, followed suit. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=72.8s)]
*  They knew that they had an audience. They knew that they had platforms, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=78.72s)]
*  and they wanted to do everything they could to call attention to this atrocity. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=82.48s)]
*  What I'm describing was the righteous outrage in the West in response to the kidnapping and sexual [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=87.2s)]
*  slavery of 276 schoolgirls in Nigeria when they were kidnapped by the Islamist militant organization [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=93.44s)]
*  Boko Haram in April 2014. Michelle Obama, Oprah, Malala Yousafzai, Alicia Keys, Angelina Jolie, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  Kim Kardashian, and the rest of the civilized world saw a story of good versus evil. And so [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=111.6s)]
*  they spoke out about it. The situation could not have been clearer, nor could the moral imperative [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  for those with power to do something about it. And power they had. President Obama wound up [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=124.96s)]
*  deploying American troops to assist in the search for the schoolgirls in Nigeria. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=131.44s)]
*  Nearly 10 years later, on October 7th, 2023, terrorists driven by an extremist Islamist [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  ideology kidnapped another group of teenage girls thousands of miles away. These men brutalized and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=144.72s)]
*  abducted the girls and many others, including soldiers, innocent men, women, the elderly, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=152.16s)]
*  children, and even babies. All told, there were over 240 of them. The terrorists took over [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=158.16s)]
*  these people, some of whom were still in their pajamas, into tunnels deep underground. This [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=166.4s)]
*  wasn't Boko Haram and it wasn't in Nigeria. It was Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=172.72s)]
*  the ruling Islamist factions in the Gaza Strip. And the people taken were Israelis. In this case, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  there were no viral hashtag campaigns. There were no clear and urgent statements from female leaders, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=186.72s)]
*  the kinds of feminists that so many young girls look up to and have come to rely on for their [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=193.44s)]
*  information about the world. No Michelle Obama, no Malala, no Emma Watson, no Greta Thunberg, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=198.64s)]
*  no America Ferrera. And I could go on and on and on. There has been no relentless rallying cry [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=205.92s)]
*  from our prominent women's organizations. Instead, there has been silence. Silence from the leaders of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=213.04s)]
*  the Me Too movement. Silence from the celebrities who spoke at the Women's March and in Time's Up. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=220.64s)]
*  Silence from those who denounced pay gaps and Harvey Weinstein and Trump's grab him by the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=227.6s)]
*  pussy comment and rape culture more generally. Silence from people who opposed Brett Kavanaugh's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=233.27999999999997s)]
*  nomination to the Supreme Court. Silence, save one weak statement 55 days after October 7th, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=239.6s)]
*  from UN Women, a group whose mission is to quote, create an environment in which every woman and girl [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  can exercise her human rights. When I saw the list of women's rights organizations who have said [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=253.84s)]
*  nothing, I nearly choked. Where is the solidarity for women in this country and in this world to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=260.88s)]
*  stand up for our mothers, our sisters and our daughters? Silence for two months after October [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=270.16s)]
*  7th from the National Organization for Women, the largest feminist activist organization in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=276.8s)]
*  the United States. And when they finally did muster out a statement, they didn't even mention Hamas. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=283.44000000000005s)]
*  Silence from the International Committee of the Red Cross, who is supposed to be an independent [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  and neutral organization to quote, ensure humanitarian protection and assistance for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=296.0s)]
*  victims of war and armed violence and to promote the laws that protect victims of war. Silence from [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=302.0s)]
*  almost every organization you would expect to care about these women and these hostages, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=310.0s)]
*  organizations who are chartered to actually do this work, to protect these hostages and to make [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=316.32s)]
*  a difference. Daily, many of these people in these groups call for a ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=322.64s)]
*  but they are silent about the hostages. Why do they cry for a ceasefire and not insist [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=328.96s)]
*  on freeing the hostages, the very thing that could actually end the war? There are 136 hostages [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  still being held by Hamas in Gaza right this moment. Some of those people are dead. Two of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=344.88s)]
*  them are babies. About 20 of them are young women. And it has been 100 days since they disappeared [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=352.24s)]
*  beneath the earth's surface in Gaza. In those 100 days, thanks to those hostages who have been [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  released and thanks to the intrepid work of journalists in Israel and across the world, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=369.12s)]
*  we have learned a great deal about what the feminists of the world are choosing largely to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=374.32s)]
*  ignore. They are ignoring hostages who have been seriously wounded, shot, or with dismembered limbs [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=379.6s)]
*  who are without medical care. They are ignoring hostages who don't have enough food and water. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=387.12s)]
*  They are ignoring hostages who are being beaten and tortured. They are ignoring hostages who have [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  been sitting for 100 days in the pits of hell. As if all of that wouldn't be bad enough. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=399.68s)]
*  But what they are also ignoring is the ongoing subjugation of those some 20 remaining women. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=407.44s)]
*  And that is not hyperbole or hysteria or speculation or claims made by politicians to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=414.72s)]
*  make a political point or advance the aims of the broader war. It is first-hand testimony [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=420.8s)]
*  that is coming out of the mouths of women who were there and who saw what was happening with [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=427.44s)]
*  their own eyes. One released hostage, 17-year-old Agam Goldstein Almag, told the Free Press that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=433.44s)]
*  about 50 days into her captivity, she met some of these young women in the tunnels, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=441.84s)]
*  some of whom still had bloody gunshot wounds that had been left untreated, and one of whom [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=448.0s)]
*  had a dismembered limb. They told Agam that they had been sexually abused. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=454.08s)]
*  Here is what Agam told us. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=459.04s)]
*  Almag, Agam's mother, who was held hostage with her daughter, told the New York Times that she, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=489.04s)]
*  too, met women in the tunnels who said they were sexually abused. In recounting a conversation she [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  had with these hostages, Chenn told Israeli media that Hamas, quote, simply put a gun to their heads [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=500.72s)]
*  and did what they wanted to them at gunpoint. 21-year-old Mia Shem, who was released after [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=507.68s)]
*  54 days in captivity, told Israeli media that before she was taken to Gaza, she was, quote, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=514.56s)]
*  groped on her upper body by her first kidnapper. It was only when he realized that her arm was [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  severed she said that he stopped. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=527.04s)]
*  When she got to Gaza, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=544.56s)]
*  she said she feared death and she feared rape. She said she thinks the only reason she wasn't [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=573.28s)]
*  raped in captivity is because her captor's wife and children were present in the home the whole [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=579.28s)]
*  time. Did he ever do something like that? No, only because his wife was outside the door. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=584.88s)]
*  If we were there alone, something was bound to happen. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=595.6s)]
*  Aviva Siegel, 64 years old, was held in Gaza for more than 50 days. Her husband is still in [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=598.4s)]
*  captivity. She testified before a Knesset committee that she witnessed a woman being tortured and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=607.04s)]
*  another who showed signs that her captor had violated her. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=614.16s)]
*  It's not just the released hostages giving these testimonies. One of the doctors who treated the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=628.4s)]
*  released hostages reported that 10 of the people who were freed, including men, were sexually [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=653.84s)]
*  abused in captivity. Another doctor said that among the 30 female hostages that he treated [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=660.48s)]
*  between the ages of 12 to 48, many suffered sexual assault during captivity. Another doctor said that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=666.64s)]
*  many of the released female hostages showed signs of PTSD and said that the patients are, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=675.44s)]
*  deeply traumatized by extremely serious sexual assaults. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=682.4s)]
*  None of this should come as a surprise because the entire world saw what Hamas did on October 7th [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=688.8s)]
*  above ground in broad daylight, proudly captured in their own photographs and videos [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  for the entire world to see. The extent of the rape and sexual violence by Hamas on October 7 [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  has been well documented in pictures, in videos, in eyewitness accounts, in testimony from rescue [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=712.16s)]
*  teams and medics, in testimony from pathologists and from people who prepared Jewish bodies for [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=719.92s)]
*  burial according to Jewish law. A New York Times investigation last month, the haunting must-read [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=726.4s)]
*  piece is called Screams Without Words, reported that medics found more than 30 bodies of women [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=734.24s)]
*  and girls with their clothes torn off and with signs of sexual abuse. They reviewed photographs [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=741.28s)]
*  of one woman's corpse with, quote, dozens of nails driven into her thighs and groin. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=748.0799999999999s)]
*  They also reviewed a video provided by the Israeli military, quote, showing two dead Israeli soldiers [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=754.64s)]
*  at a base near Gaza who appeared to have been shot directly in their vaginas. One witness, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  a 24-year-old woman named Sapir, who survived the Nova Festival on October 7th, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=767.6s)]
*  spoke to the Times about what she saw that day. And this next part is hard for me to read and it [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=773.28s)]
*  may be hard for you to listen to, but I think it's important for me to read it. Quote, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=778.96s)]
*  the first victim she said she saw was a young woman with copper-colored hair, blood running down [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=784.08s)]
*  her back, pants pushed down to her knees. One man pulled her by the hair and made her bend over. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=791.2s)]
*  Another penetrated her, Sapir said, and every time she flinched, he plunged a knife into her back. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=798.88s)]
*  She said she then watched another woman, quote, shredded into pieces. While one terrorist raped [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=805.76s)]
*  her, she said, another pulled out a box cutter and sliced off her breast. One continues to rape her [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=812.4000000000001s)]
*  and the other throws her breast to someone else and they play with it, throw it, and it falls on [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=820.48s)]
*  the ground. She said the men sliced her face and then the woman fell out of view. Around the same [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=826.32s)]
*  time, she said, she saw three other women raped and terrorists carrying the severed heads of three [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=834.48s)]
*  more women. Another witness at Nova, Roz Cohen, told the Times and later CNN of a gang raped he [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=840.72s)]

*  of the circle and after they pulled the clothes off of the girl, they started to, one of them started [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=859.92s)]
*  to, to rape her and it was something like a 30 seconds and after he raped her, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=873.04s)]
*  he take a knife and a killer, murderer, and after he did it, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=891.8399999999999s)]
*  he continued to rape the dead body. In countless IDF testimonies, soldiers and medics and volunteers [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=900.0s)]
*  have testified to what they found in the homes of the Kibbutzim near Gaza. One rescue officer [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=909.2s)]
*  testified that when he entered the home of one of the communities attacked, he found a 14 or 15-year-old [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=915.52s)]
*  girl who had been raped and then killed, shot in the head in her bedroom next to her sister. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=921.92s)]
*  I see two girls, 14, 15 years old teenager, her pants are pulled down, someone executed her right [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=928.4s)]
*  after he brutally, brutally raped her while just shooting her in the head. Some first responders [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=935.92s)]
*  testified that they couldn't even tell if the bodies they found were men or women. That's how badly [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=943.76s)]
*  these people were mutilated. I saw in front of my eyes a woman [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=951.04s)]
*  laying, she was naked, she had nails and different objects [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=957.36s)]
*  and her female organs. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=970.4s)]
*  Her body was brutal in a way that we could not identify her. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=971.52s)]
*  Others who worked for the military morgue testified that they saw, quote, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=982.16s)]
*  women with bloody underwear, with broken bones, broken legs, and broken pelvises. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=986.48s)]
*  As the Times investigation points out, the true number of women assaulted on October 7th will [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=992.64s)]
*  never be known. That's because some of the bodies were burned so badly that they weren't bodies in [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=998.32s)]
*  the end at all. It's also because Jewish religious ritual dictates that bodies be buried as quickly as [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1004.48s)]
*  possible, usually the day after death. Of course, there was the absolute chaos of the days following [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1011.12s)]
*  the attack when terrorists were still roaming free in southern Israel and where Israeli medics and [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1016.88s)]
*  volunteers were simply unable to keep up with the death toll and the destruction. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1022.24s)]
*  At the Nova Festival site, to choose just one example, bodies were hauled away by the truckload. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  More than 360 of them at that particular site. Now imagine right now if one of these 18 or 19 [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1033.6s)]
*  year olds being held by Hamas was your daughter. Imagine if the world, imagine if other mothers [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  and daughters and women did not scream on your behalf. That silence alone would be unimaginable. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1050.96s)]
*  But then imagine if some of them didn't just not speak up for you, but instead they berated you [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1059.8400000000001s)]
*  or suggested that your child somehow deserved it. That's exactly what happened to the mother of one [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1065.92s)]
*  teenage girl who currently remains in captivity. Last month in New York City, a group of anti-Israel [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1072.96s)]
*  protesters harassed Dr. Ayelet Levi-Shachar, the mother of a 19 year old girl, Nama, who was taken [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1079.76s)]
*  hostage on October 7th. Shame on you. They yelled at the grieving mother. Ayelet's 19 year old [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1087.84s)]
*  daughter, Nama Levi, was taken hostage by Hamas in a now infamous video. Her hands were bound, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1097.84s)]
*  her ankles were cut, her pants were soaked in blood, and she is stolen away by screaming [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1104.48s)]
*  terrorists with automatic weapons spirited away into the back of a black Jeep. Or take how the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1110.4s)]
*  Red Cross responded to the family of Doron Steinbrecher, a 30 year old woman being held [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1118.3200000000002s)]
*  by Hamas in Gaza without her medication. The family told Jake Tapper that when they begged the [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1123.92s)]
*  Red Cross for help, the Red Cross actually told the family, you should focus your concerns on [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1129.68s)]
*  Gazans. My mom had a few meets with the Red Cross and she told them, my sister need to [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1135.68s)]
*  get her medicine. Yeah. And they told her that we should care more about the Arab people on the [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  other side and less about our beloved ones. Or take just this week when a San Francisco man who [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1156.72s)]
*  lost five family members at Kibbutz Be'eri, including two who were kidnapped, shared his [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1166.56s)]
*  testimony at a city council meeting. He was met with boos and jeers and pig noises from anti-Israel [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1173.1200000000001s)]
*  activists. It fuels anti-Semitism and hatred as exemplified in this room right now. Listen, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1180.88s)]
*  the pig noises and everything else is pure anti-Semitism. And I have never, since I moved [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1187.44s)]
*  to San Francisco, seen this kind of hatred against the minority group ever. And again, just last week [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1192.8000000000002s)]
*  when an Israeli woman in New York City went over to a group of anti-Israel protesters and tried to [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1199.44s)]
*  talk to them, my friend is being held hostage by Hamas, she said. One of the female protesters [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1204.88s)]
*  responded, go cry at home, bitch. And then maybe worst of all, there are the women who are questioning [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1210.64s)]
*  or denying that any of this happened at all. Now it's important to note that there are also a lot [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1224.16s)]
*  of men denying the atrocities of October 7th and the ongoing atrocities. The Gray Zones, Max [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1230.0s)]
*  Blumenthal, the journalist Aaron Mate, the journalist Ali Aboumina, Owen Jones from The [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1236.16s)]
*  Guardian. But the thing I cannot wrap my head around is how a staggering number of these deniers [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1241.68s)]
*  and the people ripping down the posters of the hostages are women themselves. Women like Breonna [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1248.3200000000002s)]
*  Joy Gray, a political commentator at The Hill, host of the show Rising, and most notably Bernie [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1254.5600000000002s)]
*  Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign national press secretary. She also happens to have a law degree [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1260.64s)]
*  from Harvard. Over and over again, Gray has simply refused to accept that Hamas raped Israeli women. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1266.0s)]
*  Why? Because the quote Zionists, she says, were relying on men as witnesses. And because, as she [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1274.64s)]
*  put it, Israel didn't collect rape kits on October 7th. In case that seems hard to believe, here's the [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1281.44s)]
*  whole tweet for you. Zionists are asking that we believe the uncorroborated eyewitness account of [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1288.96s)]
*  men who describe alleged rape victims in odd, fetishistic terms. Shame on Israel for not [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1295.92s)]
*  seriously investigating claims of rape and collecting rape kits. Next, she added, it was [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  fishy that no female victims have offered their testimony. As the feminist Jill Filipovic put it [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1310.8000000000002s)]
*  perfectly, yes, it is generally the case that if you kill your victims, they can't testify against [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1318.3200000000002s)]
*  you. I'd add that it's hard to give testimony when you're held underground at gunpoint in a tunnel [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1324.24s)]
*  by a terrorist. More recently, in the face of overwhelming evidence, including the New York [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1331.84s)]
*  Times investigation, an investigation that did include female eyewitnesses, Gray argued that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1337.92s)]
*  she simply has skepticism that is rooted in the timing of what she calls the resurgence of these [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1343.52s)]
*  claims. And this is subjective. I'm not saying that I have any evidence of this, but it felt coordinated [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1349.12s)]
*  and out of nowhere and perhaps in response to clearly dwindling public support. If I hadn't told [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1354.7199999999998s)]
*  you that these words were coming out of the mouth of a former Bernie Sanders campaign secretary, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1361.6s)]
*  I'd venture to guess that you would have thought they were coming out of the mouth of someone like [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1367.12s)]
*  Alex Jones. This is a person, Gray is, who tweeted in 2018 about Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1370.6399999999999s)]
*  allegations that quote, the burden is on Kavanaugh to rebut it. I could go on about the hypocrisy of [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1378.16s)]
*  Brianna Joy Gray, but the thing is this isn't just an instance of a single morally blind person. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1385.44s)]
*  In November, Samantha Pearson, then director of a sexual assault center at Canada's Alberta [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1391.2s)]
*  University, denied that acts of rape had taken place on October 7th, calling them unverified [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1398.8000000000002s)]
*  accusations. Last week, when Democratic politician Matt Dorsey asked the San Francisco [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1405.6s)]
*  Board of Supervisors committee to include language of Hamas's mass sexual violence in a ceasefire [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1412.6399999999999s)]
*  resolution it had passed, he was met with shouts of liar from the crowd. And according to a two [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1419.28s)]
*  month investigation by the New York Times, quote, showing a pattern of rape, mutilation and extreme [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1425.6s)]
*  brutality against women. And quote. In another instance from last week, when a woman was confronted [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1431.12s)]
*  on the street and asked why was she tearing down the posters raising awareness of Hamas's use of [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1440.32s)]
*  rape as a weapon of war, she responded because they had been proven false. Excuse me, why did you [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1446.7199999999998s)]
*  just tear down signs of women who went through sexual assault in Israel? Yeah, because they've [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1452.8s)]
*  been proven false. They've been proven false? Yes. Now, perhaps you're listening to this right now [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1458.08s)]
*  and you wonder if Israel is prosecuting its war against Hamas in the right way. Perhaps you're [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1463.76s)]
*  listening to this and thinking too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Perhaps you're [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1469.52s)]
*  thinking Palestinians should have their own state. Or maybe you're thinking Israel has historically [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1475.12s)]
*  been unjust in its treatment of the Palestinians. Or maybe you're listening and thinking about a [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1480.72s)]
*  thousand other things, a thousand other things about Israeli policy or about Bibi or about [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1485.6s)]
*  settlements or about Hamas or about USAID or about fears of an ever growing war. All of those are [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1491.1999999999998s)]
*  fair positions. All of those are fair questions. All of those are things worthy of debate. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  But when you are asking things like why didn't they use rape kits on dead women raped and shot [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1505.52s)]
*  in the head by terrorists on October 7th, you sound a little bit like a 9-11 truther. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1512.32s)]
*  It was almost like they ignored it because they wanted it to happen. Oh, come on, Jesse. No, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1518.32s)]
*  not oh, come on. Every, wait a minute. Every war starts with a false flag operation. Or like a Sandy [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1523.6799999999998s)]
*  Hook denier. The official story of Sandy Hook has more holes in it than Swiss cheese. So don't ever [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1530.96s)]
*  think the globalists that have hijacked this country wouldn't stage something like this. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1538.64s)]
*  Or like why, why did Hitler want to guess the Jews? He didn't. The gas chamber they show you [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1542.72s)]

*  weeks now, where does all of this come from? There's no single answer. Perhaps it's politics, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1561.5200000000002s)]
*  the growing trend of young women and not young men moving leftward. And if you're on the hard left, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1567.92s)]
*  you've been immersed now for at least a decade in the belief that the world is divided plainly into [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1572.96s)]
*  the oppressor and the oppressed. And Israel is the ultimate oppressor. And likely everything in your [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1578.5600000000002s)]

*  back to you. Or perhaps it's fear. Fear of speaking out on issues that are perceived as [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1589.8400000000001s)]
*  controversial. Fear of being tarred as choosing sides. Fear of being tarred as choosing the wrong [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1595.1999999999998s)]
*  side. Or perhaps it's because facing the reality of this situation is actually too difficult to [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1601.76s)]
*  bear. Or perhaps it's because the victims in this case are Israelis and Jews. As my friend, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1608.08s)]
*  Batya Anger Sargon has noted, for years, certain people demanded we replace due process with believe [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1615.6s)]
*  all women. These same people, when presented with evidence of the mass rape of Israeli women, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1621.68s)]
*  now demand context. Believe all women became don't believe the confessions of rapists [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1628.4s)]
*  if they're victims or Jews. Whatever the reason, for anyone, especially for women, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1634.8s)]
*  to remain silent or to downplay or to deny such atrocities is an assault not just on the victims, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1642.24s)]
*  not just on their families, not just on Israelis, and not just on Jews. It is an assault on truth [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVXFXZ9xGA&t=1650.8s)]
