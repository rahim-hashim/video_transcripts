Trump’s inauguration is right around the corner, and there is so much to cover about the new White House. In the coming weeks, we’ll have key figures in the Trump administration on Honestly to talk about what they are planning.

But, we all know that if Trump 2.0 is anything like Trump 1.0, there are going to be a lot of twists and turns here. And we want to analyze and break down each development that unfolds in Trump’s new administration.
Starting today and for the next few months, we’re going to bring you weekly episodes with two of my favorite guests: Batya Ungar-Sargon and Brianna Wu.

Batya Ungar-Sargon is a Free Press contributor and the opinion editor at Newsweek. Brianna Wu is a Democratic fundraiser and activist, and in her past life, a video game developer. If you’ve heard them together on Honestly before, you know that these two come from different sides of the political spectrum, but we really value hearing both of their perspectives, even—or especially—when they disagree. We think you will too.

Today, we’re going to cover the L.A. fires and their political implications, the civil war inside the MAGA movement between the nationalist populists and the free marketers over H-1B visas, and Mark Zuckerberg’s red pill moment and changes at Meta—and the pair give us their predictions for confirmation hearings beginning this week.

# WATCH: LA Fires, MAGA's Schism, and Meta's Big Pivot
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's inauguration is right around the corner and there is so much to cover in this new White House. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=4.0s)]
*  In the coming weeks, we're going to have key figures from the new Trump administration on to talk about what they're planning and what you can expect. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=9.0s)]
*  But we all know that if Trump 2.0 is anything like Trump 1.0, there's going to be a lot to cover, a lot of twists, a lot of turns and certainly controversy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=16.0s)]
*  And we wanted to make the space to analyze and break down each development as it unfolds. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=25.0s)]
*  Starting today and for the next few months, we're going to bring you weekly panels to break down the politics with some of our favorite guests so you can stay informed about what's happening in Trump's new White House. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=30.0s)]
*  For today, those two people are Batya Ungar Sargon and Brianna Wu. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=41.0s)]
*  Batya Ungar Sargon is a Free Press contributor and the opinion editor at Newsweek. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=46.0s)]
*  She is also the author of the essential book Second Class. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=50.0s)]
*  Brianna Wu is a Democratic fundraiser and activist and in her past life a video game developer. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=54.0s)]
*  If you've heard them on Honestly Together before, you know that these two come from different sides of the political spectrum. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=60.0s)]
*  I don't even know if there's a spectrum anymore, just different places on the political map. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=66.0s)]
*  But I value both of their perspectives, even or especially when they disagree. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=70.0s)]
*  And I know you will too. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=74.0s)]
*  Today, we talk about the LA fires that have that city burning and their political implications, not just for Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom, but for the Democratic Party. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=76.0s)]
*  We talk about the Civil War inside the MAGA movement between nationalist populists like Steve Bannon and free marketeers like Elon Musk. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=86.0s)]
*  We talk about Mark Zuckerberg's red pill moment and the changes he's making at Metta. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=94.0s)]
*  And then we end on some predictions for the confirmation hearings that begin this week in Washington. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=99.0s)]
*  Batya and Brianna, welcome to Honestly. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=110.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=112.0s)]
*  Thank you. This is such an honor. I'm so excited to get to know Batya better in YouTube area. This is going to be great. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=114.0s)]
*  Okay, brunettes. Let's try. Let's dive in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=120.0s)]
*  Before we get to the incoming administration, we need to cover a story that I really didn't expect us to be covering, although maybe the people that pay close attention to nature and reign and incompetency in California governance would not be so surprised. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=124.0s)]
*  And of course, I'm talking here about the California fires, since that is the thing on mine and I'm sure yours and everyone's mind. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=140.0s)]
*  These are the most destructive fires in Los Angeles's history. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=146.0s)]
*  As we record, 24 people have died. That number is sure to go up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=151.0s)]
*  More than 12,000 homes, businesses and buildings have been damaged or destroyed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=155.0s)]
*  There are whole parts of Los Angeles that seem like a nuclear bomb has been set off. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=160.0s)]
*  And lots of people are pointing lots of fingers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=165.0s)]
*  And I wanted to start by just asking, who's to blame here? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=168.0s)]
*  And Batya, I thought maybe we could start with you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're seeing people on the left kind of blaming the climate change issue and people on the right blaming DEI or incompetence. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=175.0s)]
*  I feel pretty grossed out by both of these trends. I think Leighton Woodhouse really nailed it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=184.0s)]
*  In a piece he wrote for Newsweek and also in the Free Press, where he argued that there's just something about the geology of this place that lends itself to these horrific acts of God every half a century, that the land there, you know, around the Santa Monica beach, Pacific Palisades should never have been developed because it was always going to erupt in flames in this way due to, you know, the fact that the vegetation is so large. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=191.0s)]
*  You know, the fact that the vegetation grows really lush during the rainy winter months and then dries out and the Santa Ana winds show up in the dry summer months. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=220.0s)]
*  And so to me, I found that really compelling. I just think it is so hard to imagine, you know, somebody doing a better job with so much destruction. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=230.0s)]
*  I don't have any confidence in Karen Bass or Gavin Newsom. I don't think that they're stars or particularly competent people. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=241.0s)]
*  But at the same time, nobody's pointing to things that are legitimate as, you know, actual mistakes that would have actually prevented this or helped the situation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=248.0s)]
*  From what I've been able to gather, and you know, your listeners should tell me if I'm wrong about this, but it seems like the reason there was no water in the hydrants was not because there is an absence of water for this kind of thing, but because the water pressure was simply failed because they were trying to get all of the water in the city into one place, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=257.0s)]
*  which is something that is very predictable, but I don't know how you fix for it. So to me, I feel like the politicization of this has been extremely disappointing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=277.0s)]
*  But I do think that on the ground, there's been a lot of unity and a lot of coming together, a lot of really moving moments on social media. So I'm trying to focus on those. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=286.0s)]
*  I'll say here that the piece that you referenced by Leighton Woodhouse has elicited more anger from very thoughtful people than perhaps any story we've run in the past few months. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=294.0s)]
*  I want to just read part of a letter that we're going to run tomorrow because I think it'll take us a little deeper into this conversation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=306.0s)]
*  Leighton Woodhouse's piece is a revolting example of the defeatism that permeates far too much of civil society today. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=311.0s)]
*  It's the same philosophy animating low birth rates, climate inevitability and racial determinism. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=318.0s)]
*  Take into its logical conclusion, Woodhouse's argument is that because Earth is part of a solar system that faces black holes, asteroids and an eventual implosion on the sun, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=323.0s)]
*  we should merely hang our heads and mutter goodbye to our lineage as the natural process of destruction takes place. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=334.0s)]
*  In other words, there's a kind of determinism and defeatism in the argument that, well, Los Angeles is built to burn. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=340.0s)]
*  In other words, you could say the same thing. Manhattan is built to flood. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=347.0s)]
*  We're surrounded by water. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=350.0s)]
*  The entire idea of building cities and civilization is the idea that we push back against nature. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=352.0s)]
*  So maybe I'm getting too heady for before noon on a Monday. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=359.0s)]
*  But I got to say, having lived in L.A. over the past four years, having seen the way that the basic compact between citizens and the government does not work, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=364.0s)]
*  you cannot, if you call the LAPD because there you see a robbery or in my case, see a man wildly swinging a machete, it might take them an hour to show up. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=377.0s)]
*  You know, living in New York, New York feels like this utopian paradise in terms of just functionality compared to Los Angeles. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=386.0s)]
*  So those fires are taking place in that political context, one in which things that should be public are increasingly privatized and in which people have really lost faith in the mayor and in the governor. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=393.0s)]
*  But I've gone on too long. I'm meant to be the host. Brianna, what do you think? Who's to blame? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=405.0s)]
*  I think it's so interesting because I think, Vatia, you're being a little bit more generous on the Democrats than I would be. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=409.0s)]
*  And this is what I would say. When I ran for Congress here in Massachusetts, I got a front row seat to what happens with one party governance. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=417.0s)]
*  And I think this is it really opened my eyes for a lot of things because Massachusetts, I think, is a great place to live. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=426.0s)]
*  But when it comes to some of our congenital problems that we just don't seem able to solve, like housing or public transportation, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=434.0s)]
*  the problem is the political system because Democrats are the only ones that win functionally. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=442.0s)]
*  It's all set up to reward field to power. And I think L.A. is this problem on steroids as well as I can as best as I can tell. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=447.0s)]
*  I actually flew out of L.A. the day that the fire started. I was out there. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=457.0s)]
*  And before it, I had a tweet that went viral just talking about how difficult it was to see the city degrade over the last 15 years. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=464.0s)]
*  I've been visiting there like homelessness is through the roof. I saw people shooting up drugs on the street. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=472.0s)]
*  Like it was really, really surprising to me. So, you know, I think you're dead on that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=478.0s)]
*  I agree with the free press piece when you're saying the core problem is ecological. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=484.0s)]
*  But that piece also tells stories about people not getting alerts on their phone when, you know, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=489.0s)]
*  we get an alert every time a senior citizen goes missing. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=495.0s)]
*  So no matter what, I think there is a crisis of confidence in our elected leaders and there's the trust has been broken that they're on our side. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=498.0s)]
*  And I think that goes for Democrats, particularly. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=509.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the political implications of this, not politicizing the fires themselves, but the implications. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=512.0s)]
*  Trump tweeted one of the best and most beautiful parts of the United States of America, and I can attest to that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=518.0s)]
*  It's really paradise is burning down to the ground. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=523.0s)]
*  It's ashes and Gavin Newsom should resign. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=526.0s)]
*  This is all his fault. Two weeks from now, Karen Bass, will she be in or out? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=530.0s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, what's his fate? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=536.0s)]
*  He's long wanted to run for presidents for the presidency. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=538.0s)]
*  Are those dreams over because of this fire? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=542.0s)]
*  That was my first thought is this is the end of his political career. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=544.0s)]
*  I don't see how he survives this. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=549.0s)]
*  And that sounds like a contradiction with what I open with, but I don't think it is. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=550.0s)]
*  It could be that something is just so devastating that your inability to respond to it in a way that's compelling ends your political career, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=554.0s)]
*  even though there would have been very little you could have done. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=561.0s)]
*  Obviously, like if Governor DeSantis had been in charge of L.A., [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=564.0s)]
*  I think people would have felt like there was more competence going on around them because I agree, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=568.0s)]
*  of course, with both of you that the contract in California has been broken and that there's a huge crisis and trust in public institutions. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=573.0s)]
*  I just think that this was an act of God and was so devastating for these ecological reasons that it seems sort of almost unfair. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=580.0s)]
*  You know, the the Karen Bass being in Ghana, that was an unforced error that led to this perception that the people in charge were not worthy of the trust of the public. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=590.0s)]
*  And they have earned that in a million different ways. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=601.0s)]
*  I just don't think that I certainly through all of my research have not been able to come up with a better plan for how they could have handled this. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=604.0s)]
*  But it may sink their careers. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=612.0s)]
*  I think that that's very likely. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=614.0s)]
*  Here's one of the lessons I'll put my cards on the table that I draw from this. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=616.0s)]
*  Government in L.A. and in many blue cities across the country has lost sight of the most basic parts of their job, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=621.0s)]
*  which is keeping people safe, safe from crime, safe from, you know, majorly drug addicted people harassing them on the street, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=628.0s)]
*  safe in this case from natural disasters like wildfires or if not safe, at least prepared. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=636.0s)]
*  And instead they have focused on, you know, what what Rob Henderson might call luxury issues or niche boutique issues that have very little to do with the basics of governing. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=641.0s)]
*  Is that going to be one of the kind of political takeaways from this? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=653.0s)]
*  I want to say something really quickly because I really want to hear what Brian has to say about that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=656.0s)]
*  Twenty people have died, I believe. Is that correct? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=661.0s)]
*  Twenty four so far, but it's definitely going to go up. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=664.0s)]
*  Twenty four people so far have died and we mourn every single one of them. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=666.0s)]
*  Horrific tragedy. Most of them were seniors and disabled people who couldn't get out. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=669.0s)]
*  It's horrifying when you look at the scope of the damage, people were informed. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=674.0s)]
*  People got out. I mean, I would if you had asked me looking at that landscape, that apocalyptic post apocalyptic burnt out landscape, how many people I would have thought would have died. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=681.0s)]
*  And again, God forbid I'm not minimizing these horrific deaths. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=693.0s)]
*  I would have expected it to be in the hundreds, if not the thousands. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=697.0s)]
*  So I do think that there's a point of view and we're talking about when you think about the neighborhoods like the Pacific Palisades. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=701.0s)]
*  I mean, I've been reading a lot about this. A lot of these towns are built. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=707.0s)]
*  There's one road going into an area where twenty five hundred people live. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=710.0s)]
*  The cars they had to flee their cars and survived fleeing their cars because the trees on either side of the road were engulfed in flames. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=714.0s)]
*  So really miraculous survival of many, many people. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=723.0s)]
*  And again, God forbid not to undermine the deaths, but it does seem like people's lives were very much saved. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=728.0s)]
*  There was a lot of property damage. And of course, that's terrible. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=735.0s)]
*  But I just wanted to make that point. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=738.0s)]
*  So where does your calculation come in that Gavin Newsom is going to have long term damage from this? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=741.0s)]
*  Because I think if we've seen anything over like political history, like I think all of us have learned that the American people tend to have short memories. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=747.0s)]
*  Right. So like, what would how do you get from A to B? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=755.0s)]
*  How do you think this is going to end? Look, cards on the table. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=758.0s)]
*  I'm friends with multiple people that I'm sure are going to run for president, you know, in twenty twenty eight. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=761.0s)]
*  We've had a lot of conversations about Gavin Newsom and the risk, you know, what his vulnerabilities are. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=767.0s)]
*  And I do think that there's an opening here. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=773.0s)]
*  But I'm curious, like, from your perspective, how do you get from A to B? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=775.0s)]
*  We're in twenty twenty eight after four years of Trump. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=779.0s)]
*  He's not going to be competitive when he's one of the very best communicators that we have. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=782.0s)]
*  Because I think a lot of the donor base that would have support supported him are now homeless. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=786.0s)]
*  You know, like you, you can either sort of, you know, really upset the middle class of the Democratic Party, you know, or you can upset the sort of rich donor class. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=792.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of the people who would have been that support against the bulwark of the sort of middle class and working class neighborhoods that went up in flame are now homeless and uninsured for their twenty, thirty million dollar homes. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=802.0s)]
*  And I don't think that they are going to forgive him for this, even if it's not necessarily his fault, especially when you're going to have such a crowded field of so many people who who are not associated with being on TV at the time that their homes were burning. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=815.0s)]
*  I could also make the argument, though, from from the, you know, sure, there's the wealthy donor class perspective on it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=827.0s)]
*  But there's also, you know, Altadena, this is not Malibu. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=833.0s)]
*  This is not the palisades. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=837.0s)]
*  Like these are middle like solidly middle class people. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=838.0s)]
*  And if I'm them and if I if my home is just burned to the ground. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=843.0s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, I'm thinking about this guy who went to the French laundry or whatever it was in the middle of covid. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=846.0s)]
*  Someone can fact check me on that. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=851.0s)]
*  But I think memory serves. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=853.0s)]
*  That was right. Yeah. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=854.0s)]
*  Like, why am I voting for the person, you know, that that is so out of touch with with my everyday concerns, just as an example, though, of like. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=855.0s)]
*  I've sort of been there's been a lot that we've published in a lot of commentary, I think, over the past since since the election November on the vibe shift, right? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=865.0s)]
*  Culturally and politically and, you know, the the woke is fading. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=874.0s)]
*  People are moving to the right. You guys know this conversation. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=880.0s)]
*  One piece of evidence just of how quickly things can shift is Maria Shriver, hardly a Republican conservative, is on Twitter talking about how Los Angeles and California needs radical change in the wake of this. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=883.0s)]
*  I have friends in L.A. Progressives texting me. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=899.0s)]
*  I guess I'm a Republican now. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=902.0s)]
*  In other words, they are so fed up. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=904.0s)]
*  It's not that they're Republican on on any particular policy issue. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=906.0s)]
*  It's that they are so disgusted, Brianna, with, you know, one party rule and the corruption of it that they're just like done. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=911.0s)]
*  I'll vote for anything else. That's not this. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=919.0s)]
*  Do you see that happening? Yeah, I think that really brings me into I hope as we do this, like this is a point I really want to hammer. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=922.0s)]
*  So I don't know. Like we all remember why to K. Y2K was a problem with technical debt. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=930.0s)]
*  We made some decisions in the 80s and 90s and we had to pay for it when the millennium came because our computers were going to crash. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=935.0s)]
*  There's a term for this is called technical debt. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=944.0s)]
*  The Democratic Party has serious silliness debt built up and the silliness debt is focusing even for me as a trans woman on trans policy and pronouns and a whole bunch of like there was a clip that went viral with someone like, you know, doing sign language in front of a press conference from this, even though teleprompters are built in. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=946.0s)]
*  We focus so much on these superficial, silly issues that do not make working class people's lives better. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=969.0s)]
*  And this is what Bateh, you've focused on like laser in your analysis. Is dad right about that? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=978.0s)]
*  So Barry, this is my analysis. When Trump won, it was really heartened because the conversations I was having with Democratic insiders were very much how do we get back in touch with working class people? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=983.0s)]
*  How do we put some of these silly issues aside? How do we get back to basics again? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=996.0s)]
*  And what is really terrifying me is today as we're recording this, I'm already seeing it just get back to the same playbook, which is anti Trump, deny everything, just point out that he's bad. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1001.0s)]
*  This is a losing playbook for us. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1013.0s)]
*  So I think how can this be? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1016.0s)]
*  How can how can this possibly I'm sure there's a way. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1018.0s)]
*  How can this possibly be yoked to Trump? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1021.0s)]
*  This? No, you can't. It's impossible. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1024.0s)]
*  But what I'm saying is like, look at what happened Gavin Newsom, right? He had a tattatat on Twitter with Trump. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1027.0s)]
*  It was the silliness on that. You know, you don't even believe in climate change. Does this help anyone get their house back? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1033.0s)]
*  You know, what people are going to find in L.A. as they are trying to rebuild is running into the residential zoning permit issue. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1039.0s)]
*  This is going to make people so mad at their local government. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1047.0s)]
*  And it's like either the Democratic Party can wake up and understand that people like us less than they like Trump, which is honestly scary. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1050.0s)]
*  And we can change and we can get back to basics. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1062.0s)]
*  And I think California is a real opportunity to do that. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1064.0s)]
*  So my assessment is if we wake up, if we handle this crisis well, this can be a moment that it's a new Democratic Party working together or we can go back to the same old way of doing business, which is fealty to power and politicians thinking about their next election. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1068.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think the latter is more likely. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1085.0s)]
*  One last question on this, and then I want to move on to another topic that's been engulfing the conversation in a different way. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1088.0s)]
*  I've been thinking a lot about the fact that the paradox goes like this. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1095.0s)]
*  We live in a world in which private companies and very determined individuals are able to create rocket ships that return to Earth and are caught by giant chopsticks. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1100.0s)]
*  OK, there's people talking legitimately. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1113.0s)]
*  And I didn't used to believe this about colonizing Mars. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1116.0s)]
*  Like that seems within the realm of possibility in our lifetime. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1119.0s)]
*  But at the same moment that that kind of technological progress is possible, one of the greatest states in the Union, a state that is the fifth largest economy in the world, is not able to contain a fire. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1122.0s)]
*  Like how does this is not a political question, I guess so much as a cultural one. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1140.0s)]
*  But what is it? What does that mean? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1146.0s)]
*  You know, is that a failure of priorities or is it that everyone that's smart and competent runs as far away as possible from government? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1149.0s)]
*  Like, and if so, how do we change that? I've just been thinking about that a lot. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1156.0s)]
*  It's like we live in an era of Starlink and SpaceX and choose your other thing. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1160.0s)]
*  And also we live in an era in which I saw this unbelievably emblematic photo in which a person in L.A. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1164.0s)]
*  was trying to put out a fire in his backyard with cartons of oat milk because there was presumably no water in the hose. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1169.0s)]
*  That's unbelievable. What explains that? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1176.0s)]
*  I mean, how much of both of you worked with like elected officials up close? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1179.0s)]
*  Like, I want to be really honest, like, I cannot think of how many projects over the years. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1183.0s)]
*  Like, as someone who comes from the tech industry, like, I have a background in being able to do like regression analysis on large data sets, right, which is a helpful thing to do. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1188.0s)]
*  And I can't tell you how many times I have worked with people that I really loved and respected. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1197.0s)]
*  But you see them up close and you try to get real life stuff done. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1206.0s)]
*  It's just a soul crushing experience constantly. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1210.0s)]
*  Like, maybe my experience is just bad. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1213.0s)]
*  Maybe I've just tried to work with the wrong people. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1216.0s)]
*  But it feels it feels like I see stories about America like planning to go to the moon. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1219.0s)]
*  And yeah, there was politics. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1226.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you had people that were empowered to make decisions to get us there. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1228.0s)]
*  Right. You know, the people in NASA were working together. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1232.0s)]
*  It just feels from my experience like it's it's so hard for people with good intentions to go into government or partner with the government to get things done today. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1236.0s)]
*  It feels like it's instantly about optics and elections and positioning yourself. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1247.0s)]
*  I just I wonder if with social media and in this age where we're so focused on how we look like this, this bread and butter problem solving ability is just so hard. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1253.0s)]
*  It is something that is vanishing from the American governmental sector. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1266.0s)]
*  So is Doge the solution? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1270.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1273.0s)]
*  I think it might be. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1275.0s)]
*  Let's before we get to Doge, let's talk about a little thing called H1B. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1276.0s)]
*  OK. And if you're not a person that lives on the Internet, you might not even know what that is. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1282.0s)]
*  So let me explain. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1287.0s)]
*  The thing that everyone has been talking about for the last week or two is immigration, particularly the H1B controversy. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1288.0s)]
*  And for those who have never heard of what that is, H1B visas go to highly skilled workers, think doctors, lawyers, engineers, coders. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1297.0s)]
*  It's sold as a program of visas, temporary visas for the best and brightest. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1305.0s)]
*  And it's been around since about 1990. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1309.0s)]
*  Now, typically the immigration debate in this country centers around low wage working, low excuse me, low wage workers and illegal immigration. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1311.0s)]
*  But this controversy over H1Bs has turned out to be one of the early and profound fissures between the two wings of the new Trumpist Republican Party. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1320.0s)]
*  The sort of forgive me for being crude, the free market business types think of Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and the true nationalist populists think people like Steve Bannon. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1331.0s)]
*  The must types have come out in ferocious defense of the H1B visa program. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1344.0s)]
*  Perhaps not surprising, given that of the eighty five thousand H1B visas that were granted that are granted each year, about 70 percent of them work in tech. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1348.0s)]
*  And then on the other side, we have a very strange coalition, maybe not so strange to Batya, people like Steve Bannon, but also Bernie Sanders. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1357.0s)]
*  So, Batya, you were big on this issue. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1365.0s)]
*  I saw you all over TV talking about it. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1369.0s)]
*  Explain to us where you stand and why you stand there. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1372.0s)]
*  When I was reporting my book, Second Class and traveling around the country interviewing working class people, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1376.0s)]
*  their top two policy agenda items were they wanted much less immigration, legal and illegal, and much more access to high quality, affordable health care. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1382.0s)]
*  And I'm going to say it again. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1394.0s)]
*  I've said it before. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1396.0s)]
*  The first party to arrive at that combination of much fewer immigrants, much more affordable health care is going to have a ruling majority for 40 years. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1397.0s)]
*  They don't distinguish between legal and illegal immigration because what people living on a shoestring budget understand is that labor is like everything else. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1408.0s)]
*  It adheres to the ironclad law of supply and demand. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1417.0s)]
*  The more you have of it, the cheaper it is. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1420.0s)]
*  The less you have of it, the dearer it is. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1423.0s)]
*  Now, as a leftist, it was my understanding that what we were trying to do was get higher wages for the working class. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1426.0s)]
*  It turns out the Democratic Party didn't agree with me. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1433.0s)]
*  They thought that the point was raise taxes on the rich, take all that money and treat the working class like the poor and give them stuff. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1435.0s)]
*  And honestly, working class people, that does not appeal to them. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1442.0s)]
*  But they see competition in working class jobs that don't require a degree coming across the border in the form of 11 million illegal immigrants who are all going to be working in five or six or seven industries, resulting in just collapsing wages in those industries. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1445.0s)]
*  By the way, people will say those are jobs Americans don't want. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1461.0s)]
*  It's absolute nonsense. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1464.0s)]
*  There is not a single industry in America that has done a majority by immigrants, legal or illegal, meaning that a majority of every single job is done by native born Americans. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1466.0s)]
*  Now, just let's for a minute imagine how that makes them feel to be told by billionaires. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1477.0s)]
*  This job is beneath the dignity of an American. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1483.0s)]
*  So I'm going to bring somebody in from Venezuela to do it. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1486.0s)]
*  So let's set that aside. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1489.0s)]
*  What launched the whole debate was over the Christmas holiday. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1490.0s)]
*  I don't understand why these people weren't with their families, but they weren't. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1494.0s)]
*  They were on Twitter. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1497.0s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy wrote a long Twitter thread about how American culture is producing lazy and stupid and mediocre people because Americans are culturally addicted to mediocrity. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1498.0s)]
*  And Elon Musk joined in, retweeted somebody calling American workers retards, and then literally told people to go F themselves in the face because he's going to die on the hill of expanding the H1B program. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1510.0s)]
*  And the reason people like me have a problem with that program is, is, you know, back in the early 2000s when they shipped five million good middle class jobs overseas to China and Mexico to build up their middle class, they told people to learn how to code. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1524.0s)]
*  But now it turns out actually they're going to be importing people to do those coding jobs. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1538.0s)]
*  So yes, eighty five thousand H1B visas a year. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1543.0s)]
*  There's about half a million, three quarters of a million people who are on H1B visas. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1546.0s)]
*  Seventy five percent of tech engineers working in Silicon Valley today are foreign born. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1551.0s)]
*  These are great middle class jobs when they're done by Americans. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1555.0s)]
*  But when you import people to do them from India, they do them for about forty thousand dollars a year cheaper. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1559.0s)]
*  And what that means is it drives down the wages across that industry. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1565.0s)]
*  So our best and brightest are not now even going into that industry at all. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1569.0s)]
*  So people will say, oh, you know, we're bringing in the best and the brightest. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1574.0s)]
*  This is a brain drain from the rest of the world. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1578.0s)]
*  It's nonsense. I mean, half a million people is not the best and the brightest. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1580.0s)]
*  Thirty percent of people working in STEM are foreign born. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1584.0s)]
*  So again, we're talking about just we're importing a cast of indentured servants who are allowed to enter the country, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1588.0s)]
*  but they have to stay with that employer, which again reduces their wages by another 25 percent. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1595.0s)]
*  This is the opposite of everything Trump campaigned on, ran on and won on. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1600.0s)]
*  And it's a huge betrayal of his base. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1606.0s)]
*  And I'm really hoping that at some point, you know, Steve Bannon wins this fight and Elon is kicked to the curb before, you know, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1609.0s)]
*  before Trump becomes president, because if he really is about to now betray his entire base over this immigration issue, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1615.0s)]
*  which is the number one issue as far as they're concerned, you know, it's not going to go very well for the administration. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1621.0s)]
*  OK, I want to I want to get deeper into the politics. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1627.0s)]
*  Brianna, before we move on, you're someone who actually has worked deeply in the tech industry, presumably with a lot of people on H-1B visas. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1629.0s)]
*  Are they indentured servants, as Batia said? What's the what's the dynamic? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1637.0s)]
*  You can certainly be at a company and be here on a visa and have a very difficult time leaving. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1641.0s)]
*  That's 100 percent true. You know, and I find that I'm like halfway in agreement with you and I'm halfway not. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1646.0s)]
*  So I'm with you because I've seen soft I've seen companies abuse the system to not pay software engineers what we're worth. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1654.0s)]
*  I've seen that over and over and over again. But I live here in Boston. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1662.0s)]
*  We have two tech. We have two sectors in Boston. It's tech and biotech. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1666.0s)]
*  My husband works in biotech. I work in tech. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1670.0s)]
*  And I can tell you they bring in experts with this system that have experts in like molecular biology or subspecialties. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1673.0s)]
*  And we just do need a system to bring them here. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1682.0s)]
*  Like if you look at the corona the coronavirus vaccine, this is an excellent example of this. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1685.0s)]
*  Or if you look at the tech sector, you know, we are not training enough people with really deep understanding of A.I., ML, DL, you know, these different ideas. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1691.0s)]
*  We really do need to be able to bring in the very best people in the entire world to do this. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1702.0s)]
*  So if you want like medium, I agree with you. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1708.0s)]
*  The system has been broken. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1711.0s)]
*  But I think if you're talking about shutting it down or like shrinking it entirely, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1713.0s)]
*  I think that what you're going to end up doing is seeing the economy shrink because when those people can't work in America, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1718.0s)]
*  that is going to create a vacuum and all these other countries are trying to create their own Silicon Valley. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1724.0s)]
*  That talent is going to go there and we're going to be competing against them. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1729.0s)]
*  So I think there is a way to split the difference here and address that very legitimate case that you made. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1733.0s)]
*  And I think what that looks like is the higher the pay, the first you go into the visa system, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1740.0s)]
*  like it's a lottery system and the more they're getting paid, the more it is there. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1746.0s)]
*  And that really would make it so these very rare talents that we cannot get in the United States or we need more expertise on like drone technology, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1750.0s)]
*  we can bring them in here. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1759.0s)]
*  But if you're talking about completely shutting it down, I think I understand your argument. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1761.0s)]
*  I think you do not understand how much it would cripple the tech sector in the United States and biotech. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1766.0s)]
*  We actually have a visa for people who are uniquely talented. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1771.0s)]
*  We have the zero one visa for exceptional aliens. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1775.0s)]
*  So we actually have a separate visa for people who are bringing a talent that you cannot get here. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1778.0s)]
*  What makes me so enraged is that these H1Bs are more often than not given to people who are totally mediocre. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1783.0s)]
*  They come from less good schools than Americans in the tech sector. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1790.0s)]
*  They get not as good grades. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1794.0s)]
*  In fact, American tech STEM graduates routinely rank higher than people from China, Russia and India. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1796.0s)]
*  So they are mediocre compared to our homegrown talent. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1805.0s)]
*  Plus, why are we not going into the inner city and Appalachia and teaching our people how to do those jobs? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1808.0s)]
*  Like people will say, oh, let's let's just pay people more. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1815.0s)]
*  We'll tie the visa to the highest paying thing. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1818.0s)]
*  Do you know how much angry I'm going to be when they do that? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1821.0s)]
*  Like that's going to be their solution is going to be let's pay these immigrants even more. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1823.0s)]
*  And then I'm going to be even angrier. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1828.0s)]
*  Like instead of paying an American $90,000 a year, you're now going to be paying, you know, half a million Indians that. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1830.0s)]
*  And it's I have nothing against them. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1836.0s)]
*  I'm a quarter Indian myself, you know, but I just the idea that we do not owe anything to our neighbors while we get rich is disgusting to me. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1838.0s)]
*  And that is the ideology that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are bringing into the administration through Doge. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1848.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I think that that Doge is just a it's a cover for the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1855.0s)]
*  Whoa, yes. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1860.0s)]
*  Every one. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1863.0s)]
*  Let me explain. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1864.0s)]
*  I will I will make the case and then you can tell me why you think this is not true. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1865.0s)]
*  I mean, basically, let's look at what it is accomplished so far. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1869.0s)]
*  OK, the first accomplishment of Elon Musk has been to take a spending bill and the top beneficiary of that action was China because there were limits in the first bill on investments in China that were taken out of the second bill. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1873.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking to myself when Elon Musk was jumping up and down on stage next to Trump. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1889.0s)]
*  It's so interesting that Elon Musk, whose entire supply chain is in China, who built a showroom for Tesla in the Xinjiang region of China where the Uighurs are being genocided, that he is being given the green light by Xi Jinping to try to help Donald Trump win because of course Xi Jinping would rather the Democrats win when they're much softer on China than Donald Trump is. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1893.0s)]
*  But look how much China has already gotten for bang for its buck. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1916.0s)]
*  And Trump's not even in office yet. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1920.0s)]
*  They've got somebody who is who has never said a negative word about China. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1922.0s)]
*  I mean, never. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1926.0s)]
*  Now is number two to the throne. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1928.0s)]
*  But hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1931.0s)]
*  I think that there's a really interesting and hopefully we'll assign it very deep story to be written on Elon and China and his interest there. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1932.0s)]
*  No question. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1940.0s)]
*  But I completely fail to see how this isn't just a really, really simple debate and a sincere one between those who believe, as you do, and as Steve Bannon does in a kind of economic populist worldview, and those who believe, like Elon and Vivek and perhaps Brianna and probably me, that you can make a very potent America First argument by saying, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1941.0s)]
*  Look, in order for us to stay ahead of all of these other countries that we are kind of at, you know, in a new Cold War with on AI on quantum computing on chips on biotech, we have to be fast. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1969.0s)]
*  We have to be cheap and we have to be ahead and that we need to win. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1983.0s)]
*  We need to beat China. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1987.0s)]
*  And the way to do that is to get the best and the brightest around the world. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1989.0s)]
*  It's not to say we shouldn't train people in Appalachia or anything else. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1994.0s)]
*  But the way to do that is to is to get them like how is how is it not as that's how I see it. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=1997.0s)]
*  I see it as an argument between those that have generally a free market worldview and those that don't. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2003.0s)]
*  Right. So two things. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2009.0s)]
*  The first is, we are not winning if our neighbors are poor, like that it's not winning when our GDP goes up and it 90% of that goes into Elon Musk's pocket. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2010.0s)]
*  That is not what winning looks like. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2020.0s)]
*  Winning is when you have a middle class that is stable, children that are upwardly mobile, who are living in safe neighborhoods whose parents know where their retirement is coming from. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2021.0s)]
*  You know, like that's what winning looks like. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2032.0s)]
*  It's not just a GDP number is not winning. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2034.0s)]
*  But also all of these supposed best and brightest are literally being trained here in the US. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2037.0s)]
*  Like they're they're coming here. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2043.0s)]
*  They're paying, you know, sticker ticket prices for our universities. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2044.0s)]
*  And that is how they get fed into the sector. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2049.0s)]
*  They have no like this is not like a special talent pool of unique talent. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2052.0s)]
*  These are people who are getting an education that should be going to Americans who are not getting this education because they don't have those opportunities. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2057.0s)]
*  They don't have access to them. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2065.0s)]
*  They're not going to pay the sticker ticket. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2066.0s)]
*  Like people are getting rich off. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2068.0s)]
*  This is not what winning looks like as a nation. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2070.0s)]
*  We owe something to our neighbors. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2073.0s)]
*  We can't keep lining our pockets with the proceeds of an economy that is an upward transfer of wealth. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2075.0s)]
*  So let me give you a very specific example. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2082.0s)]
*  See if I can change your mind here that I may not be able to. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2084.0s)]
*  OK, so Boston Dynamics. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2088.0s)]
*  We've all seen the videos online of the Terminator robots, right? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2089.0s)]
*  Little dogs walking around Boston Dynamics. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2093.0s)]
*  Like it's great. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2095.0s)]
*  It's great. It's right around the corner for me. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2096.0s)]
*  I was touring it the other day. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2098.0s)]
*  So here's a really honest question, right? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2100.0s)]
*  Drones are such a critical part of warfare today. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2102.0s)]
*  They have been hugely instrumental in the Russian-Ukraine War. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2106.0s)]
*  But all of these drones are generally manufactured in China. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2110.0s)]
*  So why does this Boston Dynamics robot, the dog robot? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2114.0s)]
*  I think it's like thirty thousand dollars, something like that. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2118.0s)]
*  Why is it cost this much when a lot of the developmental cost for this is, you know, it's the software for it, right? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2121.0s)]
*  It's not like the servos and stuff are that expensive. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2128.0s)]
*  It's because we literally don't have the factories here to build that kind of robotic technology here. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2131.0s)]
*  And a lot of these applications, you know, because of national security concerns, it does need to be made locally here. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2140.0s)]
*  So here's a really concrete example of an industry that we need to be investing huge in for our national security. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2147.0s)]
*  You know, there are reasons to build these jobs at home. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2154.0s)]
*  If I were in Congress, I would be going to Boston Dynamics and saying, you want some free like tax money to go invest in some factories and start building servos and all this drone technology here? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2157.0s)]
*  Great. Let's do a second Chips Act. Let's do this. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2167.0s)]
*  It's a national security issue. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2170.0s)]
*  So for us to do that, we've got to bring in people from China with that kind of manufacturing expertise. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2172.0s)]
*  Like these companies have tried to build these things locally. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2178.0s)]
*  And it's just we literally don't have the kinds of experts in the United States that can go, oh, this screw needs to be tweaked a little bit for us to keep the factory going on this design. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2182.0s)]
*  We'll change it and have a new one out this afternoon. We don't have that expertise. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2193.0s)]
*  So if you're talking about like investing in America and creating a system where we can have that in five years, I'm 100% with you. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2197.0s)]
*  I just think if we're closing the door to that kind of expertise, I think it's going to make it so we literally cannot compete in these fields. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2205.0s)]
*  Are you both totally comfortable living in a country where someone like Elon Musk fires 4,000 workers to replace them by H1Bs? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2214.0s)]
*  No. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2224.0s)]
*  Is that so? So on what ground? Can we all agree that that is dastardly? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2225.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2229.0s)]
*  Just to get cheaper workers to do the same thing? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2230.0s)]
*  No. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2233.0s)]
*  Mary? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2234.0s)]
*  I don't know if I would think it's dastardly. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2235.0s)]
*  I want to ask you guys a question about the politics of this because Batya, you're a fan of Steve Bannon. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2237.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon is going around talking about, I guess he has like five days left to do it, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2244.0s)]
*  how he's going to do anything to keep Elon Musk out of the new administration and how it's a personal goal of his to, quote, take this guy down. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2249.0s)]
*  I don't see that happening. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2258.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think that Trump, who has come out strongly in favor of H1B visas and very much on the side of Musk and Ramaswami in this debate, is going to change course. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2260.0s)]
*  Do you? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2272.0s)]
*  Like, and where is it making you sit vis-a-vis Trump in this direction of the new White House? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2273.0s)]
*  I think Steve Bannon is America's number one anti-racist. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2280.0s)]
*  And I think that he's the most important voice if you want to understand where the Trump base is and where the working class is. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2283.0s)]
*  So with my cards on the table, I really hope he wins. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2292.0s)]
*  I don't know if he will. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2295.0s)]
*  If he doesn't, I will have a very different view of Trump going into this administration. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2296.0s)]
*  Well, one thing that we haven't touched on that I'm obviously like you guys both saw this. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2300.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if listeners who are not perpetually online like us did the racism on the right that came out around this issue was really, really disgusting. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2306.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't even want to quote the kinds of things they said, but it basically amounted to why did why do we want these smelly Indians in our country? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2317.0s)]
*  Get out. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2325.0s)]
*  This is, you know, America's for white people. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2326.0s)]
*  Like how long how long should we be about those voices? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2328.0s)]
*  Do they represent a real constituency? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2332.0s)]
*  Do they represent the base? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2335.0s)]
*  Like how should we understand that, Brianna or Bata either of you? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2337.0s)]
*  I mean, I got to be honest. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2341.0s)]
*  I think that it is we saw like Indian people online. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2343.0s)]
*  They voted for Trump that, you know, had some second thoughts about it after seeing that that backlash. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2348.0s)]
*  You know, I'm going to say respectfully, Steve Bannon has personally made my life much worse 10 years ago during GamerGate. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2355.0s)]
*  So I may not be quite as big a fan of him as you are, but you know, there's definitely this, you know, like both sides have our extremists. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2362.0s)]
*  Like it's just undeniable. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2371.0s)]
*  There is definitely a racist undercurrent that exists in the Republican Party. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2372.0s)]
*  I don't think it's everyone. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2377.0s)]
*  I don't think it's every Trump voter. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2378.0s)]
*  But I think like if we're talking about the vibe shift, the biggest gift that, you know, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2380.0s)]
*  the Republicans could give to the Democrats that could just keep the stalemate going is to not check this and not denounce it the same way that frankly Democrats have refused to denounce anti-Semitism over the last year and a half. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2385.0s)]
*  So I think it's a real threat and I think I'll need to deal with it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2398.0s)]
*  I'll just say quickly, I saw very little of it. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2403.0s)]
*  I did see some of it, but I saw very little of it. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2406.0s)]
*  The number one victims of mass immigration into the United States have been Black Americans who have suffered in massive, massive ways from being replaced by foreign workers. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2409.0s)]
*  It is forbidden to talk about this on the left. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2419.0s)]
*  They call any attempt to stand up for Americans at the expense of non-Americans racism. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2422.0s)]
*  And so like I refuse to accept that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2429.0s)]
*  Like I will be speaking on behalf of Black Americans and working class Americans until the day I die. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2432.0s)]
*  So I deplore any racism, but this was not about racism. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2438.0s)]
*  This was not about race. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2442.0s)]
*  It was uniquely about Indians because they represent a massively disproportionate number of H1Bs. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2444.0s)]
*  Again, as somebody who's quarter Indian, you know, I certainly I saw very little of it, even though I was on the lookout for it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2449.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't see a lot of it, although I saw some of it. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2455.0s)]
*  I don't want to deny that it was there, but it was certainly not, you know, present in any of the many conversations I've heard Steve Bannon have about it that I've had about it. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2457.0s)]
*  That the you know, I've been swimming in these waters doing very little else talking about very little else since Christmas. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2465.0s)]
*  And I don't think this is a big part of the movement. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2470.0s)]
*  I don't think it's significant in terms of that it represents why people feel so strongly about this. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2474.0s)]
*  You have insight, I think. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2482.0s)]
*  And tell me is is nationalist populist the right way to explain kind of the Bannon wing of the party? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2484.0s)]
*  How would you describe it? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2492.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a good way. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2493.0s)]
*  Yeah. So like you swim in those waters, you speak to those people. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2494.0s)]
*  How a how enraged are they about the way Trump broke on this issue? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2498.0s)]
*  And B, do you think that this is a fight that we're going to kind of continue to see play itself out over and over again? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2503.0s)]
*  Between sort of like call it MAGA 1.0, the nationalist populist that drove him to power in 2016 and perhaps representing Trump's base. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2511.0s)]
*  Unclear to me. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2520.0s)]
*  And then sort of MAGA 2.0 with Rama Swami and a lot of these other Silicon Valley types. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2521.0s)]
*  Like, let's talk a little bit about that dynamic, because I think it's extremely interesting and a big one for people to watch. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2526.0s)]
*  People are infuriated, infuriated. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2532.0s)]
*  I've seen so many people. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2536.0s)]
*  People reached out to me personally to say, you know, wow, mask off moment from Elon. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2537.0s)]
*  I used to admire him. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2542.0s)]
*  I honestly think Vivek's political aspirations may have he may have really hurt himself by that long tweet thread about how Americans are addicted to mediocrity and have a culture of loser dumb. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2543.0s)]
*  So I think that this this is going to have a really big implication. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2555.0s)]
*  You know, last time around at some point, Ann Coulter, who was a huge proponent of Trump, the one of the few people predicted that he was going to win. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2559.0s)]
*  She really turned on him because she felt that he sold out the controlling the border because basically Wall Street called him and were like, where are slaves at? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2570.0s)]
*  You know, like you're doing too good a job there. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2577.0s)]
*  And so he eased up some of the border restrictions. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2579.0s)]
*  This is her narrative. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2581.0s)]
*  And so she really turned on him. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2582.0s)]
*  She got very angry. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2583.0s)]
*  She supported DeSantis in the primary. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2584.0s)]
*  So it's not like there wasn't sort of pro-business forces trying to influence Trump the first time around. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2586.0s)]
*  He's much more focused this time around. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2592.0s)]
*  He is much more intentional. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2594.0s)]
*  He's very I mean, he's sort of like very laser focused on the agenda. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2596.0s)]
*  So it'll be very interesting to see. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2601.0s)]
*  I cannot predict who's going to win this. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2603.0s)]
*  I think it's significant that Steve Bannon has, you know, is talking about it so vigorously, like obviously that signals that Trump, I think to me, if I had to read that, I would say it signals Trump wants this debate to happen in the public sphere so he can decide which way to go on it. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2605.0s)]
*  But I can't say which way it'll it'll it'll end up. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2623.0s)]
*  OK, one thing, you know, we spoke we were speaking earlier about the vibe shift and, you know, Maria Shriver sort of turning against California Democrats, at least subtly to me is a big sign of it. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2627.0s)]
*  Another huge sign of it from another part of California, more northern part of California is Mark Zuckerberg and the direction that he is taking meta. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2638.0s)]
*  Watching the five minute. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2649.0s)]
*  I don't think you can find sort of a better emblem of the vibe shift than this five minute video that he put out announcing that they were getting rid of their fact checking apparatus, which had been accused of being deeply politically biased that they were moving parts of the company to Texas that that they're unwinding. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2652.0s)]
*  I mean, like he went on Joe Rogan and talked about how corporate America has become feminized. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2667.0s)]
*  Like it was just like this really red pill moment. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2673.0s)]
*  Brianna, let's start with you. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2676.0s)]
*  What did you think about this move? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2677.0s)]
*  Like a sincere change of heart opportunism. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2679.0s)]
*  What is it auger for the next four years? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2682.0s)]
*  I think I'm going to get yelled at for saying this by my friends in the Democratic Party, but I kind of support it. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2684.0s)]
*  And let me tell you why, because he started that video off Mark Zuckerberg talking about how they made some systems in good faith. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2690.0s)]
*  And he's found out that they've just been very abusable. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2697.0s)]
*  And as someone whose job has literally been to run many a Facebook ad campaign or advise on them or help develop messaging for them, like I've done this. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2701.0s)]
*  This is literally my job. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2711.0s)]
*  Right. So I've seen firsthand how these systems are abused over and over and over again to report content. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2713.0s)]
*  There's in no way even borderline TOS, but it just upset some people. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2720.0s)]
*  TOS meaning violating the terms of service. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2726.0s)]
*  Terms of service. Right. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2729.0s)]
*  So what I've seen is functionally the way these systems have been put in place at Facebook in my personal experience is it's just a race to the bottom of which side. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2730.0s)]
*  Can cynically attack the other and can mash report it like I've seen these groups. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2742.0s)]
*  You get together in this group, you decide you don't like blah, blah, ad, and you're just going to go masterport it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2747.0s)]
*  This is just simply the way that both parties have had to operate. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2753.0s)]
*  So I share his assessment that it's just so broken that for us to have an open dialogue, the community note system is going to be better. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2757.0s)]
*  And look, every single sister I've talked to out there. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2766.0s)]
*  It doesn't make me happy to hear some of the things they're going to be saying about transgender people. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2769.0s)]
*  Now, it's very hurtful. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2774.0s)]
*  Like this. This discussion is not going to be humanizing. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2776.0s)]
*  It's just I feel like we've either got to we've tried this playbook of silencing the other side when they're saying some truly vile stuff. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2779.0s)]
*  And it just has utterly failed. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2789.0s)]
*  Like for everyone, women, black people, gay people, trans people up and down the line trying to silence speech is just making our enemies that much stronger. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2791.0s)]
*  And I think moving forward, it's got to move back to an old school liberal idea. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2801.0s)]
*  We've just got to have an answer for this stuff. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2806.0s)]
*  And we've got to hit these ideas directly and have a better argument. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2808.0s)]
*  Do you think that this Zuckerberg pivot signals that we're post woke? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2811.0s)]
*  Like, or what does it mean? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2817.0s)]
*  Barry, it is so weird to me because I talked to Democratic operatives and it's like they just they're like these fighters in World War Two that don't know that the wars have. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2820.0s)]
*  Right. We lost. We lost. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2832.0s)]
*  We're moving into a new era. The vibe shift is real. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2834.0s)]
*  And they're sitting there posting their outrage and saying they're going to leave Facebook. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2837.0s)]
*  I can point to like 20 people that I know that are doing this. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2841.0s)]
*  It's like this is not going to work. It's not going to change it. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2844.0s)]
*  This is where America is. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2847.0s)]
*  They want free speech. They want open discussion. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2849.0s)]
*  They're tired of things being verboten for them to say. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2851.0s)]
*  And it's just so enraging that Democrats don't seem to understand this yet. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2854.0s)]
*  The New York Times ran a headline this a few days ago that read like a Babylon B headline or an onion headline from the old days. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2859.0s)]
*  It said, Metta says fact checkers were the problem. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2867.0s)]
*  Fact checkers rule that false. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2870.0s)]
*  I couldn't tell if it was a joke or not. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2872.0s)]
*  But anything else you want to say about that? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2874.0s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that headline. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2877.0s)]
*  No, just Glenn Greenwald had such a funny point. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2879.0s)]
*  He pointed out that in the video, Zuckerberg had a whole new wardrobe, like a whole new look like he'd look. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2881.0s)]
*  He didn't look like like a Silicon Valley bro anymore. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2889.0s)]
*  He looked now like a crypto bro, like he had the like the T-shirt and the necklace and the and it was like a whole different. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2893.0s)]
*  And it's almost like he's now in his next era. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2900.0s)]
*  And it just reads so false to me. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2903.0s)]
*  I mean, like, I'm glad that they're doing it, but it's just such it's just evidence like you both were saying, like of the vibe shift and nothing more. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2905.0s)]
*  And just like that private companies, you know, that once like, you know, made their bread and butter off of being hashtag resistance. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2913.0s)]
*  Wokesters are now trying to sort of like tack to the middle because they realize that that's where the money is and that's where the advantage is. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2920.0s)]
*  Like, obviously, nobody has any morals in this business, but it's you know, it really suggests that like people have understood that nobody is buying that earlier version anymore. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2927.0s)]
*  And we've really fully turned a new page. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2937.0s)]
*  I don't know. I sort of see it as like this. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2939.0s)]
*  I guess what Timor Curran would call preference falsification. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2944.0s)]
*  Like people have been living over the past decade with private truths, you know, like saying in private woke is a little crazy or is a lot crazy, but in public, you know, putting up the right hashtags or the black squares or whatever you're supposed to do. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2947.0s)]
*  And I think what's happened since November 5th and maybe actually since the attempted assassination against Trump on July 13th is just the shattering of that. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2961.0s)]
*  Like illusion, I think that people who sincerely felt like and maybe Mark Zuckerberg is one of these people you could look to, you know, for earlier evidence of the vibe shift, you could look to his desire to raise and butcher his own animals or getting into jujitsu. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2973.0s)]
*  There were signs is all I'm saying is like now the water's warm right now that it's sort of like politically and culturally and socially and reputationally acceptable. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=2990.0s)]
*  More people are coming out and just being like, Hey, that was a little crazy. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3001.0s)]
*  And that's how I see it. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3005.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about this because I feel some type of way to see all the people who called me racist for pointing out that like the real divine America is class. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3006.0s)]
*  It's not race. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3015.0s)]
*  All these people called me racist for saying this like five years ago, four years ago, three years ago. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3016.0s)]
*  And now they're all saying it with like without a shred of like self reflection, like, oh, maybe like all these people's lives we tried to destroy. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3021.0s)]
*  Like they actually were saying this. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3029.0s)]
*  Do you feel like resentful about that? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3032.0s)]
*  Or you just feel grateful that it's over? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3034.0s)]
*  I think I'm having whiplash. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3036.0s)]
*  Like what's the line in Ferris Bueller? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3038.0s)]
*  Like life comes at you fast. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3040.0s)]
*  Like every time I turn around, another person that I regarded as sort of like a zombie politically is now like come to life. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3041.0s)]
*  Peter Thiel actually had a quite an interesting piece in the Financial Times over the weekend calling for almost like a truth and reconciliation commission saying saying basically which which speaks to your point. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3049.0s)]
*  Like he's basically saying it's really nice. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3060.0s)]
*  I'm going to paraphrase this, but he basically says that in order for us to truly move on, it's not enough for people to just like have a change of heart. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3063.0s)]
*  We basically need an accountability. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3071.0s)]
*  We need we need a Twitter files for everything that's happened from the cover up of the lab leak to you know, and he named a bunch of other things. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3073.0s)]
*  And I felt like that was it's anyway. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3081.0s)]
*  It's really, really provocative and like everything Peter says and very much worth a read. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3083.0s)]
*  We have three minutes left before Batya needs to go and yap on television. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3087.0s)]
*  So last thing confirmation hearings start this week. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3092.0s)]
*  We're recording this in the afternoon of Monday, January 13th. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3096.0s)]
*  Tomorrow Senate hearings are going to begin for several of Trump's cabinet picks. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3099.0s)]
*  They don't need Democrats to pass these appointments, but there might be some Republican holdouts for the more controversial picks like let's say Pete Hegseth for defense or Robert F. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3104.0s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. for HHS or maybe Cash Patel for FBI. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3113.0s)]
*  What are your predictions from for these guys specifically Hegseth, Kennedy, Patel? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3117.0s)]
*  Are they going to make their way through? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3122.0s)]
*  Or is you know, Susan Collins going to stop stop them from from getting to their appointments? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3124.0s)]
*  What do you think? Is Hegseth going to be defense secretary? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3130.0s)]
*  Is RFK Jr. going to run HHS and is Cash Patel going to run FBI? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3133.0s)]
*  Let's have answers from both of you. Pete Hegseth. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3138.0s)]
*  Yay or nay, Brianna. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3140.0s)]
*  Going to make it through. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3142.0s)]
*  I don't think so now. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3143.0s)]
*  Batya. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3144.0s)]
*  Instead of doing a prediction, which I'm always wrong about those. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3145.0s)]
*  So I'll just give you a little insight into something that happened over the weekend, which is I ran an op edit Newsweek by Greg Kelly, who's a Newsmax host, which if I tell you that you would assume that this would be very pro Pete Hegseth. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3149.0s)]
*  But actually what he argues is that Pete Hegseth has already shown himself susceptible to being blackmailed because he was blackmailed by this woman who accused him of sexual harassment and assault, etc. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3162.0s)]
*  And the fact that that came in, I think that there are people looking for cover to Demura and Pete Hegseth, which I was surprised by. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3173.0s)]
*  So there's a little more pushback than I was expecting on that one. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3182.0s)]
*  And as far as the other two, you know, the person to watch, it's John Fetterman. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3186.0s)]
*  I mean, talk about the MVP. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3191.0s)]
*  This guy has come out and just had, you know, a spine of steel meeting Trump, meeting all these people and saying, you know, if we he said about the Lake and Riley Act, if we can't get seven Democratic senators to vote for this thing, we deserve to lose. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3193.0s)]
*  Like just calling all of the truth bombs out there. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3206.0s)]
*  And I think he had a really nice meeting with R.F.K. Jr. actually and Pete Hegseth. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3209.0s)]
*  So, you know, there might be more Democratic support than we're expecting. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3213.0s)]
*  This is what our party needs to do desperately. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3216.0s)]
*  We've got to work with the Republicans where it makes sense. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3218.0s)]
*  Find common ground. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3221.0s)]
*  This is I'm old enough to remember when this is how it used to work instead. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3222.0s)]
*  Digging your heels in and then Bush one point two point. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3226.0s)]
*  Oh, happen. But this is my message to you about it. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3229.0s)]
*  It's like as a Democratic operative, I almost hope this chaos happens. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3232.0s)]
*  But I think the Republicans would be very smart to put the kibosh on Elon's involvement, like the way he tilted the, you know, the debt ceiling crisis a few weeks ago, tried to put himself in the middle of the government. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3236.0s)]
*  That's going to be really bad news for the Republicans if that stands. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3250.0s)]
*  And I think if you can, if you can put the kibosh on this and get some confident people in there, I think I have a lot of Democrats that are going to go the Federman way and are willing to get some stuff done for the American people. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3253.0s)]
*  I think if it's just the crazy what's going to happen, you're going to give us the ammo we need to dig our heels in and go complain on resistance. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3266.0s)]
*  Twitter is just going to be like 2016 all over again. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3274.0s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3277.0s)]
*  Okay, well, Batya Angusargan, Brianna Wu, next time we talk, Trump will be the president of the United States. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3279.0s)]
*  So eager to see what happens this week in the Senate, what happens on Inauguration Day. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmND2-ME2Q&t=3285.0s)]
