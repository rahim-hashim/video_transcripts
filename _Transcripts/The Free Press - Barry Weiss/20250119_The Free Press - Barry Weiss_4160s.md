# Sen. Ted Cruz on TikTok, China, the Ceasefire Deal, and Much More
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY)
*  From the free press, live in DC, and presented by Uber and X, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=0.0s)]
*  this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4.4s)]
*  There are conservatives in America. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  There are hardcore conservatives. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=8.94s)]
*  And then there are conservatives who have been meme-ified [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=10.94s)]
*  as the Zodiac Killer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=13.44s)]
*  To put it differently, Senator Ted Cruz [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=15.34s)]
*  doesn't do kinder and gentler. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=17.48s)]
*  He likes to squabble. He likes to fight. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=19.28s)]
*  But once the fight is over, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=21.32s)]
*  he might wind up just becoming your best friend. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=22.72s)]
*  During the rough and tumble of the 2016 primary, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=25.82s)]
*  President Trump said that Cruz's dad helped kill JFK. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=29.46s)]
*  There were shots back and forth. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=33.92s)]
*  Cruz called Trump a pathological liar and a sniveling coward [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  and tweeted that he can't be trusted with common sense. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=38.2s)]
*  Why would we trust him in the White House? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=41.1s)]
*  And yet, once it was all over, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=43.7s)]
*  Senator Cruz responded by shepherding [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  hundreds of Trump judges through the Judiciary Committee, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=47.78s)]
*  including three Supreme Court picks. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=51.24s)]
*  By 2018, Senator Cruz was praising Trump [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=53.58s)]
*  as a flash-bang grenade thrown into Washington [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  by the forgotten men and women of America. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=60.04s)]
*  And at the Republican convention this year, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=62.42s)]
*  you bellowed, God bless Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=65.02s)]
*  No wonder the president has called your relationship [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  a little bit of a romance. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  Ted Cruz is practically synonymous [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=72.9s)]
*  with the word conservative. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=75.02000000000001s)]
*  Look it up in the dictionary [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=76.2s)]
*  and you will see a picture of Ted Cruz [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=77.44s)]
*  explaining why a hospital for kittens [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=79.8s)]
*  is a waste of taxpayer money, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=81.84s)]
*  a product of Harvard Law and the Tea Party. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=84.16s)]
*  He was MAGA before MAGA was a thing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=86.66s)]
*  and the counter-elite before it was cool. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=88.82s)]
*  Now Ted Cruz is understandably doing a victory lap [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=91.55999999999999s)]
*  because the vibe shift that happened this November [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=94.5s)]
*  was a shift in his direction [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  and arguably one he helped facilitate. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  The new GOP is one he helped build [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=101.6s)]
*  and will no doubt guide into the future [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=104.63999999999999s)]
*  and perhaps even to other planets. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=106.58s)]
*  Ted Cruz is the new chairman [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=110.58s)]
*  That's the one that oversees space travel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=113.56s)]
*  and no doubt he's already coming up with plans [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=115.84s)]
*  to lower the taxes of those in galaxies far away. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=117.84s)]
*  I could not be more excited to be here with you today, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=120.9s)]
*  Senator Cruz, thank you so much for joining me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=122.98s)]
*  Well, Barry, thank you by the way. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=124.98s)]
*  That was one hell of an introduction. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=126.28s)]
*  You will forgive me if I copy it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=128.28s)]
*  and I may play it for my wife Heidi. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=130.08s)]
*  Take it, use it, play it for Heidi. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=131.76s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=133.62s)]
*  Okay, so let's start with the news. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=134.46s)]
*  Tomorrow morning, unless Hamas [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=136.32s)]
*  or some other terrorist actor derails the deal, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=138.5s)]
*  the first three hostages, dead or alive, we don't know, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  are gonna be returned into Israel from Gaza. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=145.0s)]
*  Three of the 33, again, dead or alive, we don't know. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=148.58s)]
*  Now democracies always say they don't negotiate [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=152.52s)]
*  with terrorists and yet that is what Israel, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=155.28s)]
*  with the pressure or support, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  depending on how you see it, of the United States, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=159.3s)]
*  that is what they've just done [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=161.4s)]
*  because in exchange for these 33, of course, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=162.58s)]
*  there's gonna be more than 1,000 Palestinian terrorists, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=164.82000000000002s)]
*  murderers, people in Israeli prisons are gonna be released. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=168.34s)]
*  Is this a good strategy? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=172.82s)]
*  So I have candidly mixed sentiments on the deal. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=174.66s)]
*  Let's start with the top line. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=177.7s)]
*  Hostages being released, that is unequivocally good. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=179.98s)]
*  That is cause for celebration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=184.06s)]
*  Every hostage needs to be released [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  and we will celebrate every Israeli hostage [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=188.26s)]
*  who is released, every American hostage who is released [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  and that is a very good thing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  The precise contours of the deal [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  are still not entirely clear. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=199.62s)]
*  I do worry about number one, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=202.44s)]
*  the terrorists that are going to be released from jail [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=206.36s)]
*  as part of this deal and I worry about six months from now [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=209.8s)]
*  those terrorists murdering additional people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=213.96s)]
*  I also worry about Hamas remaining in power in Gaza. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  I think that is an enormous problem [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  and so where we are right now, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=225.52s)]
*  I am cautiously watching what plays out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=231.34s)]
*  Now, we shouldn't be here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=234.4s)]
*  This occurred because of catastrophic failures [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=238.78s)]
*  from the Biden White House. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=243.18s)]
*  I don't believe October 7th happens [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=244.82000000000002s)]
*  if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are not in the White House [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=247.58s)]
*  and so moving forward. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=251.82000000000002s)]
*  Say more about that because I mean, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=254.68s)]
*  people know how I feel about Israel [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=258.12s)]
*  regardless of how I feel about the government [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  but how can you not blame the Israeli government [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=262.68s)]
*  for hubris or believing somehow [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=265.48s)]
*  that being the startup nation and the high tech superpower [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=269.76s)]
*  would prevent the crossing over the border [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=272.52s)]
*  by people paragliders in trucks? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=277.0s)]
*  How is that not a failure of the Israeli government? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=278.92s)]
*  Why is it more Biden and Kamala's fault? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=280.64s)]
*  Because the United States [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=282.82s)]
*  is the indispensable nation in the world [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  and when you have a strong president [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=286.62s)]
*  and a strong commander in chief, our enemies are afraid [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  and when you have a weak president [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=290.94s)]
*  and a weak commander in chief, our enemies are emboldened [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=292.38s)]
*  and I think over four years, what we've seen, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  number one, Joe Biden, for four years, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=298.12s)]
*  our friends and allies don't trust us [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=300.86s)]
*  and our enemies don't fear us. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=302.82s)]
*  Rewind to the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=305.42s)]
*  That was catastrophic on multiple levels [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=309.86s)]
*  but one of the consequences [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=312.56s)]
*  and something I said publicly at the time, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=313.72s)]
*  I said the chances of Russia invading Ukraine [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  have just risen tenfold [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  because every enemy of America [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=320.8s)]
*  is looking to the Oval Office, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=322.36s)]
*  taking the measure of the man in the Oval Office [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  and they've determined [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=326.36s)]
*  that the American commander in chief is weak. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  Hamas was emboldened by that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=329.44s)]
*  Hezbollah was emboldened by that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  Iran was emboldened by that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=333.48s)]
*  Number two, Joe Biden and this administration [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=336.16s)]
*  remains the most anti-Israel administration [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=341.16s)]
*  we have ever seen. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  They systematically came in from day one [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=345.98s)]
*  and began undermining the government of Israel [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=348.46000000000004s)]
*  and not only doing that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  but they began supporting the enemies of Israel [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=352.86s)]
*  and if you look at Iran, Iran is the head of the snake. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=356.18s)]
*  Joe Biden is responsible for flowing [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=361.1s)]
*  over $100 billion to Iran. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=363.46000000000004s)]
*  You may have seen when I've cross-examined Tony Blinken [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  as Secretary of State and tried to hold him to account. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=370.6s)]
*  Kamala Harris said on, I think it was 60 Minutes, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  that Iran is the greatest threat to America [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=376.04s)]
*  and what's astonishing because the corporate media [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=377.94s)]
*  no longer behaves like journalists. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=382.0s)]
*  They didn't ask the follow-up question, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=383.54s)]
*  well if they're the most dangerous enemy to America, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=385.12s)]
*  why the hell did you give them $100 billion? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=387.04s)]
*  That's not a subtle question. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=389.74s)]
*  It's not a complicated question. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=391.12s)]
*  But you think Biden, White House, vis-a-vis Israel [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=392.68s)]
*  worse than the Obama White House? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  Much more so. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=396.5s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=398.56s)]
*  Look, some of it is the Democrat Party has moved. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  So many of the people are the same people. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=403.08s)]
*  It's the same Obama folks that were undermining Israel [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=404.92s)]
*  but they're now, they're operating in the context [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=407.68s)]
*  of a Democrat Party where anti-Semitism is normalized, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=410.76s)]
*  where hatred of Israel is a significant part [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=414.4s)]
*  of the Democrat Party today. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  Let's take for example October 7th. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=422.08s)]
*  On the night of October 7th. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=425.8s)]
*  The State Department sent out a tweet [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  from the Office of Palestinian Affairs that said, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=432.4s)]
*  Israel must not respond. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=438.28s)]
*  There must be no military reaction whatsoever. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=439.92s)]
*  This is while the death squads are still murdering people. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=442.44s)]
*  It was three in the morning here in the United States [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=444.76s)]
*  when they sent that tweet out. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=446.86s)]
*  My team and I saw that tweet. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=447.98s)]
*  At three in the morning, we responded immediately [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=450.12s)]
*  with this is reprehensible. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=453.26s)]
*  Whoever wrote this tweet should be fired. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=454.68s)]
*  Within minutes they deleted the tweet. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=458.06s)]
*  Now you might say okay, that's a rogue staffer [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=460.8s)]
*  within the Office of Palestinian Affairs. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=464.08s)]
*  The next day, October 8th, Tony Blinken [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=466.8s)]
*  from his own Twitter account sent out a tweet [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=469.52s)]
*  the next day he said, I just got off the phone [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=472.08s)]
*  with the Turkish foreign minister. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=475.32s)]
*  We agreed Israel must not respond, must not retaliate. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=477.32s)]
*  There should be no military response whatsoever. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=481.08s)]
*  This is less than 24 hours after Hamas [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=483.4s)]
*  has murdered 1,200 civilians. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=486.76s)]
*  Again, I called that out. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=490.68s)]
*  Again, they deleted that tweet. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=491.52s)]
*  At every level since October 7th, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=493.56s)]
*  the Biden White House position [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=496.44s)]
*  has been stop killing the terrorists. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=497.76s)]
*  What I believe American foreign policy should be [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=500.28s)]
*  is we stand unequivocally with Israel. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=503.68s)]
*  And Israel is right in its commitment [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=506.14s)]
*  to utterly destroy Hamas. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=508.96s)]
*  And also that Israel has decimated Hezbollah as well. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=511.72s)]
*  Hezbollah put up its hand and said, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=515.24s)]
*  we wanna be part of this as well. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=517.28s)]
*  They may be regretting that, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=518.88s)]
*  although I think everyone who made that decision [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=520.0s)]
*  is no longer with us. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=521.68s)]
*  So that's a significant improvement. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=522.8s)]
*  Biden and Trump have both claimed credit for this deal. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=524.88s)]
*  The person who seemingly pulled off this deal [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=528.32s)]
*  is a real estate developer from the Bronx [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=530.7s)]
*  with no experience in the Middle East. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=533.06s)]
*  Who deserves credit? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=536.2s)]
*  Is it Steve Wittkopf? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=537.28s)]
*  Is it Donald Trump? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=538.28s)]
*  Is it the fact that Donald Trump put out that tweet [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=539.18s)]
*  saying there was gonna be, paraphrasing here, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=541.32s)]
*  maybe not by much, there's gonna be hell to pay [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=543.72s)]
*  if the hostages aren't released by inauguration. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=546.08s)]
*  Listen, this deal doesn't happen without Donald Trump. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=549.64s)]
*  If it's just the Biden administration, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=552.76s)]
*  there's a reason this hasn't happened [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=554.36s)]
*  for a year and four months since October 7th. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=556.64s)]
*  It is because Trump is coming in, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=561.16s)]
*  it is because of his comment, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=562.9399999999999s)]
*  there'll be hell to pay that was the impetus for this deal. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=564.0s)]
*  So I'm glad of it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=567.16s)]
*  I will celebrate every hostage who is released. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=568.08s)]
*  And this is something I've foreshadowed for some time [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=571.88s)]
*  that I believed we would see a release of hostages [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=574.4s)]
*  reminiscent of in 1981 when Reagan was being sworn in [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=577.9599999999999s)]
*  and Iran released our hostages on January 20th, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  on the day Reagan was sworn in. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=584.92s)]
*  So I think the Trump effect is very real. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=587.76s)]
*  But I don't think this deal puts everything behind us. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=591.7199999999999s)]
*  And I do think it is critically important [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  that America stand with Israel going forward [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=598.0999999999999s)]
*  and in particular, I expect continued bad action [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=601.12s)]
*  from Hamas and if and when Israel finds it necessary [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=605.36s)]
*  to respond to that continued bad action, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=609.88s)]
*  I am confident I believe America will stand with Israel [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=612.32s)]
*  in doing so. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=615.92s)]
*  I can tell you this week, I spent day before yesterday [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=617.04s)]
*  about 45 minutes on the phone with Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=621.88s)]
*  talking about the challenges they're facing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  And they're very concerned about what Hamas is going to do [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=628.04s)]
*  in the days and weeks ahead. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  That concern is right and understandable. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=632.2s)]
*  And I think it's important that America [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=635.88s)]
*  have Israel's back going forward. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=636.72s)]
*  The narrative around people kind of close to the deal [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=638.08s)]
*  was Bibi was just squeezed by Trump and by Witkoff. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=640.64s)]
*  He had to do what they said because he's thrown in his lot [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=644.4s)]
*  entirely with the GOP and with Trump, true? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=646.98s)]
*  Look, there's no doubt that the Trump team wanted a deal [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=650.88s)]
*  and they were pressing hard for a deal. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=654.64s)]
*  If and when hostages come home, that is a good thing. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=657.4s)]
*  So I will celebrate that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=660.28s)]
*  In terms of assessing the rest of the deal, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=661.84s)]
*  we're not gonna know until some time rolls forward. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, one last question on the deal. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  I have been shocked to discover, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=669.48s)]
*  it was just not a place I was looking, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=671.48s)]
*  but the more I've looked, the more shocking [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=673.0s)]
*  the picture becomes over the role of Qatar, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=675.88s)]
*  not just in this deal, but how much influence they have [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  over US foreign policy and frankly, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=682.32s)]
*  other key institutions in American life. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=685.44s)]
*  In the case of this deal, we essentially outsourced [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=688.5200000000001s)]
*  the negotiation to Doha, where the leaders of Hamas live. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=691.88s)]
*  Explain this to me. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=697.92s)]
*  How has this been allowed to happen? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=699.28s)]
*  How is this not a scandal? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=701.36s)]
*  Is Qatar a legitimate ally here? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=703.0s)]
*  Like explain the role of Qatar and why this has been [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=705.96s)]
*  such an overlooked aspect of American [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=709.28s)]
*  foreign policy right now. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=712.64s)]
*  Listen, I think we need absolute clarity [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=713.6s)]
*  when it comes to Qatar and Qatar has repeatedly [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=715.94s)]
*  gotten in bed with enemies of America [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=718.36s)]
*  and supported enemies of America [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=720.16s)]
*  and supported enemies of Israel. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=721.44s)]
*  I've introduced legislation that would sanction Qatar [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=723.08s)]
*  back to the Stone Age. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=725.48s)]
*  So my view on this is not complicated. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=726.88s)]
*  By the way, to be clear, the Qatari government [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=728.76s)]
*  has also paid for spies to personally surveil me. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=730.92s)]
*  So they understand exactly where I stand on this issue. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=733.88s)]
*  My view in terms of my view of foreign countries [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=737.08s)]
*  comes down to one simple thing. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=739.64s)]
*  Are you our friend or enemy? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=740.98s)]
*  Are you behaving like our friend [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=742.24s)]
*  or are you behaving like our enemy? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=743.52s)]
*  I believe in clarity and let's step back for a second. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=745.24s)]
*  You and I have both followed foreign policy [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=749.36s)]
*  and Middle East foreign policy for a long, long time. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=751.96s)]
*  If you look at the first Trump administration, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=756.28s)]
*  particularly by the end of the first Trump term, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=758.36s)]
*  we saw peace flowering in the Middle East [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=761.48s)]
*  in a way that had not happened in either of our lifetimes. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=764.72s)]
*  Totally. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=767.0s)]
*  A rational and reasonable person would engage [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=768.78s)]
*  in some introspection to say, okay, well, what changed? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=771.88s)]
*  Why suddenly are we seeing the Abraham Accords? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=774.44s)]
*  Why are we seeing Arabs and Israelis coming together? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=777.4s)]
*  And I think there's a reason, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=781.0799999999999s)]
*  which is historically the enlightened view in Washington [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=782.24s)]
*  about the Middle East in particular, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  is that you should have deliberate and studied ambiguity. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=788.5s)]
*  That what America gives with one hand, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=792.12s)]
*  it takes away with the other. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=794.04s)]
*  And we saw this from Democrat administrations [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=795.86s)]
*  and sadly a lot of Republican administrations. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  They'd say, oh, a little bit of Israel, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=800.0s)]
*  a little bit of the Palestinians, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=802.0s)]
*  a little bit of this, a little bit of that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=803.16s)]
*  And that ambiguity, all of the gray beards in Washington [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=804.54s)]
*  said was the smart approach. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=808.3399999999999s)]
*  I have to tell you, I've always thought [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=810.14s)]
*  that was an imbecilic approach. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=811.48s)]
*  But don't you think we have exactly that ambiguity [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=813.14s)]
*  vis-a-vis Qatar right now? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=815.26s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=816.8399999999999s)]
*  And I will say this, so let's rewind to Trump term one, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=817.98s)]
*  because to be clear, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=821.4599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump hasn't been sworn in yet for the second term, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=822.74s)]
*  so it's a bit early to render judgments [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=825.06s)]
*  on what the foreign policy will be for the next four years. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=828.54s)]
*  But in Trump term one, I will tell you [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=831.74s)]
*  the two most important foreign policy decisions, I believe, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=833.92s)]
*  were number one, the decision to move [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=837.5999999999999s)]
*  the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=839.4s)]
*  and number two, the decision to pull out [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  of the disastrous Obama-Iran nuclear deal. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  On both of those decisions, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=847.8399999999999s)]
*  there were battles within the Trump administration, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=849.4799999999999s)]
*  big serious battles. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=852.04s)]
*  On moving the embassy to Jerusalem, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=853.56s)]
*  both state and defense opposed that. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  Rex Tillerson and Jim Mattis argued vociferously [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=857.5999999999999s)]
*  that doing so would inflame the enemies of Israel [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=861.04s)]
*  and the enemies of America. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=864.12s)]
*  I tell you, I went to the Oval a dozen times or more [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=865.0799999999999s)]
*  arguing for moving the embassy [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=868.8399999999999s)]
*  and pointing out the enemies of Israel already hate us. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=871.14s)]
*  And the right approach is not this studied ambiguity, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=874.52s)]
*  but draw a line in the sand [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=878.06s)]
*  and say we stand with Israel unequivocally. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=879.4s)]
*  President Trump agreed with me, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=883.9s)]
*  overruled his own secretary of state, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=886.18s)]
*  his own secretary of defense. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=888.0s)]
*  Same thing on the Iran nuclear deal. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=889.12s)]
*  Both state and defense opposed pulling out of that deal. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=892.4s)]
*  I probably went two dozen times to the Oval [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=895.1s)]
*  to make the case that we needed to pull out of the deal. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=897.48s)]
*  Again, Trump agreed with me, overruled state and defense. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=899.5600000000001s)]
*  Those decisions, fast forward to the Abraham Accords. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=904.18s)]
*  I was on the South Lawn of the White House [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=907.08s)]
*  when the Abraham Accords were signed. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=908.64s)]
*  In that week, I spoke with the foreign minister [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=911.04s)]
*  and ambassadors from UAE and Bahrain. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=913.5600000000001s)]
*  They both said almost word for word the same thing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=916.82s)]
*  They said, we want to be friends with America. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=921.62s)]
*  We now understand that America stands [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=927.34s)]
*  unequivocally with Israel, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=929.86s)]
*  therefore we will be friends with Israel. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=932.38s)]
*  That's the power of clarity. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=935.14s)]
*  That's what produced the peace. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=937.6s)]
*  Joe Biden came in and immediately returned [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=939.86s)]
*  to the study to ambiguity undermining Israel. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=942.4200000000001s)]
*  I think that is a major part of what produced October 7th. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=944.92s)]
*  I want to ask you a question about the airlines [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=948.84s)]
*  flying to Israel and then we'll move on to other topics. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=950.88s)]
*  I want to talk about China and the TikTok [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=953.0s)]
*  Supreme Court decision, which seems [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=955.48s)]
*  really important right now. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=957.04s)]
*  There are currently no American airlines, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=958.74s)]
*  no US airlines flying to Israel right now [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=961.04s)]
*  and they haven't been for months. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=963.24s)]
*  The airlines claim it's because of safety [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=964.68s)]
*  and ongoing conflict in the region. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=966.62s)]
*  You say it's because of anti-Semitism. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=969.02s)]
*  What's the real story? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  Look, I think they need to resume the flights. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=972.6s)]
*  I think US airlines need to resume flights to Israel. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=974.96s)]
*  We have El Al that has flights, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=978.16s)]
*  we have regional airlines in the Middle East, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=980.08s)]
*  in Europe that are having flights go in and out [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=983.76s)]
*  and I think it is politics that is driving that decision [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=985.88s)]
*  rather than their stated concerns. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=989.24s)]
*  I'll point out. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=991.92s)]
*  Politics on the part of the unions? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=992.76s)]
*  Yes, in particular you look at the flight attendant union [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  that has been very vocally anti-Israel [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=997.88s)]
*  but in fact has supported the anti-Semitic protests [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1002.16s)]
*  on college campuses. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1004.52s)]
*  And listen, I'm the incoming chairman [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1006.12s)]
*  of the Senate Commerce Committee that has jurisdiction over, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1008.92s)]
*  among other things, has jurisdiction over 40% [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1011.12s)]
*  of the US economy, including aviation. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  So what can be done? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1015.56s)]
*  A lot can be done. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1016.7199999999999s)]
*  I think this will be fixed. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1017.9599999999999s)]
*  Give us a little preview. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1019.36s)]
*  What can be done? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1020.1999999999999s)]
*  A lot can be done, but going back [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1021.4399999999999s)]
*  to drawing a line in the sand. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1024.32s)]
*  Come on, come on. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1026.32s)]
*  I'm gonna predict within 30 days [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1029.8999999999999s)]
*  they'll resume flights. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1031.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1033.0800000000002s)]
*  I think clarity has enormous power [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1036.68s)]
*  and there are too many people in politics [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1040.44s)]
*  that don't speak clearly. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  By the way, my hope is, let's take Iran. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1045.52s)]
*  My hope is that on January 20th, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1048.88s)]
*  this policy of appeasement towards Iran ends immediately [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1053.56s)]
*  and we see a return to maximum pressure. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1056.8s)]
*  And again, let's rewind to Trump one [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1060.0s)]
*  because this is important. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1062.08s)]
*  All right, so after we pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1063.8s)]
*  there were a whole series of waivers that remained in place [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1066.52s)]
*  that left bad policies in place. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1069.08s)]
*  The most important of which was an oil waiver [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1072.04s)]
*  that gave Iran a waiver from sanctions [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1075.12s)]
*  to allow it to sell oil. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1077.3s)]
*  Now, oil is the principal source of revenue [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1078.42s)]
*  for the Iranian government. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1080.76s)]
*  And so after Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1082.74s)]
*  I began leading the fight to end the oil waivers. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1085.98s)]
*  Now, in this instance, there was a different fight [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1089.38s)]
*  within the Trump administration. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1091.7800000000002s)]
*  It was a fight between state and energy. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1092.94s)]
*  So Mike Pompeo has started as the new secretary of state. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1095.5400000000002s)]
*  State's position, at the time, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1099.0200000000002s)]
*  Iran was selling roughly a million barrels a day of oil. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1100.66s)]
*  State's position was if you end the oil waivers, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1103.94s)]
*  the price of oil will skyrocket globally, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1108.5200000000002s)]
*  that'll raise the price of gasoline at home, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1110.6200000000001s)]
*  so do not end the oil waivers. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1112.46s)]
*  The Department of Energy, which you might think [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1115.0400000000002s)]
*  would know something about energy, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1117.14s)]
*  said that's ridiculous, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1120.06s)]
*  there's plenty of global supply of oil, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1120.9s)]
*  you can end the oil waivers [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1122.1000000000001s)]
*  and it's not gonna impact the price. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1123.22s)]
*  I engaged vigorously again and said, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1124.66s)]
*  end the oil waivers now. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1127.66s)]
*  Again, Trump agreed with me, so we overruled state. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1129.02s)]
*  And we now know the answer, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1132.02s)]
*  which is state was wrong and energy was right. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1133.92s)]
*  We ended the oil waivers, Iran's oil sales plummeted, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1135.98s)]
*  and the price of oil didn't move globally. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1139.78s)]
*  It had no effect, had no effect on gasoline here at home. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1141.42s)]
*  But for Iran, their sales fell [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1144.96s)]
*  from a million barrels a day [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1147.02s)]
*  to at the end of the Trump administration [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1149.32s)]
*  to 300,000 barrels a day. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1150.6s)]
*  The consequence, the Iranian economy was in shambles, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1152.44s)]
*  the regime was teetering, I think it was near collapse. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1156.42s)]
*  Joe Biden came in and riding a white horse [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1160.0s)]
*  to the rescue of the Ayatollah [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1163.68s)]
*  immediately began enforcing the oil sanctions. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1166.44s)]
*  Today, Iran is selling two million barrels a day of oil. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1169.64s)]
*  They went from 300,000 barrels a day of oil [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1174.6s)]
*  to two million barrels a day of oil. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1177.52s)]
*  That is over $80 billion. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1179.8799999999999s)]
*  And understand Iran provides 90% of the funding to Hamas [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1182.12s)]
*  and 90% of the funding to Hezbollah. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1186.2s)]
*  In a very real sense, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1188.2s)]
*  were the funders behind the terrorist [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1191.44s)]
*  who carried out October 7th. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1194.72s)]
*  My hope is on January 20th in two days, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1196.12s)]
*  the oil sanctions are enforced again, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1199.96s)]
*  and I want to see Iranian oil exports plummet again [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1201.8s)]
*  to ideally below 300,000 so that we starve the snake [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1205.36s)]
*  and cut off the head of the snake. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1209.52s)]
*  We both know that one of the core tensions [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1210.6799999999998s)]
*  in the new big MAGA tent, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1212.9199999999998s)]
*  which has lots of competing interests, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1215.4799999999998s)]
*  are the isolationists and the hawks. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1217.6s)]
*  You are definitely one of the hawks. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1220.6s)]
*  But the isolationists seem to have increasing power [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1222.78s)]
*  in this new administration. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1226.12s)]
*  I think Trump 2.0 and foreign policy [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1227.36s)]
*  could look very different than Trump 1.0. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1229.12s)]
*  If you give 30 days in your prediction for the airlines [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1231.38s)]
*  to make a turnaround when it comes to Israel, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1239.42s)]
*  what would your prediction be on this administration [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1241.42s)]
*  actually taking action vis-a-vis Iran? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1244.9s)]
*  Not its proxies, but Iran and its nuclear facilities. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1247.6200000000001s)]
*  So let me suggest a tweak on how you characterize it, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1251.1000000000001s)]
*  because I actually view foreign policy [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1253.98s)]
*  a little bit differently, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1257.0800000000002s)]
*  and my own views are a little bit different. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1257.94s)]
*  For a long time, people have viewed [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1260.66s)]
*  Republican foreign policy with really two poles, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1263.5s)]
*  the interventionists and the isolationists. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1266.46s)]
*  The interventionists- [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1270.3000000000002s)]
*  But now there's the fusionism, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1271.14s)]
*  and it's the American first foreign policy. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1273.02s)]
*  Well, and look, let me lay out my view first, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1275.26s)]
*  and then let me try to tie it to Trump's foreign policy. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1278.5800000000002s)]
*  I think both the interventionists and isolationists are wrong. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1282.7s)]
*  I think the interventionists have never seen a country [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1285.98s)]
*  they didn't want to invade. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1287.8600000000001s)]
*  I think the isolationists are unwilling to defend America [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1288.9s)]
*  from very real enemies that threaten us. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1292.1000000000001s)]
*  I've long viewed my perspective [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1295.5400000000002s)]
*  as a third point on the triangle, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1298.0600000000002s)]
*  and I call myself a non-interventionist hawk. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1300.1000000000001s)]
*  Now, what does that mean? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1304.9s)]
*  What that means is that I think the touchstone [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1306.46s)]
*  of American foreign policy [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1309.26s)]
*  should be the vital national security interest [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1310.96s)]
*  of the United States, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1313.2800000000002s)]
*  that we should not be in the business [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  of being the world's policeman. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1317.18s)]
*  We should not be in the business [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1319.58s)]
*  of invading foreign countries [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1321.22s)]
*  and trying to turn them into Switzerland, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1322.54s)]
*  democratic utopia. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1324.42s)]
*  So for example, I think the Iraq war was a mistake. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1325.66s)]
*  I think toppling Saddam Hussein made America less safe, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1329.46s)]
*  and we have a pattern of interventionists [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1333.38s)]
*  wanting to go in, toppling leaders [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1335.26s)]
*  who are fighting terrorists [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1338.42s)]
*  and ending up handing the country over [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1339.7s)]
*  to the terrorists who want to kill Americans. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1341.14s)]
*  I'm not interested in empowering terrorists [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1342.78s)]
*  who want to kill Americans. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1345.22s)]
*  That we should be, I believe, in peace through strength. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1347.5800000000002s)]
*  It's worth noting in eight years as president, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1350.98s)]
*  the biggest country Ronald Reagan ever invaded [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1354.5s)]
*  was Grenada, that if you're strong enough, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1357.6000000000001s)]
*  your enemies don't want to screw with you. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1360.52s)]
*  It's worth noting, Donald Trump didn't invade anyone. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1362.0600000000002s)]
*  But, and this is where the isolationists get it wrong, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1365.38s)]
*  there is a debate right now, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1368.1000000000001s)]
*  what does America First mean? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1369.24s)]
*  And everyone's trying to imprint [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1370.5800000000002s)]
*  their own view of the world on America First. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1372.18s)]
*  Those who are isolationists are trying to say [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1375.18s)]
*  America First means we withdraw from the world [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1377.3s)]
*  and don't lead. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1379.3s)]
*  I don't think that's right, and I can tell you [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1381.02s)]
*  that was not Donald Trump's philosophy [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1382.48s)]
*  when he was president. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1384.5800000000002s)]
*  ISIS, when Trump became president, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1385.46s)]
*  we were at war with ISIS, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1388.14s)]
*  and Trump utterly and completely defeated ISIS [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1389.46s)]
*  and took every square inch of their caliphate. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1391.94s)]
*  He was not an isolationist on ISIS, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1394.26s)]
*  he defeated our enemies because they wanted to kill us. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1396.14s)]
*  And by the way, General Soleimani, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1398.66s)]
*  Trump ordered the strike that took out General Soleimani. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1400.3600000000001s)]
*  That was exactly right, and then I introduced [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1403.96s)]
*  a resolution in the Senate that passed overwhelmingly [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1405.8400000000001s)]
*  praising that decision as a national security decision. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1409.06s)]
*  At the same time, he was not interested [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1411.8s)]
*  in meshing us in protracted foreign wars. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1414.8400000000001s)]
*  I think that's where the American people are. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1419.48s)]
*  And so, I think it's a mistake to view it simply [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1421.1200000000001s)]
*  as a battle between isolationism and interventionism. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1426.3600000000001s)]
*  I think most Americans, I think President Trump, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1429.7s)]
*  his foreign policy in the first term was very consonant [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1432.88s)]
*  with how I view foreign policy as a non-interventionist hawk, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1436.8000000000002s)]
*  and I think that was also Reagan's foreign policy. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1440.8600000000001s)]
*  A second term, we shall see, and I agree, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1444.0800000000002s)]
*  those debates are going to be live. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1446.44s)]
*  I cannot promise which sides will prevail in them. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1449.0600000000002s)]
*  I can promise that I'm gonna be actively engaged [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1452.42s)]
*  to say, number one, I don't wanna send our sons and daughters [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1455.8400000000001s)]
*  in harm's way in pursuit of abstract norms [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1458.3000000000002s)]
*  and international norms, but number two, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1461.48s)]
*  we should also not shy away from defending America, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1464.56s)]
*  and that means, if necessary, killing the enemies [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1467.4s)]
*  of America before they kill us. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1469.48s)]
*  One place where there's a lot of ambiguity, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1471.76s)]
*  and a lot of, it's not clear exactly where Trump will land, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1474.84s)]
*  or the White House will land, is on the question of China. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1480.48s)]
*  Big tech is hugely enmeshed in China. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1483.88s)]
*  I'm thinking of companies that rely [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1487.16s)]
*  on what is effectively slave labor, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1489.6s)]
*  chip manufacturers, EV batteries, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1491.7199999999998s)]
*  and you've got a bunch of people, we know their names, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1493.6799999999998s)]
*  swarming Mar-a-Lago, who saw which way the political [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1496.24s)]
*  and cultural winds were blowing, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1499.56s)]
*  threw off their pink pussy hats, put on their MAGA hats, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1501.32s)]
*  and threw in their lots with Trump, right? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1505.04s)]
*  And they desperately need China [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1507.28s)]
*  in order to advance their business interests. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1510.04s)]
*  How do you deal with that? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1512.3999999999999s)]
*  Do you worry about the national security implications [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1513.36s)]
*  of having people deeply enmeshed in the new White House, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1516.48s)]
*  or at least in Trump's orbit, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1520.6s)]
*  that also have a different interest they're trying to serve, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1522.28s)]
*  which is their business, and their business in China? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1525.14s)]
*  Look, I worry about every decision [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1528.04s)]
*  over the next four years, and it will be, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1530.88s)]
*  we need to be engaged and involved. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1532.92s)]
*  I spent the first term of Trump every day [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1534.78s)]
*  trying to urge the president to do good things, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1537.4s)]
*  trying to discourage him from doing bad things, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1539.3600000000001s)]
*  and that process, that's how the democratic process [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1541.04s)]
*  is supposed to work. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1543.28s)]
*  That's one of the most important roles of a senator, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1544.16s)]
*  is when Trump was president the first time, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1547.8000000000002s)]
*  I was by far his strongest ally in the Senate. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1550.4s)]
*  And when I fight for someone, I don't have a medium speed. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1553.44s)]
*  I fight ferociously. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1557.4s)]
*  It's the only way I know how to do it. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1558.72s)]
*  I will tell you, by the way, that there [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1561.2s)]
*  was a poll a few years back in Florida [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1562.92s)]
*  that showed 28% of Floridians believed [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1564.72s)]
*  I was the Zodiac Killer, which given that the murders happened [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1567.96s)]
*  before I was born, I'm actually pretty impressed. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1572.1s)]
*  To have that reach in utero is pretty impressive. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1574.62s)]
*  What a strange world we live in. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1581.5s)]
*  Look, when it comes to China, I have long believed, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1584.6599999999999s)]
*  and when I arrived in the Senate 13 years ago, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1590.6599999999999s)]
*  what I articulated then is that Communist China poses [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1593.06s)]
*  the single greatest geopolitical threat to the United States [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1598.06s)]
*  over the next 100 years. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1600.86s)]
*  Now, I'll tell you, when I got there, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1602.86s)]
*  that was a very lonely position. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1604.82s)]
*  There was almost nobody in Washington saying that. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1606.5s)]
*  Every Democrat disagreed with me, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1609.4599999999998s)]
*  and most Republicans disagreed with me. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1611.26s)]
*  They looked at China, and they saw nothing but dollar signs [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1612.9799999999998s)]
*  as far as the eye could see. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1616.58s)]
*  So that's not a new sentiment for the business world [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1618.86s)]
*  to look at China and see a profit. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1622.06s)]
*  Listen, as you know, my father was born and grew up in Cuba. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1626.02s)]
*  He fought in the Cuban Revolution. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1629.2199999999998s)]
*  He was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1630.7s)]
*  I know where you stand on this issue. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1633.42s)]
*  I'm asking you to comment on the ways in which the new MAGA [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1635.38s)]
*  wing of the party, right? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1639.82s)]
*  We all know who these people are. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1642.98s)]
*  In which ways you think that they're [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1645.54s)]
*  going to curry favor with Trump, influence Trump? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1647.06s)]
*  He seems to listen to them quite a lot. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1650.18s)]
*  I think it is going to be a major and ongoing dialogue [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1652.5s)]
*  and battle, and I intend to be closely involved [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1656.02s)]
*  in that dialogue, making the case for standing up [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1658.74s)]
*  to our enemies. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1662.58s)]
*  And I think dealing with China, so I've [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1663.3s)]
*  spent 13 years laying out, I think [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1665.26s)]
*  we need a comprehensive strategy to deal with China reminiscent [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1668.02s)]
*  of the strategy Reagan laid out to defeat the Soviet Union, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1671.94s)]
*  a comprehensive strategy. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1674.9s)]
*  Now, to be clear, Reagan never went to war with the Soviet [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1676.3s)]
*  Union. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1680.02s)]
*  No one in their right mind wants a shooting war [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1680.54s)]
*  between the United States and China. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1682.86s)]
*  That would be spectacularly stupid. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1684.28s)]
*  Both nations can obliterate every human being [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1686.42s)]
*  on planet Earth. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1689.66s)]
*  So we don't want that outcome. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1690.38s)]
*  But we have a host of tools to press back on China [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1692.22s)]
*  that include diplomatic tools. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1695.9s)]
*  They include tariffs. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1697.6200000000001s)]
*  They include economic pressure. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1699.38s)]
*  They include sunlight. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1701.0600000000002s)]
*  China engages systematically in espionage. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1702.9s)]
*  They engage in propaganda. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1705.74s)]
*  We have over 1 million Uighurs living in concentration camps [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1707.74s)]
*  and slavery. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1711.66s)]
*  They engage in murder and torture. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1712.3200000000002s)]
*  They have enormous culpability for COVID, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1714.5s)]
*  I think both the development of the COVID virus [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1717.1s)]
*  and suppressing knowledge about it as the pandemic began [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1719.86s)]
*  to spread. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1724.5s)]
*  And so I can tell you, for 13 years, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1725.02s)]
*  I have systematically laid out legislative steps [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1727.66s)]
*  to press back. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1730.98s)]
*  When it comes to TikTok, I strongly [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1731.94s)]
*  support the legislation Congress passed. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1734.58s)]
*  Why? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1736.58s)]
*  Not to ban TikTok. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1737.58s)]
*  I don't want to ban TikTok. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1738.86s)]
*  I want to force China to divest and to end [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1740.34s)]
*  any control or ownership of TikTok [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1743.98s)]
*  by the Chinese communist government. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1746.82s)]
*  Well, the Supreme Court agrees with you. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1749.3s)]
*  Yes, unanimously. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1751.1s)]
*  And that is going into effect tomorrow. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1753.02s)]
*  Well, maybe. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1755.86s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1756.78s)]
*  Donald Trump, the news just broke a few hours ago, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1758.1799999999998s)]
*  that he's talking about giving TikTok a 90-day reprieve [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1761.26s)]
*  from this ban. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1764.34s)]
*  I'm confused. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1765.6599999999999s)]
*  This is the law. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1767.06s)]
*  What am I missing? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1768.58s)]
*  Look, I will say the statute gives the president the authority [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1769.5s)]
*  to have a 90-day reprieve. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1772.62s)]
*  That is written into the statute. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1773.98s)]
*  The objective is to force a sale of TikTok. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1776.06s)]
*  I will say TikTok arrogantly. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1778.98s)]
*  They have had almost 300 days to do so. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1781.62s)]
*  And they've spent their time on lawfare and lobbying. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1784.42s)]
*  Yes, they have. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1786.94s)]
*  And they have been lobbying like crazy. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1787.78s)]
*  They have been fighting like crazy. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1789.5s)]
*  They have not pursued a sale. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1791.66s)]
*  Look. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1794.78s)]
*  But if TikTok is a national security threat, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1795.26s)]
*  how can that national security concern be waived for 90 days? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1797.94s)]
*  Because the statute provides that it can be waived for 90 days. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1802.66s)]
*  And the statute provides it can be waived for 90 days [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1805.74s)]
*  in order to facilitate a sale. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1807.98s)]
*  If the outcome is that China divests and gives up its control, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1810.1000000000001s)]
*  that's a good outcome. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1814.8200000000002s)]
*  So I don't know what Trump is or isn't going to do on this. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1816.38s)]
*  If we are sitting here 91 days from now, and TikTok is still live, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1819.5400000000002s)]
*  and China is still owning and controlling it, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1824.7800000000002s)]
*  that will be a very dangerous situation. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1827.78s)]
*  Because the Chinese communist government uses TikTok, number one, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1829.66s)]
*  for espionage, and number two, to push propaganda [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1832.9s)]
*  and to push very harmful content to our children, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1835.7s)]
*  harmful content that pushes self-harm, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1839.18s)]
*  that pushes suicidal ideation, that pushes substance abuse, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1843.22s)]
*  that pushes anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism and anti-capitalism. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1847.86s)]
*  It is a potent propaganda tool. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1853.1s)]
*  And listen, when it comes to holding Big Tech accountable, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1855.34s)]
*  there has not been anyone in the United States Senate [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1859.7s)]
*  who has been more vigorous. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1862.22s)]
*  And I can promise you, as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1863.3799999999999s)]
*  we are going to be engaged in a very serious way [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1866.54s)]
*  on Big Tech's censorship and the harmful content they have pushed. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1869.62s)]
*  So if we're 91 days from now, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1873.58s)]
*  and China no longer owns and controls TikTok, that's a victory. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1877.5s)]
*  If we're 91 days from now, and they continue to push the garbage, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1880.8999999999999s)]
*  that will be a serious failure. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1884.18s)]
*  Do you think there's actually a plausible buyer? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1885.42s)]
*  I know Kevin O'Leary and Frank McCord are going around saying they're going to buy it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1888.66s)]
*  Look, I don't know, and I'm relatively agnostic on who the buyer is, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1892.22s)]
*  as long as they're not a communist government [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1896.5800000000002s)]
*  that is our enemy and seeks to do us harm. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1900.22s)]
*  By the way, the Chinese variant of TikTok, for their kids, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1902.5400000000002s)]
*  number one, the hours they can use it are limited, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1909.3400000000001s)]
*  and number two, they're pushing videos that are things like math and hard work and discipline. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1911.54s)]
*  Oh, it's like Khan Academy. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1914.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it really is astonishingly harmful. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1916.78s)]
*  So their kids are studying calculus and our kids are being told to chew Tide Pods. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1921.14s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1926.46s)]
*  This is one of the rare... [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1929.14s)]
*  And kids don't chew Tide Pods. Those are bad for you. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1930.42s)]
*  This is one of the rare instances where the ACLU [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1932.9s)]
*  and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression sees eye to eye. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1935.86s)]
*  They're arguing that it's a free speech issue and that concerns over national security [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1939.7s)]
*  are insufficient as an argument to sort of infringe on America's right to free expression on the platform. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1944.1000000000001s)]
*  170 million Americans use this. What do you make of the free speech argument? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1949.22s)]
*  Well, that argument won precisely zero votes at the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1953.3400000000001s)]
*  And that's unsurprising. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1957.38s)]
*  It is not because at the end of the day, this law passed by Congress is not seeking to suppress free speech. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1960.5400000000002s)]
*  Which I understand, by the way, the First Amendment only applies to Americans. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1967.02s)]
*  There's nothing in the First Amendment that applies to foreign nations [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1970.1s)]
*  engaging in espionage and propaganda in the United States. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1974.46s)]
*  The law passed by Congress is not seeking to silence any American. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1979.66s)]
*  Look, I'm a free speech absolutist and I've spent a lot of time and energy [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1982.9s)]
*  actually defending the right of people to call me a son of a bitch or the Zodiac killer. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1988.06s)]
*  OK, I do have to do... [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1993.54s)]
*  You really love the Zodiac killer. Yeah, go on, please. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1994.14s)]
*  I do have to do a quick aside. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1995.86s)]
*  So day after tomorrow, our new Secretary of State will be Marco Rubio, a good friend of mine. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=1997.1799999999998s)]
*  I will tell you, Marco, Marco has a great sense of humor. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2003.54s)]
*  And back in 2016, when Trump accused my father of helping to kill JFK, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2007.98s)]
*  Marco stood up at one of the Senate Republican lunches and he said, listen, I need to tell everyone here. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2016.74s)]
*  I know for a fact Ted's dad did not kill JFK. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2023.18s)]
*  And Marco said, look, because if a Cuban had done that, he would have told everyone. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2028.78s)]
*  There's a lot of truth to that. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2035.66s)]
*  Who did kill JFK? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2036.66s)]
*  I don't know, but I'd love to see it. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2038.78s)]
*  Look, I talked with John Ratcliffe, about to be the new CIA director, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2041.54s)]
*  and I said, declassify all the information, accept stuff about my dad, keep that hidden, but everything else. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2044.78s)]
*  Look, I'm... [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2050.46s)]
*  Why hasn't that been unsealed yet? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2052.1s)]
*  I think it should be. I'm completely on board. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2053.82s)]
*  By the way, I also want to see the client list for Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2055.94s)]
*  I think that should be public. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2061.14s)]
*  I think it's absolutely grotesque. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2062.42s)]
*  And we need transparency is powerful. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2065.26s)]
*  And I also want to see the same information for P. Diddy. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2069.42s)]
*  Like if you have a bunch of celebrities who are engaged in sexual assault and child rape. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2075.02s)]
*  By the way, Free Press, your coverage of what is happening in the United Kingdom [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2080.54s)]
*  and the horrific, the decades of child rape there is incredibly important. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2084.9s)]
*  As you know, I do a podcast every week. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2090.42s)]
*  It's called Verdict with Ted Cruz. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2092.7400000000002s)]
*  We do it three days a week. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2094.1s)]
*  I did an entire podcast devoted to your coverage of the child rape scandal and also tying it to... [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2096.42s)]
*  You look at thousands of children systematically raped in the United Kingdom. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2103.42s)]
*  Politicians, both conservative and labor, who turned a blind eye because of multiculturalism. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2107.58s)]
*  They did not want to call out the predominantly Pakistani Muslim men who were engaged in horrific crimes. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2113.34s)]
*  There needs to be accountability there. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2124.1s)]
*  But I also pointed out for the Americans who are saying, well, gosh, we'd never do such a thing here. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2126.34s)]
*  It is worth focusing on the number 300,000 because 300,000 is the number of children that the Biden-Harris administration has lost. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2133.86s)]
*  In the last four years, they are unaccompanied minors who came to this country or in federal government custody. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2142.6200000000003s)]
*  They were handed over to adults, many of whom were not relatives. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2148.06s)]
*  And now the Biden administration says we can't find them. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2151.26s)]
*  We know many of those kids are being abused sexually and otherwise. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2153.98s)]
*  I can tell you I have sat down with Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and RFK Jr., soon to be the HHS secretary. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2157.82s)]
*  Both of them, I've called upon them to create a task force and find every one of those children and those who are in harm's way, get them out of harm's way. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2165.98s)]
*  And so our hands are not exactly clean when it comes to looking the other way at children being mistreated. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2173.66s)]
*  Since you brought up Jeffrey Epstein, P. Diddy and the grooming gangs, I want to ask you sort of more generally about part of what I see is the vibe shift. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2180.62s)]
*  Right. And it goes like this. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2189.06s)]
*  The origins of the covid virus, the efficacy of vaccines, especially in kids, the lockdowns, the reality of what happened in the summer of 2020 with the BLM movement, where all that money went. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2191.9s)]
*  People have a sense that the elites have been lying to them in this country and that the institutions and that the institutions, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2203.3399999999997s)]
*  they once trusted, can no longer be trusted. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2210.26s)]
*  And it's sent us into this really strange liminal place where people are kind of doing their own research and they're much more open to things that were regarded as conspiracies, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2213.26s)]
*  maybe still are conspiracy theories. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2224.5800000000004s)]
*  And I kind of wanted to run through a few of them with you. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2226.5s)]
*  The drones over New Jersey. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2229.46s)]
*  What are those? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2230.78s)]
*  Damn defy now. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2231.94s)]
*  And I will say I'm frustrated because I haven't gotten a good answer on that. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2233.3s)]
*  But you're right, because we've seen government institutions lie to us so much. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2236.86s)]
*  People have a much greater skepticism and they don't believe the answers they get from the executive branch when they lay it out. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2242.1s)]
*  A good example of this, I think, is the I've tried to ask and I can't get a good answer. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2248.38s)]
*  The lack of efficacy for the covid vaccines have led to a broader. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2253.26s)]
*  How do I say this diplomatically? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2258.86s)]
*  A reassessment of vaccines in general. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2260.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2263.02s)]
*  What do you think about the fact that something that's been pretty well discredited, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2264.02s)]
*  the idea that vaccines cause autism is now not just seeing a revival, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2268.22s)]
*  but arguably one of the people that has been supportive broadly of that view might become the HHS HHS secretary. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2273.26s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2281.14s)]
*  Well, look, I think on questions like this, the world need not be binary. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2282.22s)]
*  It need not be an ideological decision that that leaves only one of two camps. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2287.62s)]
*  Either all vaccines are who we and I don't do any of them or every vaccine is wonderful and a gift from God. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2293.06s)]
*  And you must vaccinate no matter what. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2299.9s)]
*  Like there is a place for reasonable people to say, well, let's engage in a cost benefit analysis. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2301.42s)]
*  Let's consider evidence. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2307.06s)]
*  I can tell you, for example, the arguments we saw from from the government, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2308.7s)]
*  from the Biden administration, from from the corporate media about the covid vaccine, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2313.5s)]
*  particularly the covid vaccine with children made no sense because the cost benefit analysis, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2318.62s)]
*  if you're 85 years old in the middle of covid, it was a perfectly reasonable decision to say, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2324.22s)]
*  I'm going to take the covid vaccine because the harms, particularly for older Americans, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2329.7s)]
*  were significant enough that, yes, are there risks to a new and untested vaccine? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2334.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes. But you could make a reasonable personal cost benefit analysis and decide to take it. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2338.8199999999997s)]
*  At the same time, if you have a four year old child, the risk of covid were nominal. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2344.34s)]
*  Yeah. And the risks of an untested vaccine for the child were very different. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2349.98s)]
*  And people treated it as this is a virtue signal. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2354.6600000000003s)]
*  This is I worry about the tribalism of our country, that you're you're on one team or the other. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2358.5800000000004s)]
*  Your shirts or skins and whatever my team says. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2363.5s)]
*  All vaccines are great. All vaccines are horrible. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2366.2200000000003s)]
*  How about in a reasonable sense? Let's assess. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2368.26s)]
*  Look, I mean, I'm very glad to have had the polio vaccine. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2371.3s)]
*  Glad we don't have polio. That's that's a good thing. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2374.34s)]
*  I don't think it's crazy. Look, I just spent an hour with Bobby Kennedy in my office. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2377.14s)]
*  He's a very smart man. And I think asking questions about, for example, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2382.82s)]
*  the incidence of autism in society, the incidence of diabetes in society, the shifts that have occurred. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2387.98s)]
*  I don't think that's unreasonable to ask. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2394.86s)]
*  OK, what changed to see dramatic spikes in in food allergies that our kids are facing [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2396.86s)]
*  that that a few decades ago didn't exist? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2404.5s)]
*  I don't think we should treat science. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2409.3s)]
*  All right. So so the last book I wrote is entitled Unwoke, How to Defeat Cultural Marxism in America. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2412.34s)]
*  By the way, I quote you at length in the book, Unwoke. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2417.94s)]
*  Should I be flattered? You should look at it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2422.1000000000004s)]
*  It is I focus on each major institution in America that has been captured by the radical left. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2424.5s)]
*  I start with colleges and universities. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2431.82s)]
*  And then there are many chapters on The New York Times. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2434.18s)]
*  There is an entire chapter on journalism where I quote your resignation letter at length. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2436.5s)]
*  And I have said this, it should be required reading in every school of journalism. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2442.1s)]
*  And it is it is an incredibly important indictment of sadly what is probably the most important journalistic entity in the world. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2446.94s)]
*  And it is profoundly corrupt and broken. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2457.1s)]
*  And I think The New York Times is an utter piece of garbage that does enormous harm to the world. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2459.02s)]
*  I did also say on the campaign trail frequently, if The New York Times is ever praising me, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2464.3s)]
*  I've gone cataclysmically wrong and I should resign that day. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2468.78s)]
*  Thankfully, I'm not holding my breath to that. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2472.9s)]
*  But it's also led to amazing things like the decline of the decline of the old has led to the rise of amazing new things. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2474.86s)]
*  The problem is, is that that's relevant in areas like journalism or universities. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2480.94s)]
*  I'm on the board of a new university that just started recently. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2487.06s)]
*  It University of Austin, which is it is a phenomenal. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2489.94s)]
*  So that's great. But we can't have like an alternative to the Justice Department. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2493.3s)]
*  We can't have an alternative to the CDC. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2497.1400000000003s)]
*  We have to have public trust in these places. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2499.6200000000003s)]
*  How do we rebuild that? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2503.66s)]
*  So we get connected to the rise of conspiracy minded thinking. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2505.62s)]
*  Yes. And it's because so many things that were true. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2510.02s)]
*  No, so many things that were that they told us were conspiracy theories turned out to be true or directionally true. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2513.74s)]
*  Yes. So so look, let's see. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2519.66s)]
*  You might say or even more than that. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2523.22s)]
*  Let's take the origins of the covid virus. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2525.3799999999997s)]
*  So on my podcast verdict in March of twenty twenty one, I did one in March and one in April of twenty twenty one, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2528.54s)]
*  laying out the evidence then that covid originated from a Chinese government lab in Wuhan, China. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2536.78s)]
*  And I thought the evidence was compelling then at that time, that was a tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theory. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2542.5s)]
*  At that time, you could be blocked on social media at that time. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2550.74s)]
*  Facebook and Twitter were pulling down anyone who said that because Dr. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2554.46s)]
*  Fauci was asking them to do that, to silence that view. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2558.9s)]
*  That view now is widely accepted and multiple agencies of the federal government now concluded is right. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2561.9s)]
*  The facts were evident then, but we were lied to. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2569.2200000000003s)]
*  We've seen pattern after pattern after pattern of lies. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2573.06s)]
*  And so people naturally, when institutions lie to you over and over again, rational people stop believing those institutions. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2576.1800000000003s)]
*  So when it comes to science, when it comes to the CDC. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2583.22s)]
*  Look, I worry about the CDC losing credibility because, God forbid, we have some horrible disease, Ebola breakout. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2588.4599999999996s)]
*  Nobody wants like all of our kids to die from some, whether it's a bio weapon or something naturally. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2594.58s)]
*  You want people to trust medical professionals. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2600.3399999999997s)]
*  But I think Dr. Fauci did enormous damage to the credibility of science. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2602.62s)]
*  My book on woke has a whole chapter on science. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2609.4199999999996s)]
*  And it's because it became politicized. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2612.18s)]
*  Science should be driven by data and not. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2614.94s)]
*  The use of government power to force an outcome. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2619.8599999999997s)]
*  And so your answer, how do we restore trust in these institutions? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2622.98s)]
*  I think the answer is make them trustworthy. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2627.46s)]
*  And do you think J Bhattacharya, Marty Macarey, Bobby Kennedy are the right people to do that? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2628.94s)]
*  I hope so. Look, I like that they're willing. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2633.02s)]
*  To number one, challenge conventional wisdom. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2637.18s)]
*  Number two, when it comes to let's take HHS and the FDA, I think there is enormous corruption. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2639.22s)]
*  For example, giant pharmaceutical companies that get in bed with the FDA and use government power, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2644.98s)]
*  number one, to enforce their monopolies. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2650.9s)]
*  Number two, to stop innovation. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2652.82s)]
*  And so, for example, I've written legislation called the Results Act that says that any [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2655.06s)]
*  pharmaceutical or medical device that is approved in another major developed country, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2664.42s)]
*  so Canada, Japan, the EU, the FDA has 60 days to approve it here because it's you ever watch the movie Dallas Buyers Club? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2668.5s)]
*  Yes. Fabulous movie. I know Matthew McConaughey a little bit. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2676.98s)]
*  I've seen it. He's incredibly won an Oscar for it. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2680.98s)]
*  He deserved an Oscar. But I've actually talked with Matthew about it and said, look, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2684.02s)]
*  that was a profoundly conservative movie because it is a movie about oppressive [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2688.1000000000004s)]
*  government regulations preventing people who are facing a deadly disease from getting life-saving [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2693.7s)]
*  medications and as a result had to go down to Mexico to get the medications they needed to stay alive. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2699.7s)]
*  I'm actually really excited about Bobby Kennedy being willing to take on the cronyism. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2705.8599999999997s)]
*  Listen, big business loves big government. Big business gets in bed with big government [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2712.8199999999997s)]
*  and they entrench their power at the expense of consumers. So I'm excited about that. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2716.74s)]
*  Now, if we end up in a world where there are no vaccines and everyone has polio, that would [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2722.1s)]
*  really suck. I don't support that world. But I don't think we have to be all or nothing. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2726.3399999999997s)]
*  I think we ought to be driven by actual facts and be open to contrary theories. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2732.74s)]
*  Dr. Fauci said at one point, I am the science. That sounds like Magneto. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2741.94s)]
*  Like that's not...and to be clear, the essence of science is the scientific method is being [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2749.7s)]
*  willing to challenge...you know, there was a time when we were told the universe revolves [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2756.7400000000002s)]
*  around the earth. And then scientists challenged that concept. That's the whole heart of science. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2762.98s)]
*  I have absolute certainty that things we are told are proven scientific facts today. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2768.42s)]
*  50 years from now, we will know are false. I don't know which ones, but I want science [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2774.9s)]
*  to challenge all the assumptions because that's how science is meant to operate. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2779.46s)]
*  Half of the people in this country, when they hear the phrase deep state, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2783.46s)]
*  think that's a conspiracy theory. You think the deep state is real. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2786.58s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2789.94s)]
*  Give us a minute on...prove to me in a minute, we're on an elevator, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2790.98s)]
*  that the deep state's real in one minute. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2795.38s)]
*  All right. So another book I wrote is called Justice Corrupted, How the Left [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2798.9s)]
*  Has Weaponized Our Legal System. It starts off telling the story of Richard Nixon in [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2802.26s)]
*  Watergate. And by the way, I'm not a Richard Nixon fan. I think the guy was utterly a crook. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2807.2200000000003s)]
*  And he tried to weaponize the machinery of government against his political enemies. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2811.78s)]
*  And at the time, the system fought back. And it didn't work. But then Barack Obama came in, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2817.0600000000004s)]
*  decades later, and what Richard Nixon tried to do, Obama succeeded in doing, which is [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2824.1000000000004s)]
*  systematically weaponizing the federal government to attack their enemies. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2829.14s)]
*  What happened after Obama is you had hardcore partisans who burrowed into career positions [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2833.46s)]
*  within the federal government. And when Trump became president, they waged war on Donald Trump [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2841.8599999999997s)]
*  from within the government. That is the deep state. And you look at right from the beginning, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2847.54s)]
*  for example, the entire Russia investigation, which was based on a fraudulent [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2854.98s)]
*  oppo research dossier paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2859.7s)]
*  It was an effort to wage a coup on the democratically elected president of the United [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2864.66s)]
*  States because they disagreed with his policies and they were arrogant enough to believe they [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2869.46s)]
*  had the power to decide. And then when Joe Biden became president, those partisans came out in the [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2874.82s)]
*  open. I believe Merrick Garland has been the most partisan attorney general this nation has ever [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2881.62s)]
*  seen. I think the most important role for Pam Bondi is to restore integrity to the Department [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2886.98s)]
*  of Justice and to turn around the weaponization that is open and brazen. Look, Merrick Garland [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2891.7799999999997s)]
*  wrote a memo to the FBI directing the FBI, go after parents who go to school boards and [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2899.94s)]
*  dare to speak up at school boards, treat them essentially as domestic terrorists. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2906.66s)]
*  I remember. Because they're political enemies of this country. You look at, for example, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2911.62s)]
*  pro-life protesters. Now you may be pro-life, you may be pro-choice. Well, you know what? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2916.8199999999997s)]
*  Pro-life protesters. You look at Mark Hauk, who was a pro-life protester at an abortion clinic. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2921.7s)]
*  Someone began screaming at his 12-year-old son, getting in his face. Mark Hauk pushed the guy back [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2927.54s)]
*  for screaming at his 12-year-old son. What happened? Merrick Garland and the FBI sent [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2932.02s)]
*  a dozen storm troopers with machine guns to arrest Mark Hauk at the crack of dawn in front [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2937.62s)]
*  of his seven screaming children. They treated him like he was Osama Bin Laden, arrested him, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2943.62s)]
*  prosecuted him. By the way, the jury, when they presented the evidence, the jury threw the case [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2951.38s)]
*  out in minutes because I'm sorry, shoving a guy who's screaming at your child, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2955.2200000000003s)]
*  your child is not a federal criminal offense. This pattern is systematic over and over again. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2960.18s)]
*  You look at the FBI. I don't know that there's an institution in America that has lost more respect [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2969.46s)]
*  than the FBI has because it has been used and willingly used in a blatantly partisan [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2975.7799999999997s)]
*  and political way. Look, I think it is a huge obligation of this new administration. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2982.4199999999996s)]
*  Are you suggesting that we have a kind of two-tiered justice system? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2986.8199999999997s)]
*  One for conservatives, one for liberals? Unquestionably so. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2989.86s)]
*  This administration and weaponization has all sorts of components to it. One component of [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=2995.0600000000004s)]
*  weaponization is using government to target your political enemy. So in more than two centuries of [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3000.9s)]
*  our nation's history, we have never previously indicted a president or former president. We've [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3007.0600000000004s)]
*  never prosecuted a president or former president. In the last two years, Democrat prosecutors have [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3011.86s)]
*  indicted and prosecuted Donald Trump not once, not twice, not three times, but four separate times. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3017.94s)]
*  All of those cases were about fundamentally, they weren't even about Trump, they were about [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3023.94s)]
*  stopping the voters from doing what they did in November anyway, which is re-electing him. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3028.02s)]
*  That is an incredible abuse of power. It also is about protecting your political friends and allies [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3032.7400000000002s)]
*  and I think we've seen the Department of Justice behave as Joe Biden's protectors in a way that is [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3039.38s)]
*  profoundly dangerous. Weaponization is also about disregarding the law. So let's take, for example, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3044.42s)]
*  our open borders. What Joe Biden has done on illegal immigration is qualitatively different [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3051.14s)]
*  from any other president in the history of this country. I've joked a number of times, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3058.7400000000002s)]
*  Biden did something I used to think was impossible. He made me miss Barack Obama. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3064.58s)]
*  Look, Obama, I disagreed with all sorts of policies he put in place, but on immigration, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3069.78s)]
*  Obama by and large followed the law. Obama deported millions of people. If you remember, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3075.6200000000003s)]
*  the left got very mad at Obama. They called him the deporter in chief. What Joe Biden has done, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3080.5800000000004s)]
*  no president has ever done before, which is millions of people that were apprehended, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3085.6200000000003s)]
*  he simply let them go. And federal law, the statutes are explicit. You shall detain them, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3089.3s)]
*  you shall deport them. That is federal statute. And frankly, our constitution is not designed [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3095.78s)]
*  to deal with a chief executive who utterly defies the law. That's an aspect of weaponization as [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3103.94s)]
*  well. The 12 million illegal immigrants who came into this country, I believe were deliberately [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3110.26s)]
*  allowed in this country because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and elected Democrats saw a political [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3115.2200000000003s)]
*  benefit to flooding illegal immigrants into this country. That's ultimately lawless. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3121.38s)]
*  And I think that was a major impetus behind Donald Trump being reelected. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3127.2200000000003s)]
*  So that's not a conspiracy. That's real. It's absolutely real. And this is where facts matter. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3130.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm a big believer in laying out the facts, laying out the evidence. And that's also the beauty of [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3136.26s)]
*  free speech. Look, you guys do a phenomenal job of laying out facts and evidence. One of the enormous [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3142.82s)]
*  problems with big tech censorship is it avoids getting to the truth. And when it comes to, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3151.22s)]
*  is there false speech? Yes. But I'm with John Stuart Mill, the best cure for bad speech is more [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3157.4599999999996s)]
*  speech. It's not censorship and silencing. So I recall, for example, sitting down in my office [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3163.9399999999996s)]
*  with the CEO of YouTube, and YouTube at the time was deplatforming conservatives. And at the time, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3170.5s)]
*  Steven Crowder had a show. Steven Crowder is a comedian. He can be raunchy sometimes. It's [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3179.14s)]
*  not unique among comedians. But he was in a fight with a journalist and they were getting mad at [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3184.34s)]
*  each other and insulting each other. And so YouTube decided to demonetize him. I remember the CEO [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3190.42s)]
*  sitting in my office. She said, look, you should feel glad because we were getting pressed from [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3195.62s)]
*  many people on the left to deplatform altogether just to block him. And she said, we didn't do that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3199.62s)]
*  We just demonetized him. And I started laughing. And I said, that's great. How would you like it [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3205.06s)]
*  if someone just demonetized you? Is that OK? Do you not want revenue from what you're doing? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3209.54s)]
*  Demonetizing is OK. And I said, let me be clear. The requests from censorship are only coming from [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3215.14s)]
*  one side. I'm not asking you to silence Bernie Sanders at AOC. I want everyone to hear the idiocy [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3220.42s)]
*  they're saying. It is only one side and it is the left that is saying use power to silence dissents. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3225.7s)]
*  The people that have been doing that over the past decade, all of a sudden they're turning around. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3233.2200000000003s)]
*  They're donating millions of dollars to the inauguration. They're throwing balls. They're [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3237.38s)]
*  all over this town this weekend. Are you annoyed by the opportunism of it? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3241.62s)]
*  No. There are two ways to defeat your enemies. You can kill them. I was trying to find a [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3245.46s)]
*  diplomatic way to say that. Eliminate. Or you can turn them into friends. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3253.78s)]
*  You have a lot of new friends right now. I will accept a change in conduct. So for example, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3258.02s)]
*  Metta. Metta has announced a whole... They got rid of the tampons in the men's restrooms. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3263.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm sure half their employees are in trouble now. It's truly astonishing. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3271.2999999999997s)]
*  I've had multiple discussions with people who said, do you think Zuckerberg has really [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3278.74s)]
*  changed his worldview? And to be honest, I said, I don't care. I'm not in the business of salvation. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3282.34s)]
*  I'm not in the business of judging his heart. I do care about actions. And I'm going to judge [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3289.94s)]
*  what Metta does by their actions. If they stop censoring speech, if they are a platform that [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3297.3s)]
*  allows free speech, I'm happy for it regardless of what desires are buried deep in their hearts. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3302.98s)]
*  And so my view, I'm willing to celebrate what Metta has announced because what they've announced [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3310.02s)]
*  is very good. But my view is also derived from Reagan, trust but verify. And I can promise you [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3315.06s)]
*  as chairman of the Commerce Committee, you're going to see hearings and examinations. And if [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3322.18s)]
*  they allow free speech, that's great. And I think Metta's change of heart is derived from two people, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3325.94s)]
*  Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Elon Musk buying Twitter was the single most important action [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3331.54s)]
*  for free speech in our lifetimes. It transformed the big tech playing field. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3337.7s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump would have won if he hadn't bought X? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3342.5s)]
*  He may not have. Look, I think Twitter has become the public square. And it is incredibly potent. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3345.54s)]
*  It is potent in fighting back the lies of the corporate media because it empowers, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3351.9399999999996s)]
*  there's a prominent journalist in Washington who was screaming at people on Twitter, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3359.9399999999996s)]
*  you are not the media. Look, I think it's a fabulous thing. I think podcasts are a fabulous [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3364.58s)]
*  thing. I think we are all like free speech, the democratization, everyone has a platform to speak. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3368.74s)]
*  Does that invite some chaos? Does that invite confusion? Sure. But I think it is a beautiful [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3376.66s)]
*  thing. And I want to see more and more of it. Okay, two minutes for a lightning round. And then [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3383.22s)]
*  I will let you go. Okay, the federal government, 55% of Columbia's budget comes from the federal [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3386.9s)]
*  government. Do you think that should change? Yes. And let me break it into two pieces. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3395.3s)]
*  This is a lightning round, Senator Chris. Look, it ought to change across the board, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3400.7400000000002s)]
*  but it ought to change most exquisitely when it deals with the anti-Semitic protests. And Title [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3404.1800000000003s)]
*  Six makes that illegal, by the way. Any democrat who says, gosh, things are just fine, ought to [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3408.42s)]
*  ask why under Joe Biden did not a single university lose their funding under Title Six? And the answer [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3415.06s)]
*  is the people funding the anti-Semitic protests are the same people who are funding the Democrat [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3421.14s)]
*  Party. I do believe one of the most significant shifts under Trump is DOJ is going to go after [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3425.7s)]
*  any university that looks the other way, that tolerates anti-Semitic threats of violence, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3430.5s)]
*  intimidation, and threats directed at Jewish students. And Columbia is right at the top of [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3436.34s)]
*  the worst offenders. And so if they don't change their conduct dramatically, I think you're going [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3441.3s)]
*  to see the Trump administration cut off their federal funds. You're a graduate of Princeton [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3446.42s)]
*  and Harvard Law. Are those institutions you would allow your children to attend? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3449.94s)]
*  It's a great question that I struggle with. And we've seen the elite academy. They are deeply [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3453.6200000000003s)]
*  messed up. I don't know. I'd like to win them back. I'd like to turn them around. Look, I learned a [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3458.98s)]
*  lot. They were great. Now, I have to admit, when I went there, you know, my father referred to my [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3465.0600000000004s)]
*  time at Princeton and Harvard as missionary work. I didn't learn what they wanted me to learn. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3469.86s)]
*  I was supposed to be indoctrinated. Now, I will say, when I was there, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3477.46s)]
*  they were not nearly as corrupted as they are now. I'm not sure I could survive in today's [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3483.2200000000003s)]
*  environment. But I'll also say, being the child of a Cuban immigrant who's been imprisoned and [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3487.86s)]
*  tortured, I hate communists. I think communism is the most evil ideology mankind has ever produced. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3494.58s)]
*  I remember when I was at Princeton, a guy down the hall from me in his dorm, he had a poster of [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3503.94s)]
*  Che Guevara on the wall. And I remember I went into his room. I said, hey, that's awesome. That's so [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3510.1s)]
*  cool. I said, have you thought of maybe putting Hitler next to it? Or maybe Stalin or Pol Pot? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3515.94s)]
*  If you're going to celebrate murdering, torturing evil bastards, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3521.7799999999997s)]
*  Che was an amateur. Hitler killed many more. Stalin, Mao, why are you focusing on the junior [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3527.06s)]
*  varsity? And he was utterly confused because the guy is rakishly good-looking, and so isn't it sexy [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3532.9s)]
*  that you murder people but you got a five o'clock shadow? Truth is powerful. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3540.18s)]
*  I want to take the universities back, and I think shining a light on what is happening there [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3545.62s)]
*  is important. And if you don't think that can happen, take a look at what happens to the [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3552.98s)]
*  presidents of Harvard and Penn, where their conduct was so indefensible that they've lost their jobs. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3557.06s)]
*  I think we ought to keep fighting to turn them around. I also think what you're doing, starting [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3565.14s)]
*  alternatives, hugely important, and that's part of how we take them back. Crypto-reality is [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3569.62s)]
*  huge right now. Amen. Real or a scam? I think real. I'm very bullish on Bitcoin. I own Bitcoin. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3575.54s)]
*  To the best of my knowledge, I am the only senator who is a Bitcoin miner. I have three miners in [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3583.62s)]
*  West Texas that are hashing right now. By the way, I was at the Crypto Ball last night, and it was [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3593.94s)]
*  pretty wild. Snoop Dogg was there, and so my 16-year-old daughter, who's not particularly [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3599.86s)]
*  into politics, she did think it was cool to come up and hang out with Snoop Dogg. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3605.2200000000003s)]
*  One word for the following. Pete Hegseth. One word. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3609.1400000000003s)]
*  Focused. JD Vance. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3614.98s)]
*  Talented. RFK. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3617.78s)]
*  Freethinker. Steve Bannon. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3621.2200000000003s)]
*  Revolutionary. Karen Bass. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3625.1400000000003s)]
*  Moron. Gavin Newsom. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3630.5800000000004s)]
*  Prettier moron. Beto O'Rourke. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3636.98s)]
*  Unemployed. Who would you rather be stuck on an elevator alone with for five hours? RFK, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3645.6200000000003s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, or Matt Gaetz? RFK, clearly. Will the Dallas Cowboys win another Super Bowl in our [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3652.5800000000004s)]
*  lifetimes? Absolutely. Who was the better president, Joe Biden or James Buchanan? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3658.9s)]
*  I know next to nothing about James Buchanan, but I'm going to say him. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3665.54s)]
*  Would you ever run for president again? Of course. Would you ever visit Cancun again? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3669.14s)]
*  Of course. If you started your rap career, what would your name be? And don't say Snoop Dogg. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3673.62s)]
*  You don't have a rap name? I don't have a rap name, damned if I know. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3680.34s)]
*  Do you have a stripper name? Not that I know of. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3683.3s)]
*  Who won the 2020 presidential election? Joe Biden. Is this a post-Christian country? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3685.94s)]
*  Where we are? That doesn't allow a yes or no. Is the U.S. ripe for a religious revival? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3694.82s)]
*  I'm a Christian. I believe in the redemptive power of faith and God's love. And I think much [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3706.02s)]
*  of where we are is because so many people have rejected faith. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3711.86s)]
*  You are a huge Simpsons fan. Who is the best character other than Homer? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3716.6600000000003s)]
*  Bart. Why? By the way, it's very interesting. The left feels that they own pop culture. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3722.98s)]
*  There are a few things you can do that drive them crazier than when you [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3731.06s)]
*  characterize pop culture in a way that is freedom enhancing. So at CPAC several years ago, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3738.26s)]
*  I explained to the Simpsons I thought was a profoundly conservative show. And I said, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3742.6600000000003s)]
*  look, if you look at it, Homer Simpson is every man. Homer Simpson is the prototypical Trump voter. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3747.7000000000003s)]
*  Marge Simpson is a caring homemaker who loves her kids. She's a Republican voter. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3753.78s)]
*  She's a maha mom before that was a thing? Yes. Yes. Bart is a young libertarian [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3759.06s)]
*  troublemaker. He's voting right. Maggie. Maggie. Look, okay. Number one. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3766.98s)]
*  If you try and convince me Lisa is a conservative. I'm not going to. I'm not going to. But Maggie, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3775.06s)]
*  there's an episode with Maggie where she goes to the Ayn Rand School for Tots. She's in her [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3780.9s)]
*  play school throwing a baseball like Steve McQueen. And by the way, I'm going to spoiler alert to [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3786.1s)]
*  anyone who hasn't seen it, but who shot Mr. Burns? The answer is Maggie Simpson, the baby who shot [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3792.9s)]
*  Mr. Burns was mean she's a gun owner. So I, so I, I claim four of the five as Republicans and Lisa Simpson [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3798.1800000000003s)]
*  is the embodiment of the left wing Democrat party. She is a smarty pants know it all who wants to [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3805.14s)]
*  lecture you, control you. She is a nanny state Nimwith and I'll take the rest of the family [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3811.06s)]
*  against Lisa. And I got to tell you the left lost their minds that I said that they got so angry [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3817.7s)]
*  that I said that because they feel they own art, they don't get to own art. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3826.5s)]
*  Art is in the eye and the heart of the consumer. Most important living conservative intellectual. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3830.5s)]
*  Okay. I'll expand living or dead. Elon Musk. Conservative intellectual. Really? Look, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3839.7s)]
*  Elon is and I've spent a lot of time with Elon. I consider Elon a friend. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3845.7s)]
*  Number one, he, he is smart as hell. And that look, you and I are both blessed to have known [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3850.4199999999996s)]
*  a lot of smart people. We have roughly 8 billion people on planet earth. There is somebody at the [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3856.3399999999997s)]
*  bleeding edge of intelligence. And I think Elon is that person. Like I love sitting down with Elon [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3863.46s)]
*  and talking because he look, you see him process. He doesn't just think outside the box. He doesn't [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3870.18s)]
*  know there is a box. It's an amazing thing. Now, all right, we've been launching rockets into space [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3875.22s)]
*  for 100 years. Everyone thought they knew how to do it. You launch a rocket into space. When you're [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3881.9399999999996s)]
*  done with it, you drop the booster in the ocean. It's gone. Elon says, well, no, no, let's just, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3886.3399999999997s)]
*  let's just reach up and grab them and use them again. Everyone said, well, that's an idiotic [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3890.8199999999997s)]
*  idea. You can't do that. He said, why can't we have giant chopsticks, pull a rocket out of the air [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3894.74s)]
*  and land it? Like that's a crazy ass idea that he's doing. I was a couple of months ago down [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3899.14s)]
*  at Boca Chica with Elon and President Trump. We're walking through. So five years ago, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3905.14s)]
*  Boca Chica was an empty beach at the southern tip of Texas. Nothing was there. He's built an entire [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3910.42s)]
*  city with such precision. They're making a rocket ship a month that is precise down to a tenth of [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3916.9s)]
*  a millimeter. He's built an entire city out of it, including, by the way, a tiki bar so that [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3923.3s)]
*  their employees are happy and can go get fruity drinks. And it's interesting. We're walking [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3926.98s)]
*  through. I'm going to give this as another example of thinking outside the box. Elon articulated a [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3932.9s)]
*  view on intellectual property I've never heard anyone else say. He walked through and he said, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3936.9s)]
*  he said, look, this is all basically alien technology. He said, we don't bother to patent [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3941.86s)]
*  most of it. He said, I assume people will steal everything we do. But by the time they steal it, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3947.14s)]
*  we'll be four or five generations advanced. So I don't care if they steal our old stuff. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3952.26s)]
*  Now I've talked with lots of entrepreneurs. I've never heard anyone else articulate that view of IP. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3956.42s)]
*  So I will say, and by the way, Elon tweeted out a GIF several years ago that I think sums up, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3961.7s)]
*  sums up actually you as well. And it was a GIF to the political spectrum from right to left. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3968.74s)]
*  And it showed Elon somewhat center left. And then the second graph was the spectrum moved [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3974.82s)]
*  dramatically. And suddenly he's right of center going, wait, I didn't move at all. But you people [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3981.62s)]
*  are insane. And there was a time not that long ago where I think you considered yourself a liberal. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3985.38s)]
*  And then they went insane. I still consider myself a liberal when I look at the issues. And when I [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3991.14s)]
*  look at my general worldview, it's just that the a lot of people have hijacked what liberalism [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=3996.02s)]
*  agreed and they filled it with something else. Okay. Last few questions. Who is the best justice [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4002.66s)]
*  on the Supreme Court currently? Yes. Clarence Thomas, your McDonald's order. A quarter pounder [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4006.98s)]
*  with cheese, fries and a diet coke. Your best friend in the Senate, Mike Lee by far. Who is the [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4014.74s)]
*  most formidable Democrat in America right now? In America? All right. I'm going to answer the easy [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4020.1s)]
*  question, which is in the Senate. It's probably Dick Durbin. I think he's the smartest of the [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4028.3399999999997s)]
*  Democrats. In America, I don't know because they're in chaos right now. It's not Biden. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4033.06s)]
*  It's not Kamala. It was Obama. But they're in wreckage right now. So it will be whoever emerges [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4043.94s)]
*  from that wreckage. And I don't think that's happened yet. How do you rate a Josh Shapiro, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4050.98s)]
*  let's say? Promising? Dangerous. Dangerous why? Look, I think if Kamala had picked Josh Shapiro, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4055.78s)]
*  the chances were significantly higher she would have won. And I actually think that decision is [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4064.66s)]
*  a manifestation of the profound anti-Semitism that is normalized in the Democrat Party. Josh Shapiro, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4071.54s)]
*  it's not complicated that Pennsylvania is the most important swing state in the country. It's the [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4078.02s)]
*  largest swing state. Josh Shapiro is a relatively popular governor of Pennsylvania, is perceived [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4081.46s)]
*  as somewhat moderate. If he significantly increased the chances of her winning Pennsylvania, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4087.54s)]
*  the chances of her becoming president rises dramatically. As a Republican, I didn't want [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4092.8199999999997s)]
*  her to pick Josh Shapiro because I wanted her to lose. The fact that she didn't, I believe if his [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4097.38s)]
*  name was Josh Smith, he would have been the nominee. The only reason she didn't pick Josh Shapiro [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4103.62s)]
*  is because he's Jewish. And it's because she did not want to tick off the pro-Hamas wing of the [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4108.9800000000005s)]
*  Democrat Party. And it terrifies me that there is such a thing as a pro-Hamas wing of the Democrat [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4114.820000000001s)]
*  Party. So he's dangerous in that respect, but it's not clear that he will rise from the rubble. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4119.62s)]
*  Because today's Democrat Party continues to be radicalized even more, so I don't know that he [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4125.14s)]
*  rises from that rubble. Book that's had the biggest impact on your life. Look, the natural [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4130.58s)]
*  answer is the Bible, and that I think is true. I will say Atlas Shrugged is an extraordinary book. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4135.06s)]
*  Last question. Favorite of all the Founding Fathers? James Madison. Ted Cruz, thank you [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4141.46s)]
*  so much for making time for me this weekend. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4147.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdA--5MBCY&t=4155.14s)]
