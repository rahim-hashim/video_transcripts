*  now where you see in California, they just banned artificial food diets in schools. It was a unanimous [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NXMrCm_djU&t=5.28s)]
*  decision. All Democrats, all Republicans coming together. You see in the Bernie Sanders hearing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NXMrCm_djU&t=12.0s)]

*  And it's because we're all working together and it's amazing what can happen when we do that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NXMrCm_djU&t=31.599999999999998s)]
