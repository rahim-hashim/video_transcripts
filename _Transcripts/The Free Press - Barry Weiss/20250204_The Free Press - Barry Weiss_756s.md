Simon Sebag Montefiore is one of the most important historians alive today. His many books, like "Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar," "The Romanovs," and "Catherine the Great & Potemkin" are essential to understanding power, politics, revolution, dictatorships, and above all, human nature.

While most of Sebag Montefiore’s books are biographies of people, Jerusalem is a biography of a city—one that is “the house of the one God, the capital of two peoples, the temple of three religions, and she is the only city to exist twice—in heaven and on earth.” The book takes you through 3,000 years of Jerusalem’s history, from King David to Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu. It is a must-read. It has sold more than a million copies, and it has just been reissued in paperback.

With the ceasefire deal underway in Israel and with Donald Trump a few weeks into his second presidency, we could not think of a better person to talk to at this moment.

# Our “Holiday From History” Is Over | Simon Sebag Montefiore
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI)
*  A lot of people feel like the consensus politics that we grew up under. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm thinking about Clinton, I'm thinking about the idea that history had ended, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=5.44s)]
*  it sort of alluded to it, that liberalism and capitalism were obviously better and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=9.36s)]
*  therefore we're going to conquer the world. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  That now seems so naive. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  How did we get that so wrong? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=18.2s)]
*  How did so many so-called experts tell us that we had sort of come to an end, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=20.6s)]
*  of history itself, and that's so obviously whether it's Trump here or [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  Maloney or Malay or I could go on and on and on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=32.76s)]
*  People are enthusiastically electing those that stand for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=36.44s)]
*  a very different set of values. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=41.04s)]
*  Well, I think what we're coming out of is an extraordinary period. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=42.839999999999996s)]
*  We're coming out of what I would call, depending on how you calculate it, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  the 70-year piece or the 75-year piece. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=49.44s)]
*  But in 1945, there was such a shock that all sorts of things became clear. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=52.28s)]
*  All sorts of taboos were established. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=57.96s)]
*  For example, we're talking in a synagogue here, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=60.28s)]
*  the taboo of antisemitism itself. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=62.96s)]
*  But also, it became self-evident that Western liberal democracy was the right, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=66.88s)]
*  the freest, the most open society in which to live. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=72.68s)]
*  And the values that that engendered brought us great advances in world affairs, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=77.8s)]
*  the rules-based world order, supranational organization, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  United Nations, the idea of world human rights. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=88.8s)]
*  And then in the 60s, what I call the great liberal reformation of gay rights, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=93.24s)]
*  abortion, the pill, all this sort of thing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=99.28s)]
*  None of that was challenged by anyone for a very long time. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=103.64s)]
*  And so America could go about its mission of selling those ideas to the world. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=108.28s)]
*  And then, of course, the Soviet Union fell. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=114.32s)]
*  But it's interesting for us to realize that there had never been a period like this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=117.8s)]
*  in world history. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  This wasn't normal. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=123.63999999999999s)]
*  Normally, everybody's against everybody. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=125.36s)]
*  Most world history is about a multipurpose, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=127.56s)]
*  most world history is about a multiplayer game. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  But that was a game of chess between two great players, Soviet Union and United States. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=134.64s)]
*  When that ended, America lost its way, and America was the uni power. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  And for whatever reason, some of them understandable, some of them preposterous, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=145.44s)]
*  America squandered that moment, partly with the Iraq War, the disaster of the Iraq War. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=151.56s)]
*  And out of that has come a reordering, a return to normalcy, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=160.28s)]
*  in which it's ever more important that our society, especially liberal democracies, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=164.96s)]
*  keep their solidarity, their coherence. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=170.36s)]
*  And it's at this very moment that we're actually eating ourselves in an act of self-mutilation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=173.36s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=180.36s)]
*  I mean, there's become a challenge from within society itself. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=184.24s)]
*  The entitlements that people believe are owed to them by their societies, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=191.92s)]
*  some of them financial in the comfort democracies of Europe, like Britain and Canada, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=199.32s)]
*  and some of them the result of law itself, out of human rights law. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=205.92s)]
*  But all of these things have created loyalties that are greater than to the state. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=212.16s)]
*  And as Rousseau said, someone says, what does the state mean to me? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=219.0s)]
*  The state is lost. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=223.24s)]
*  And JFK quoted that as well, because it's a quote that makes you realize the stakes at the moment are very high. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=225.12s)]
*  So many things became unsayable, and so many things lack sense, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=232.84s)]
*  that it's very easy for populists from right and left to claim that they can solve these problems. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  But the point is that one of my great heroes, the historian Ibn Khaldun, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  the Arab historian from the 14th century, he said many fascinating things. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  But one of the things he said, he said, states don't fall from military defeats. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=257.44s)]
*  They usually fall because of psychology. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=262.36s)]
*  And that's worth thinking about. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=266.56s)]
*  If you had to diagnose the psychology of America in the West right now, in a few lines, what would it be? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=268.4s)]
*  It's a crisis of self-confidence, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  a crisis in which people have forgotten that the freedoms and values that they hold were fought for. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  And the walls are pretty unpleasant things, but those fights were worth joining. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  And that is the crisis today. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=296.36s)]
*  I mean, if you look at our nation, we kind of generally agree that nation states are the best way to organize countries and empires onto a good thing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  But of course, nation states are very flawed things. They exclude people. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=307.64s)]
*  They have borders. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  They have borders. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=312.68s)]
*  And if you're not in the nation, however that nation is defined, that can be an uncomfortable situation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=313.92s)]
*  So there are flaws from nation states. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=322.76s)]
*  But I just wonder, you know, the young people that went off to fight for democracies in World War II, for example, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=325.12s)]
*  how many of the present young generation would fight for their nation now? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=331.4s)]
*  And yet those nations can represent the highest ideas and values. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=337.76s)]
*  I'm kind of old fashioned, but I believe that America represents the highest values of freedom. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  I believe in that stuff. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=351.96s)]
*  Well, if you polled most Israelis, there wouldn't be a question. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=353.8s)]
*  If you polled most Americans, and there are polls, the number of conservatives or Republicans, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=356.68s)]
*  I'm forgetting the details that would serve as higher than they are for Democrats, but they're low across the board in America. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=361.48s)]
*  I want to pick up on what you were saying about the return to normalcy, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=367.08s)]
*  Like the return to the mean of history and this idea that the things that growing up I took for granted, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  like gravity, now seem up for debate, or at least not at all guaranteed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=376.4s)]
*  I think that the expression that's been used so much in the American Jewish community since October 7th [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=384.56s)]
*  and really the whole diasporic Jewish community is this sense that the old world is shattered. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=392.2s)]
*  And people have been talking about how they felt like they were on a holiday from history, and that is over. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=397.67999999999995s)]
*  I want to ask you about that phenomenon. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=405.08000000000004s)]
*  Like has there ever been a people, ever, that had the luxury of being on a holiday from history? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=407.36s)]
*  Like how did we even get that luxury? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=414.92s)]
*  Well, it's an extraordinary thing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  The word golden age has been used a lot in the last couple of days. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=420.48s)]
*  But that has definitely, we are definitely, and the bad news is we, most of us here looking around, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  grew up in the golden age of the Jewish nation, of the Jewish great, of the Jewish people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=434.32s)]
*  A unique phase that we have been so fortunate. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=440.56s)]
*  And yes, we didn't realize how fortunate we were. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=444.64s)]
*  Though our sort of parents told us, but we didn't really believe them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=448.44s)]
*  And I guess one would date it from 1947 to sort of maybe till October 7th, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=452.20000000000005s)]
*  was the golden age of Jewish people, unique in his, just as the world peace, the 70-year peace, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  the rules, which is known as the rules-based world order, is absolutely unique in world history. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=473.0s)]
*  So was the holiday, as you call it, of the Jewish people since 19, let's say 1947. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=481.16s)]
*  Looking back, now that it feels like that age has come to a close and we're on the cusp of a new emergent age [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=489.52s)]
*  that we're not sure what it looks like, although I want to have you outline some of the characteristics of this new age, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=495.72s)]
*  was there anything that we could have done differently to keep the golden age going? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=503.32s)]
*  And where did we go wrong? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=508.4s)]
*  Well, I think the big mistake was, and this isn't just a Jewish thing, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=510.12s)]
*  this is about liberals in the wider sense of the word, in the sense of liberal, democratic liberals, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=514.68s)]
*  which probably includes most people in this room, most people in New York probably. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=522.64s)]
*  You don't mean liberals in a partisan sense, you mean it in like the capacious sense of the word. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=529.76s)]
*  I mean in the wider sense of the word. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=533.72s)]
*  But I think education has been the big... [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=536.56s)]
*  Education and supernationals and non-government and organizations, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=541.1199999999999s)]
*  I think government has completely ignored and neglected these areas. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=547.7199999999999s)]
*  I think people have been far too accepting of views that they knew were unacceptable but thought didn't matter. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=553.4s)]
*  I think that the biggest mistake is in our schools but even more in the academy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=560.36s)]
*  So for example, just to articulate it, maybe go a little further, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=566.88s)]
*  the idea that America is bad or evil or not the greatest, the most exceptional nation, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=570.0s)]
*  that is an idea that I heard probably expressed in different language every single day that I was in college. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=576.44s)]
*  And no one challenged it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=583.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=584.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a bigger thing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=585.6s)]
*  It's like the idea that you can reverse history, unpick history, go back in history, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=588.2s)]
*  and then adjudicate using violence now who was right and who was wrong. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  Because that is in fact what that particular ideology, which whatever you call it, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=603.96s)]
*  that was the ideology that has taken over much of university life. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=612.0s)]
*  And we didn't really notice it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=616.64s)]
*  We were sort of all taught it but we didn't really take it seriously. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=618.28s)]
*  And we didn't realize that it could have real life effects. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=621.76s)]
*  And I think October the 7th was, to call it a wake-up call, is an understatement. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=625.24s)]
*  You know, we realized that, I mean, the parallel is in those kind of, when you read about ethnic conflicts, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=632.04s)]
*  you know those ethnic conflicts and you read about it and you say, you know, we live together for, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=638.1999999999999s)]
*  our families lived next door to each other for sort of 60 years. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=641.88s)]
*  And then suddenly they came around and slit our throats. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=645.24s)]
*  I mean, it is like a much more peaceful Western bland version of that, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  where people that we trusted, professors, journalists, charity workers, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=655.24s)]
*  suddenly started celebrating on October the 7th, you know, the killing of civilians, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=662.08s)]
*  the murder of grandmothers, the rape of girls, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  and the stealing of people as an act of war. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, that was a terrible moment and I think we all went through it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=680.0s)]
*  And it was astonishing. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=686.04s)]
*  And I was watching it because Twitter is so ghastly in many ways, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=689.36s)]
*  but it's also so valuable and so unique in many ways. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=693.5999999999999s)]
*  Because if you're interested, if you avoid all those horrible arguments and the trolls and the morons and the pub bores, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=696.8399999999999s)]
*  you can actually find experts and also watch amazing historical events kind of live. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=705.92s)]
*  So it's an amazing thing and an amazing facility. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=712.24s)]
*  But that day, I remember sort of watching professors who sort of at Harvard and Yale and Princeton, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=717.4799999999999s)]
*  suddenly saying, no, no, this is just a wonderful act of resistance. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=725.4s)]
*  And that was terrifying, wasn't it? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg2QNxrpBI&t=730.28s)]
